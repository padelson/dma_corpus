Budgeted Expenditures made between January 1, 2004 and the date hereof and all
other capital expenditures, including Budgeted Expenditures, permitted to be
made under this Agreement or otherwise approved by Buyer and made prior to
the Effective Date over (y) $2,700,000, (iv) minus the excess, if any, of
$2,700,000 over the aggregate amount of Budgeted Expenditures actually made
prior to the Effective Date, (v) plus the aggregate amount of any capital
expenditures made after the Effective Date which are permitted to be made
under this Agreement or otherwise approved by Buyer, to the extent that such
amount is paid or financed by the Seller and not paid or financed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries out of cash generated after the Effective Date
(and for purposes of the clause (v), the Seller agrees to be bound by Section
5.01(d) hereof), and (vi) minus the aggregate amount of all Agreed-Upon Title
Defect Amounts finalized by Closing (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase

adjustment as provided in Section 2.04 and Section 2.05.



(b) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth Companys good faith
estimate of (i) the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount and (ii) the
amount of the Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase Price"), accompanied by
a reasonably detailed computation of such estimates, including supporting
schedules and other relevant information (such statement, the "Purchase Price
Statement").



 

9 Section 2.02. _Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale
of the Interests hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, on or after January 3,
2005, but in no event later than five Business Days, after satisfaction on or
after January 3, 2005 of the conditions set forth in Article 9, or at such
other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree. At the Closing:



(a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Estimated Purchase Price in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller with a
bank designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be
delivered not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or if
not so designated, then by certified or official bank check payable in
immediately available funds to the order of Seller in such amount).



(b) Seller shall deliver to Buyer an agreement of assignment assigning to
Buyer or its designee all of Sellers right, title and interest to the
Interests.



Section 2.03 _. Effective Date Balance Sheet._ (a) As promptly as practicable,
but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer the Effective Date Balance Sheet and a
certificate based on such Effective Date Balance Sheet setting forth Sellers
good faith calculation of the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount. The
Effective Date Balance Sheet (the "Effective Date Balance Sheet") shall (x)
fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date (taking into account the distribution of
the Distributed Assets as contemplated by Section 9.02(c)) in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with those used in the preparation of the
Balance Sheet, (y) include line items substantially consistent with those in
the Balance Sheet and (z) be prepared in accordance with accounting policies
and practices consistent with those used in the preparation of the Balance
Sheet.



(b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Effective Date Net
Working Capital Amount delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a), Buyer
may, within 20 days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section
2.03(a), deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing with such calculation which
specifies Buyers calculation of such amount and, in reasonable detail,
Buyers grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall
specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees, and Buyer shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Effective Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Effective Date Net
Working Capital Amount delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a).



 

10 (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such delivery,
use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of the
Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount, which amount shall not be more
than the amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) nor less than the amount thereof shown in Buyers calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b). If, during such period, Buyer and
Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material
relationship with Buyer or Seller) (the "Accounting Referee"), promptly to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount. Each party shall
set forth in writing its estimate of the Effective Date Net Working Capital
Amount referred to the Accounting Referee for resolution, and the Accounting
Referee shall, as promptly as practicable, be required to select the position
of either one party or the other with respect to the Effective Date Net
Working Capital Amount and to communicate such selection to both parties. The
costs of the Accounting Referee shall be borne entirely by the party which
does not have its position selected by the Accounting Referee. The
determination of the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties and shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction.



(d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and the Company and each Subsidiary to, cooperate and
assist in the preparation of the Effective Date Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount and in the
conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.03, including the making
available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and
personnel.



Section 2.04 _. Adjustment of the Purchase Price._ (a) If the Effective Date
Net Working Capital Amount as shown in the Purchase Price Statement exceeds
the Final Net Working Capital Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided
in Section 2.04(b), the amount of such excess. If Final Net Working Capital
Amount exceeds the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount as shown in
the Purchase Price Statement, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided
in Section 2.04(b), the amount of such excess. The "Final Net Working Capital
Amount" means the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount (i) as shown in
Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a), if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed
by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.03(c) or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as determined by the Accounting  



 

11  Referee pursuant to Section 2.03(c), taken together with the amounts that
have been agreed (or deemed agreed) by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section
2.03(b) and Section 2.03(c); _provided_ that in no event shall the Final Net
Working Capital Amount be more than the Sellers calculation of the Effective
Date Net Working Capital Amount delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or less
than Buyers calculation of the Effective Date Net Working Capital Amount
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b).



(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.04(a) shall be made within five days
after the Final Net Working Capital Amount has been determined (x) in the
case of payments made by Buyer, by delivery by Buyer of immediately available
funds to an account previously designated by Seller or (y) in the case of
payments made by Seller, by delivery by Seller of immediately available funds
to and account previously designated by Buyer. The amount of any payment to
be made pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the Prime Rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, in effect from time to time during the period from the
Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the
same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.



(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the purchase price adjustment to be made
pursuant to this Section 2.04 is meant to reflect changes in the current
assets and current liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries from the
date of the Balance Sheet to the date of the Effective Date Balance Sheet. The
purchase price adjustment is not intended to be used to adjust for errors or
omissions that may be found with respect to the Balance Sheet or the Effective
Date Net Working Capital Amount.



Section 2.05 _. Title Defects. _ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in no event later than 30 days
following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller written
notices identifying each matter that it believes in good faith to be a Title
Defect, together with a reasonable, good faith estimate of the associated
Title Defect Amount for each such alleged Title Defect, and reasonable written
documentation, to support Buyers claims of each such Title Defect
(the "Title Defect Notice"). In order for Seller to review the alleged Title
Defects listed in the Title Defect Notice, Buyer will provide to Seller and
its representatives copies of any documents used to determine the existence of
a Title Defect and the estimated (x) cost of curing a Title Defect or (y) if
such Title Defect cannot be cured, Damages resulting from the existence of
such Title Defect.



 

12 (b) If Seller disagrees with the existence of a Title Defect or the associated
Title Defect Amount, then Seller shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in
writing (a "Notice of Disagreement") within 10 days after its receipt of the
applicable Title Defect Notice. Such Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail Sellers grounds for such disagreement, the Title Defect
Amount estimated by Seller therefor, or both, as the case may be. To the
extent Seller does not contest a Title Defect or a Title Defect Amount in a
Notice of Disagreement within 10 days after its receipt of the applicable
Title Defect Notice, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the existence of
such Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, which shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder.



(c) If a Notice of Disagreement is timely provided by Seller, Buyer
and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 10 days
after delivery of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as they
may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the existence
of any Title Defect or Title Defect Amount contested in the Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then, upon the written request of either party, Seller and
Buyer agree that within a further 15 day period, they will jointly select an
arbitrator who is an attorney experienced in the natural gas and gas gathering
industry in the United States as well as in real estate and title insurance
matters, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the "Title
Defect Arbitrator"), to resolve any remaining disagreements. If Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree upon the designation of a Person as a Title Defect
Arbitrator, they shall request the American Arbitration Association to
appoint the Title Defect Arbitrator and such Title Defect Arbitrator shall
hear all matters submitted under this Section 2.05(c).



(d) The Title Defect Arbitrator shall determine as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within 30 days) following the date on which such dispute
is referred to the Title Defect Arbitrator the existence of any alleged Title
Defect or the disputed Title Defect Amount, as the case may require,
identified in the Notice of Disagreement and not previously resolved by the
parties. Each party shall set forth in writing its position regarding the
existence of each alleged Title Defect and each Title Defect Amount referred
to the Title Defect Arbitrator for resolution, and the Title Defect Arbitrator
shall be required to select the position of either one party or the other
with respect to each such Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, as the case may
require. The costs of the Title Defect Arbitrator shall be borne entirely by
the party which does not have its position selected by the Title Defect
Arbitrator. The determination of the Title Defect Arbitrator shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be enforceable in any court
having jurisdiction.



 

13 (e) As used in this Agreement, an "Agreed-Upon Title Defect" shall mean any of
(i) a Title Defect that is not contested under any Notice of Disagreement,
(ii) a Title Defect that is mutually agreed upon or deemed agreed by Buyer and
Seller or (iii) a Title Defect resulting from a determination of the Title
Defect Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.05(d) above. An "Agreed-Upon Title
Defect Amount" shall mean any of (i) a Title Defect Amount that is not
contested under any Notice of Disagreement, (ii) a Title Defect Amount that is
mutually agreed upon or deemed agreed by Buyer and Seller or (iii) a Title
Defect Amount resulting from a determination of the Title Defect Arbitrator
pursuant to Section 2.05(d) above.



(f) At Closing the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any
Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount finalized by Closing, except to the extent
Seller has cured any Title Defect or Agreed-Upon Title Defect, as the case
may be, at its own expense prior to Closing; _provided_ that Seller shall not
be entitled to use cash or cash equivalents generated after the Effective Date
( _e.g._ , cash or cash equivalents relating to receivables due at any time
after the Effective Date) in order to cure any Title Defect or Agreed-Upon
Title Defect. After Closing, the Seller shall pay to Buyer any Agreed-Upon
Title Defect Amount finalized after Closing within five days after such
amount is finalized. Buyer understands and agrees that the Purchase Price
adjustment provided in this Section 2.05 is the sole and exclusive remedy for
a Title Defect, and no claim may be made by Buyer with respect to any
representation or warranty made by Seller or any of its affiliates or
representatives. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.05 or
Section 2.01, the Purchase Price shall not be decreased by any Agreed-Upon
Title Defect Amount unless and until the aggregate Agreed-Upon Title Defect
Amount exceeds $400,000, and then only to the extent of such excess.



(g) For purposes of this Section 2.05, "Title Defect" shall not include any
Title Defect of which the Buyer becomes aware through any "self-help" actions
such as surveys, or letters or notices to third parties other than through
customary and routine title due diligence.



Section 2.06 _. Allocation of Purchase Price._ As soon as practicable after
the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation
Statement"), allocating the Purchase Price (plus the liabilities of the
Company Group to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of
the Code) among the assets of the Company Group in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code. If within 10 days after the delivery of the Allocation
Statement Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to the
allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In
the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 20
days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain independent accountants of
nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory  



 

14  to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer
or Seller) (the "Tax Allocation Referee") to resolve the disputed items. Upon
resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation
Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Tax Allocation Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer
and Seller. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected
on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution.
Seller and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement and (ii)
act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing
and audit of any Tax Return (including filing Form 8594 with its federal
income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing).
Not later than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594
relating to this transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a
copy of its Form 8594.

state in which any material property or facility is located. No portion of the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary are subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the

Section 3.21 _. Tax Matters._ Except as set forth in Schedule 3.21:



All material Tax returns, statements, reports and forms, including any

23  Taxing Authority on or before the date hereof by, or with respect to,
Company or any Subsidiary have been timely filed on or before the Closing
Date, and all such Returns are true, correct and complete in all material
respects. The Company and the Subsidiaries have paid all material Taxes due
and payable on or before the date hereof. The charges, accruals and reserves
for Taxes with respect to Company and the Subsidiaries reflected on the books
of Company and the Subsidiaries are adequate, under GAAP, to cover material
Tax liabilities accruing through the end of the last period for which the
Company and the Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their respective
books. There is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now
proposed, pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against or with
respect to Company or any Subsidiary in respect of any material Tax.
There are no Liens on any of the assets of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to
pay any Tax. The Company properly and timely filed the appropriate forms to
effect the Section 338(h)(10) Elections with respect to the transactions
consummated pursuant to the CMS Agreement. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries is "disregarded as an entity separate from its owner" within the
meaning of Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-3. None of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereto) has ever been an entity taxable as a
corporation for federal income Tax purposes. All material Tax withholding and
deposit requirements imposed on or with respect to any of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries have been satisfied in full in all respects. None of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries is subject to any material liability for
the Taxes of any other Person under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or
any analogous state, local or foreign law, or otherwise, as a transferee, or
successor. All material assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries have been
included on the property tax rolls of the Tax jurisdictions in which the
property is located and there is no omitted property in such jurisdictions.
None of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Seller has entered into a
transaction that would be reportable under Treasury Regulation section
1.6011-4 or any predecessor thereto. For purposes of this agreement, "Tax"
means any tax, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, withholding on amounts paid to or
by any Person, real and personal property taxes and real property transfer
taxes), and any liability for any of the foregoing that arises as a transferee
or successor), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or
additional amount imposed by any Governmental Authority (domestic or foreign)
responsible for the imposition of any such tax, governmental fee, assessment
or charge (a "Taxing Authority").



Section 3.22. _Environmental Matters_. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.22
and except as to matters that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect:

complaint or penalty has been received by Seller, the Company or any

audit conducted within the past five years by, on behalf of, or in the
possession or control of the Company or any Subsidiary of any property
currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by the Company or any
Subsidiary which has not been delivered or made available to Buyer prior to
the date hereof;



(d) no Hazardous Substances have been released, discharged, dumped or
disposed of to (i) soil in amounts that would reasonably be expected to impact
groundwater or surface water, (ii) groundwater, or (iii) surface water, in the
case of each of (i), (ii) and (iii), at, under, on or from real property
currently or, to the knowledge of Seller, formerly owned, leased, and/or
operated by the Company or any Subsidiary;



(e) all real property owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary as of
July 2, 2003 is identified as an insured site under the Environmental Policy;
and



(f) to the knowledge of Seller, there is no real property owned or leased by
the Company or any Subsidiary where operations are inactive or discontinued as
of the date hereof.



Section 3.23 _. Adequacy of Assets._ The assets to be owned by Buyer
immediately after the Closing will, to the knowledge of Seller, be adequate
to permit Buyer to conduct the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries
in Oklahoma and Texas in substantially the same manner as conducted
immediately prior to the Closing in Oklahoma and Texas; _provided_ that the
Company shall, as contemplated by Section 9.02(c), distribute from the
Company (among other things) those assets identified under the headings
"Trademarks," "Accounts Receivable and Prepays," "Accounts Payable," "Cash
at Closing," "Insurance Policies and Bonds," "Software," "Office Equipment and
Furnishings," "Field Equipment" and "Agreements" on Schedule 9.02(c).

surety bonds, letters of credit, or cash collateral issued in respect of any
member of the Company Group is outstanding.



Section 3.26 _. Suspense Accounts._ Seller has previously made available to
Buyer a copy of all information in its possession relating to monies held in
suspense accounts.

the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) the communication by such
counsel to any such Designated Person, in any such representation, of any fact
known to such counsel, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or
following the Closing; _provided_ that such waiver shall not be deemed to be
or used as a basis for contending that the Company or any Subsidiary has
waived its attorney-client privilege (it being understood that any information
which any such Designated Person or legal counsel learned prior to the Closing
shall not be prohibited by virtue of this Section 6.05 from being used in
connection with any such representation by such legal counsel of such

34 Section 7.02. _Certain Filings_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any governmental body, agency, official or authority is required, or any

the Buyer and the Companies at a price equal to 160% of the base salary of
each employee assigned by the Seller or its Affiliates to the provision of
such services (which represents the allocation of salary and direct overhead
to personnel involved in providing such services), adjusted for the portion of
each such employees time actually spent providing such services to the

employees of the Company Group shall be transferred to or retained by Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller, as the case may be.



(b)



(i) For a period of twelve months from the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it
will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, provide the Transferred Employees
with compensation, benefits and responsibilities that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the compensation, benefits and responsibilities
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer.



(ii) Buyer further agrees that (x) with respect to Transferred Employees
other than the Dallas Employees, it will not relocate any such employee to a
location greater than twenty (20) miles from their present employment location
and (y) it shall not relocate any of the Dallas Employees in connection with
their employment by Buyer.



(iii) 



(A) With respect to Companys 401(k) retirement plan ("Company 401(k) Plan"),

Transferred Employees under the Company 401(k) Plan.



 

37 (B) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cover, or cause its subsidiaries to
cover, each Transferred Employee under one or more other defined contribution
plans and trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code
(collectively, "Buyer DC Plans") on the same basis as similarly situated Buyer
employees and on terms that reflect the service credit provisions of Section
8.01(b)(vi).



(C) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall effect the
transfer of the records and non-taxable plan-to-plan transfer of assets of all
Transferred Employees under the Company 401(k) Plan to Buyers defined
contribution plan. No Transferred Employee shall, with respect to his account
in the Company 401(k) Plan, have the option to leave it in that plan or
receive a distribution thereof from that plan.



(iv) Buyer shall grant the Transferred Employees credit for years of
uninterrupted prior service with Company Group or its predecessors for
purposes of its Paid Time Off benefit program (Buyers vacation and sick leave
plan), and Transferred Employees shall be credited with Paid Time Off Days on
January 1, 2005 in the same manner as any other similarly situated employees
of Buyer are credited. Any unused vacation as of December 31, 2004 for
Transferred Employees shall be cashed out by Seller and all costs associated
with cashing out such Transferred Employees shall be borne by Seller.



(v) Buyer will, and will cause its subsidiaries to:



(A) where reasonably possible, waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any
health and welfare plans in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date to the extent that such limitations were
waived under the applicable Employee Plan; and



(B) where reasonably possible, provide each Transferred Employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
health and welfare plans that such Transferred Employees are eligible
to participate in after the Closing Date.



 

38 (vi) Except as to retiree benefit coverage, Buyer shall provide each
Transferred Employee with full credit for all service with the Company Group
for purposes of eligibility under any health or welfare plans or arrangements
provided by Buyer after the Closing Date and for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under Buyer DC Plans to the extent such service was credited under a
similar Benefit Plan as of the Closing; _provided_ such eligibility and
vesting is permitted and/or does not adversely impact such plans.



(c) Seller represents and warrants that the employees in the Company Group
participate in no pension plans, retirement plans, or deferred compensation
plans other than the Company 401(k) Plan, and do not participate in any
welfare plan that provides retiree benefits.



(d) Any Transferred Employee who (A) accepts an offer of employment from Buyer
at Closing and is subsequently terminated other than for cause within one (1)
year of the Closing Date or (B) rejects an offer of employment from Buyer at
Closing (which offer of employment did not meet the requirements of Section
8.01(b)(i) or required that, in the case of the Dallas Employees, such
employee relocate or, in the case of the other Transferred Employees, such
employee relocate employment to a location greater than twenty (20) miles from
his or her present employment location) and does not otherwise accept another
offer of employment from Buyer at Closing shall be entitled to severance from
Buyer in an amount calculated in accordance with Companys severance program
in existence immediately prior to the Closing Date (assuming for purposes of
such calculation that such Transferred Employee were entitled to severance
thereunder).



(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this
Section 8.01 shall be construed to limit in any way the ability of Buyer or
its subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee from
and after the Closing Date or to terminate or modify any employee benefit
plan or program of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, including Company, after
the Closing Date.



(f) This Article 8 is expressly not intended to provide any Transferred
Employees or any other employee of Seller or its Affiliates a separate cause
of action against Buyer or Seller or their Affiliates, and the duties and
obligations of Seller and Buyer to each other are intended to be enforceable
only between them, and do not grant any benefits, duties or obligations to any
third party, including but not limited to the employees of Buyer or the
employees of Seller or any Affiliate the Seller.

Article 11 hereof shall survive beyond the Closing.



Section 11.02 _. Indemnification of Buyer for Certain Matters._ Effective as
of and after the Closing, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates
against and agrees to defend and hold each of them harmless from any and all
damage, loss and expense (including reasonable expenses of investigation and
reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses in connection with
any action, suit or proceeding whether involving a third party claim or a
claim solely between the parties hereto) ("Damages") threatened, suffered or
incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates arising out of or attributable
to (a) any breach or alleged breach by the Company of its obligations
pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(i) of the CMS Agreement, (b) the Distributed Assets
or any liability or obligation of Cantera Gas Holdings or its subsidiaries
(determined as of immediately prior to the Closing) or (c) the obligations of
the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to either of the Enbridge Agreements,
_provided_ that this Section 11.02 shall not apply to any Damages that are
attributable to any liability for Taxes imposed on the Company or any
Subsidiary or to any liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without
limitation, expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses)
arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any
such Tax (indemnity for which shall be covered as provided in Section 11.03).



Section 11.03 _. Indemnification of Buyer for Certain Tax Matters._ (a)
Effective as of and after the Closing, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer against
and agrees to hold it harmless from any (i) liability for Taxes imposed on
the Company or any Subsidiary relating to a Pre-Effective Date Tax Period,
including, without limitation, any liability that arises under Treasury
Regulations § 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law
or regulation, or pursuant to a Tax sharing or indemnification agreement or
arrangement and (ii) liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys and
accountants fees and expenses) arising out of or incident to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any liabilities described in (i), including those
incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to
the imposition, assessment or assertion of such liabilities, in each case
incurred or suffered by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Company or any
Subsidiary after the Effective Date (each of (i) and (ii) being referred to as
a "Loss"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall be obligated to make
payments to Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.03 only to the extent that the
cumulative amount  



 

43  that would otherwise be payable by Seller pursuant to this Section 11.03
(notwithstanding this proviso) exceeds the reserve for Taxes reflected in the
Final Net Working Capital Amount and _provided, further,_ that Seller shall
have no obligation to make any payment pursuant to this Section 11.03 in
respect of any Loss, or portion thereof, which CMS Gas Transmission Company
has agreed to indemnify pursuant to the CMS Agreement.



(b) For purposes of this Section 11.03, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes
(but does not end on) the Effective Date, the portion of such Tax related to
the portion of such Tax period ending on the Effective Date shall (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the relevant Tax period ended on the Effective Date. Any credits relating
to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the Effective Date shall be
taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the Effective
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise,
capital, or similar Tax (including the Texas franchise Tax) paid or payable
with respect to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall be allocated to
the Tax period during which the income, operations, assets or capital
comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right
to do business for another Tax period is obtained by the payment of such
franchise Tax.



(c) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller all refunds
of Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, the
Company, or any Subsidiary attributable to Taxes paid by Seller, the Company
or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor or Affiliate of Seller) with respect to
any Pre-Effective Date Tax Period. If, in lieu of receiving any such refund,
the Company or any Subsidiary reduces a Tax liability with respect to a Post-
Effective Date Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to
Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax liability.



(d) Any payment by Seller pursuant to this Section 11.03 shall be made not
later than 30 days after receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer
stating that any Loss has been paid by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or,
effective upon the Effective Date, the Company or any Subsidiary and
the amount thereof and of the indemnity payment requested.



(e) If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to this Section 11.03 is asserted in writing against Buyer,
any  



 

44  of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the Company or any Subsidiary,
Buyer shall notify Seller of such claim or demand within 20 days of
receipt thereof, or such earlier time that would allow Seller to timely
respond to such claim or demand, and shall give Seller such information with
respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyers failure to notify Seller within such time period shall not
relieve Seller of any of its indemnification obligations hereunder, unless the
failure to furnish such notice within such time period adversely affects in a
material manner Sellers ability to effectively contest such claim. Seller
may discharge, at any time, its indemnification obligation under this Section
11.03 by paying to Buyer the amount payable pursuant to this Section 11.03,
calculated on the date of such payment. Seller may, at its own expense,
participate in (and, upon notice to Buyer, with respect to a Tax period ending
on or before the Effective Date, assume) the defense of any such claim, suit,
action, litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit). If Seller assumes
such defense, Seller shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such
defense and Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by Seller; provided, however, that Seller shall not
enter into any settlement with respect to such contest without the written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Whether or
not Seller chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.



(f) Seller shall not be liable under this Section 11.03 for (i) any Tax paid
after the Closing Date the payment of which was made without Sellers prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) any
settlements effected without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, or resulting from any claim, suit, action, litigation
or proceeding with respect to which Seller was not notified pursuant to
Section 11.03.



(g) To the extent Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon any amounts
described in Section 11.03, such matter shall be resolved by a Tax Allocation
Referee in the manner described in Section 2.06.



Section 11.04 _. Procedures Relating To Indemnification Claims._ Buyer agrees
to give prompt notice to Seller of the assertion of any claim, or the
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity
may be sought pursuant to Section 11.02 or Section 11.03 (a "Claim") and
will provide Seller with such information relating thereto that the Seller
may reasonably request. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller, and Buyer shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Claim and shall furnish or
cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery  



 

45  proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith. Seller or its successors or assigns shall control
all aspects the defense or prosecution of any Claim and shall be entitled to
settle any Claim upon terms and conditions it deems appropriate in its sole
discretion; _provided_ that Seller shall obtain the prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Buyer or its Affiliate
entitled to indemnification hereunder for such Claim, as the case may be,
before entering into any settlement of such Claim if the settlement does not
release the Buyer or such Affiliate from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Buyer or such Affiliate.



Section 11.05 _. Purchase Price Adjustment and Interest_. Any amount paid by
Seller or Buyer under Section 11.02 or Section 11.03 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.



Section 11.06 _. Notices._ All notices, requests and other communications to
any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission and

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense.



Section 11.09. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto; _provided_ that Buyer may assign, in whole or in part, to one or more
of its wholly-owned subsidiaries its rights under this Agreement and
_provided further_ that (x) such assignment shall only be effective if, prior
to exercising such assigned rights, such permitted assignee agrees in writing
to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Agreement, to the extent
relevant to such assigned rights and (y) no such assignment shall relieve
Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.



Section 11.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New
York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of
action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a
transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on
any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction
of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.



 

48 Section 11.12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY

HEREBY.



Section 11.13. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. 



Section 11.14. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement.



Section 11.15. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.



Section 11.16. _Disclosure Schedules_. Company has or may have set forth
information on a Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section
of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of
a Schedule need not be set forth in any other Schedule so long as its

reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein to the
Person to which such disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and
agree that (a) the Schedules to this Agreement may include certain items and
information solely for informational  



 

49  purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure by Seller of
any matter in the Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is required to be disclosed by the
terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
