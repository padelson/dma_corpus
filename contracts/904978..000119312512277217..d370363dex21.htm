AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). By virtue of the Merger,
at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Company_ ") and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.2 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under the DGCL, the DLLCA and
other applicable Law. Section 1.3 _Closing; Effective Time of the Merger_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New York 10036
at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the later of (i) the second (2nd) Business Day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in
Article V to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) and (ii)
the earlier of (A) a date during the Marketing Period to be specified by
Parent on no fewer than two (2) Business Days notice to the Company and (B)
the first (1st) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period,
unless the parties to this Agreement otherwise agree in writing to another
place and time. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred
to as the " _Closing Date_."

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, in order to effect the
Merger, a certificate of merger that has been duly executed and acknowledged
in accordance with, and in such form as required by, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and the DLLCA shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware at the Closing. The Merger shall become effective at the
time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such other time as may be mutually determined
by the parties to this Agreement and set forth in such certificate of merger
(the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended to be
read as set forth in Exhibit A and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of
incorporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company, in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended to read as set forth on Exhibit
B and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company and such bylaws.

(c) The managers of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Company and the officers of the
Company immediately before the Effective Time, and certain other officers to
be identified by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Company, in each case until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Company as in effect from
time to time.

 



2 Section 1.5 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any stockholder of the
Company or any member of, or holder of an interest in, Merger Sub:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held in the Companys treasury or held
by the Company (other than shares of Company Common Stock that are held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity and are beneficially owned by third parties) or
by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to Sections
1.5(b) and 1.8, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive $8.50 in cash, payable without
interest (the " _Per Share Amount_ "); and

 

(iv) each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger Consideration_ " means the
cash payable to former stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section
1.5(a)(iii).

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, any change shall occur in the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange, readjustment or similar transaction, or if any
stock dividend shall be declared on shares of Company Common Stock and the
record date for such dividend shall fall during such period, then the Per
Share Amount and any other similarly dependent terms shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 1.6 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time:
(a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, upon the cancellation or conversion thereof in accordance
with Section 1.5, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and all holders of stock certificates (" _Stock Certificates_ ") and/or book-
entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the right to
receive the Per Share Amount with respect to each of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly evidenced thereby as

 



3  provided in Section 1.5 (or to appraisal rights as provided in Section 1.8
with respect to Dissenting Shares); and (b) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. 

Section 1.7 _Payment Fund; Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger
(the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5(a) (the funds
so deposited with the Paying Agent being referred to as the " _Payment Fund_
").

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery of Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall pass, in the case of Stock Certificates, upon delivery of the
Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent and, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal); and
(ii) customary instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Stock
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Amount with
respect to each of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Upon delivery to the Paying
Agent of Stock Certificates, together with a validly executed letter of
transmittal, and/or Book-Entry Shares, together with such evidence of
surrender, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, the holders
thereof shall be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall pay, the Per
Share Amount with respect to each of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Stock Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, and
the Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper
amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered is registered if: (A) such Stock Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer; and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall
either (1) pay any transfer tax required by reason of such payment, or (2)
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company and the
Paying Agent that such transfer tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Stock
Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Amount with respect to each of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced thereby. No interest will be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Stock Certificate or Book-Entry
Share.

 



4 (c) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.7(b),
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against either of them or the
Surviving Company with respect to such Stock Certificate, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay to such Person the applicable Merger Consideration
receivable with respect to the Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate. 

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains undistributed to former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by
the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Any former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.7
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company or Parent, and the
Surviving Company and Parent shall thereafter be jointly liable, for payment
of the Merger Consideration, in accordance with this Article I and without
any interest thereon, payable with respect thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date
that any unclaimed Merger Consideration would otherwise become subject to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, any unclaimed funds payable with
respect to such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company.

(e) The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent upon demand. Parent and the Surviving
Company shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this Section 1.7(e) so as to ensure
that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make all payments required under this Article I. Nothing contained herein and
no investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Stock Certificates and/or Book-Entry
Shares to receive Merger Consideration.

Section 1.8 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder
who is entitled to demand and has made a valid demand for appraisal of such
shares in accordance, and complies in all respects, with Section 262 of the
DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but rather shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting
Shares. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Dissenting Shares shall lose their
status as such (through failure to perfect, waiver, effective withdrawal or
otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of
such status, each of such shares shall automatically be converted into or
shall have deemed to have been, at the Effective Time, converted into, as
applicable, and shall

 



5  represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 1.5(a), without interest thereon, following the surrender of the Stock
Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal pursuant
to the DGCL received by the Company prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not make any payment, settle or offer to settle, or, in each case, agree to do
any of the foregoing, with respect to any such demand without the prior
written consent of Parent.

Section 1.9 _Company Options; Restricted Stock Units; Restricted Shares_. 

(a) _Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (whether vested or unvested) to be canceled and terminated and converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to
such Company Option; and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (but in any event no later than the payment date for the Companys
regularly scheduled first full payroll cycle following the Closing
Date), Parent shall cause to be paid to each Person who held a Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in cash, an amount, if any, equal to
the Option Consideration, without interest, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Company Option; provided, that if
the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Amount, such Company Option shall be canceled without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common
Stock issuable under a particular Company Option, the amount by which the Per
Share Amount exceeds the exercise price payable under such Company Option in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock.

(b) _Company RSUs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each
Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) to be canceled and terminated and converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Per
Share Amount, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock then
subject to such Company RSU (such cash amount being the " _Company RSU
Consideration_ "); and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (but in any event no later than the payment date for the Companys
regularly scheduled first full payroll cycle following the Closing Date),
Parent shall cause to be paid to each Person who held a Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in cash, an amount equal to the
Company RSU Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
issuable under such Company RSU; _provided_ that payment for any Company RSUs
issued under the Companys Non-Employee Directors Stock-for-Fees Program held
by a member of the board of directors of the Company who does not incur a
"separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code at or
immediately following the Effective Time shall not be made at such time and
shall instead be made on or within sixty (60) days following the first to
occur of (i) the directors separation from service or (ii) the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the date such Company RSUs were credited to the director.

 



6 (c) _Company Restricted Shares_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause each Company Restricted Share to be fully vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. Conditional upon the Closing, the
Company shall take all appropriate or necessary steps to effect the
termination of each Company Equity Plan as of the Effective Time, so that as
of the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Equity Plans,
Company Options or Company RSUs (other than the rights to receive the cash
payments contemplated by this Section 1.9) and the Company Restricted Shares
shall be treated as contemplated by Section 1.5.

 

Section 1.10 _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and
the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
Paying Agent, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company is required to
deduct and withhold from such consideration under the Code, the
Treasury Regulations or any corresponding provision of applicable Tax Law
(including any state, local, or foreign Tax Law). Each of the Paying Agent,
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company shall take all action that may
be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and
properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 1.11 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm or record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Company shall be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or
desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

or contractors.

 



34 (g) No material Breach has occurred with respect to any unsecured Protected

copies of all material survey (identifying deficiencies having scope-and-
severity ratings of G and higher) and other material Governmental Entity
reports, statements of deficiencies, plans of correction, audits and any other

filed, issued, sent and received with respect to the Facilities or provider
agreements of Governmental Entities since January 1, 2010 (collectively, "

further outstanding issues, or (iv) has been cited for any deficiency that
would result in a denial of payment for new admissions, civil monetary
penalty, termination, final revocation or cancellation of Healthcare Permits
or provider agreements of Governmental Entities, decertification or debarment,
in each case with no opportunity to correct and/or for which an acceptable
plan of correction has not been timely submitted, other than those instances
where the Acquired Entities have taken proper corrective action and there are
no further outstanding

 



35  material issues. Section 2.20(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains
a list of each Facility that has been formally found by a Governmental Entity
to not currently be in compliance with federal and state Healthcare Permit or

(j) To the Companys Knowledge, none of the Acquired Entities or Facilities,
their respective employees, agents or contractors, or other individuals or

are defined under applicable Healthcare Laws, relevant thereto and
interpreted by Governmental Entities) submitted, or participated in any way in
the submission, of any claim for payment to any patient of any Acquired Entity
or Facility or any third party payor of such a patient (including the
Medicare and Medicaid programs) or retained any payment for a claim, which is
not correct as submitted, supported by adequate and appropriate documentation
(which contains proper disclosure and adjustment of transactions with related
parties), or otherwise in accordance with Healthcare Laws. To the Companys
Knowledge, none of the Acquired Entities or Facilities, their respective
employees, agents or contractors, or other individuals or entities for whose
actions any of the Acquired Entities or Facilities is legally responsible,
has paid or participated in any way in the payment of any illegal remuneration

which would be reasonably likely to violate the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn, any
comparable state statute or other applicable Healthcare Laws.

(k) Each Facility is, as applicable, duly and properly accredited by the
accreditation bodies required by applicable Law listed in Section 2.20(k) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. There is no other accreditation by any
accreditation body required by applicable Laws, including Healthcare Laws, for
the operation of any Facility.

(l) None of the Acquired Entities or Facilities has an ongoing obligation with
respect to any funding received in connection with the Facilities under the
federal Hill-Burton Act.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained and maintained all material
provider agreements, certifications, and authorizations required from any
Payor and have obtained and maintained eligibility and good standing for
reimbursement from such Payor. There is no material Legal Proceeding pending
or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened by any Governmental Entity or
nongovernmental Payor with respect to (i) any alleged violation by any
Acquired Entity or Facility of any applicable Law, Order, policy or guideline
of any Governmental Entity or nongovernmental Payor involving or relating to
participation in any such Payors reimbursement program or eligibility to
receive payment; or (ii) any revocation, cancellation, rescission,
modification, or refusal to renew any agreements, certifications, or
authorization of any Payor. Since January 1, 2009, no material Payor agreement
has been revoked, cancelled, terminated, rescinded, modified or been subject
to a refusal to renew. The Company and its Subsidiaries have paid or made
provision to pay any material overpayment

 



36  received from any Payor and any similar material obligation with respect to
reimbursement programs in which any of the Acquired Entities or Facilities
participates (each of which, if incurred on or prior to December 31, 2011, is
reflected on the 2011 Year-End Balance Sheet). Each of the Acquired Entities
and Facilities is in compliance in all material respects with the conditions
of participation under such Government Programs in which it participates or
has participated. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2009, all
billing practices of the Acquired Entities and Facilities, as applicable, to
all Payors including the Government Programs and Private Programs, have been
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Healthcare Laws and

has operated since January 1, 2009) in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable material contractual obligations, billing
policies, procedures, limitations and restrictions of any Government Program

compliance with the terms of the Payor agreements under which it is presently
receiving payments.

Section 3.6 _Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub have delivered, on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Company true, correct and complete copies
of the fully executed commitment letters from (a) Barclays Bank PLC ("

40  Capital Markets, Inc. (" _GECM_ "), dated as of June 20, 2012 (the " _Term
Loan Financing Letter_ ") and (b) Barclays, GE Capital and GECM dated as
of June 20, 2012 (the " _ABL Financing Letter_ " and together with the Term
Loan Financing Letter, collectively, the " _Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to
which the Lead Lenders have committed, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, financing in the amount set forth therein for the purposes
of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
(being collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of
this Agreement, neither of the Financing Letters has been amended or modified

contemplated (other than amendments or modifications that are contemplated
by Section 4.9), and as of the date of this Agreement, the respective
obligations and commitments contained in the Financing Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any
reason to believe that (i) it or any other party thereto will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term of, or condition set forth in, any of the
Financing Letters on or prior to the Closing or (ii) the Financing will not be
made available to Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing. Except for fee
letters, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from Barclays, GE Capital and

removing only the fees payable on the Closing to the Lead Lenders and their
respective affiliates party thereto, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no side letters or agreements (whether written or oral) to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party related to the Financing, including any that
would affect the availability of the Financing, or which include conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Letters delivered to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent has fully paid or caused to be
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement,
and as of the date of this Agreement, each of the Financing Letters is in full
force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent
or Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Letters. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Letters, Parent and Merger Sub, in the aggregate and together with the
available cash and cash equivalents of the Company, will have at and after the
Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the
aggregate Option Consideration and the aggregate Company RSU Consideration,
(ii) finance the repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this
Agreement or the Financing Letters, (iii) pay any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company in
connection with the Merger and the Financing, and (iv) satisfy all of the
other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company
contemplated hereunder.

Parents controlled Affiliates beneficially owns any shares of Company Common
Stock.

Section 3.8  _Information Supplied_. The information provided in writing to
the Company by or on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 



41 Section 3.9 _Brokers_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., no broker, finder
or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other similar
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub.

 

Section 3.10 _Solvency; Surviving Company After the Merger_. Assuming that the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article II are
true and correct in all material respects, immediately after giving effect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) the
aggregate value of the assets of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis will exceed their total liabilities (including
contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities) at a fair
valuation and at fair saleable value; (ii) the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will have the ability to pay their
total debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and
unliquidated liabilities) as they become due in the usual course of their
business as such business is now conducted or proposed to be conducted
following such date; and (iii) the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital with
which to conduct their business. 

Section 3.11 _No Other Company Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Article II or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
advisors, agents or Representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is
making any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or
operations, including with respect to any information provided or made

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4.2(a),
until the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and its
Representatives may (i) provide information (including non-public information)
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made after the date of
this Agreement a written Alternative Acquisition Proposal if the Person so
requesting such information executes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (
_provided_ , that any non-public information provided to such Person,
including if made available on an electronic datasite, shall be provided or
made available to Parent prior to or

 



46  concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person), and (ii) engage
or participate in negotiations or discussions with any Person (including its
Representatives and potential financing sources) who has made after the date
of this Agreement a written Alternative Acquisition Proposal, if in the case
of each of clauses (i) and (ii), such Alternative Acquisition Proposal did not
result from a material breach of this Section 4.2 and the board of directors
of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section
4.2, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours of receipt) advise Parent in writing in the event (i) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys Knowledge, any of its or its
Subsidiaries Representatives receives (A) any written indication by any
Person that it intends to make an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (B) an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) any of the Companys "named
executive officers" (as defined by Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act) receives any indication by any Person that it intends to make an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, together with the material terms
and conditions of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the
Person making any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and a copy of any
written Alternative Acquisition Proposal provided by such Person. The Company
shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and
material terms and conditions (including, within twenty-four (24) hours, all
material amendments or modifications) of any such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal and shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
provide or make available to Parent a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided to the Company in connection with such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(e), neither the board of directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Merger, fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or adopt, approve or recommend or
propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act (it being understood that the board of directors of the Company
may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal until the close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer in connection with such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act without such action being considered an adverse modification of the
Company Recommendation) (each action set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this
Section 4.2(d), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ");

 



47 (iii) cause or permit the Company to approve, adopt, recommend or enter into,
or publicly propose to approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, a
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or
similar document, agreement or understanding with respect thereto (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ") relating to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 4.2 shall permit
the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement prior to
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms); or

 

(iv) take any action pursuant to Section 6.1(f).

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.2, at any time prior to
the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the board of
directors of the Company has received an Alternative Acquisition Proposal
(that has not been withdrawn) that the board of directors of the Company
determines constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the
Company may effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.1(f) if, and only if, prior to the board of directors of
the Company taking any such action:

 

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent a written notice, which
notice shall (1) state that the Company has received an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal which the board of directors of the Company has
determined is a Superior Proposal and that the board of directors of the
Company intends to take such action and (2) include the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal, the most current written draft agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and all
related transaction agreements, (B) provided such notice to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days prior to taking any such action (it being understood
that any material amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice and a new two (2) Business Day period) and (C) if
requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent during such four
(4) Business Day period regarding revisions to this Agreement which would
permit the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation or take action
pursuant to Section 6.1(f) in response to such a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company, within four (4) Business
Days after receipt by Parent of the notice described in Section 4.2(e)(i), a
written proposal capable of being accepted to amend the terms contemplated by
this Agreement or the Financing Letters, the board of directors of
the Company shall have in good faith determined (after consultation with
outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of such proposal by
Parent, that the Alternative Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

 

(f) The board of directors of the Company may also effect a Change of
Recommendation at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval
is obtained in the absence of a Superior Proposal if an Intervening Event
shall have occurred and be continuing and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation:

 



48 (i) the board of directors of the Company in good faith determines
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of
directors of the Company under applicable Law;

(ii) the board of directors of the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent a
written notice, which notice shall (1) state that an Intervening Event has
occurred and that the board of directors of the Company has determined that in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company under applicable Law
and that the Company intends to take such action and (2) describe the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) provided such notice to Parent at
least four (4) Business Days prior to taking any such action and (C) if
requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent during such four (4)
Business Day period regarding revisions to this Agreement which would permit
the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event; and

(iii) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written proposal capable
of being accepted to amend the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the
Financing Letters, within four (4) Business Days after receipt of such
notice, the board of directors of the Company shall have in good faith
determined (after consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering
the terms of such proposal by Parent, that the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company under applicable
Law.

(g) The Company agrees that any breach or violation of, or non-compliance
with, this Section 4.2 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9,
Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, or from
making any disclosures to the holders of Company Common Stock if the board of
directors of the Company in good faith determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (including any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the
board of directors of the Company expressly reaffirms its recommendation to
the Companys stockholders to vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
in such disclosure.

 



49 Section 4.3 _Meeting of the Company s Stockholders_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following the date of
this Agreement), the Company shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") with respect to a meeting of holders of Company Common
Stock to be held for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "); and (ii) in consultation
with Parent, set a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and
commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in
connection therewith. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC and the Company shall consider in good faith any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and it counsel. Parent shall furnish to
the Company all information regarding Parent and its Affiliates that may be
required (pursuant to the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws) to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC. The Company
shall (to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws): (x)
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and (y) take all steps necessary to cause
the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
shall promptly provide Parent and its counsel with a copy of any comments
received by the Company from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the response to any comment letter and any amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably proposed
by Parent and its counsel.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC or its staff advises
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company
may commence mailing the Proxy Statement, the Company shall (subject to
applicable Laws, rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the requirements of the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws) take all action
reasonably necessary to convene the Company Stockholders Meeting and to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may, after consultation with and prior written approval of Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), delay convening,
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting if the Company determines
in good faith that the delay, postponement or adjournment of the Company
Stockholders Meeting is necessary or appropriate in order to obtain sufficient
votes to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or, with respect to
disclosure matters, is required by the Company to comply with applicable Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.3(b) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other Person of any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Change of Recommendation.

 



50 (c) Subject to Section 4.2 and Section 4.3, (i) the board of directors of the
Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and
(ii) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval.

effected by it pursuant to Healthcare Laws (and other applicable Laws with
respect to the Merger) to take all actions necessary to initiate obtaining

(iv) take or cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary
or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the

or Section 4.4(c), each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties a

faith the views of the other parties and their counsel in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion,
proposal or other document made or submitted in connection with any
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding under or relating to (x) the HSR
Act or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust, competition or fair
trade law, (y) any Law enforced or administered by any Governmental Entity or
(z) the Required Approvals. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such investigation,
action, request for approval or Legal Proceeding, each party hereto will
permit authorized representatives and counsel of the other parties to be
present at each substantive meeting or conference relating to such
investigation, action, request for approval or Legal Proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any substantive document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such investigation, action, request for approval or Legal
Proceeding. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 4.4(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in Section 4.4(a) or
Section 4.4(b), Parent and Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken the
following actions: (i) the prompt use of reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (ii) the prompt use of reasonable best efforts, in the
event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable or threatened to be entered or issued, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to resist,
vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such
actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree so as to permit such consummation on the schedule
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to (x) institute any Legal
Proceedings against any Governmental Entity or (y) undertake any efforts or
to take any action if the taking of such efforts or action is or would
reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
material and adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, business, results of
operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries,

 



52  taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each of
such actions, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "); and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall take any action that has the effect of, or agree
with any Governmental Entity to, any Burdensome Condition without the prior
written consent of Parent.

(d) Nothing in this Section 4.4 shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company to take any action that is not conditioned on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Entities shall use commercially

bargaining in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Sub to implement certain transactions among the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including liquidations, conversions and mergers, as determined by Parent, the
consummation of which would occur on the Closing Date, immediately prior to
the Closing (any such transaction, a " _Pre-Acquisition Reorganization_ ");
_provided_ , that any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall (i) not
impede, delay or prevent consummation of the Merger (including by giving rise
to litigation by third parties), (ii) be structured so as not to prejudice,
in the reasonable opinion of the Company, the interests of any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company
Restricted Stock, (iii) not require the Company to obtain the approval
of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, (iv) not be considered in
determining whether a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
hereunder has been breached, (v) not be structured to require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action in contravention of any Law or

Merger Sub are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing and providing
any other evidence reasonably requested by the Company that the Closing will
occur (it being understood that in any event the Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization will be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the
Closing), and (vii) not be effective prior to the Closing Date, and then only
if it is reasonably certain, in the Companys reasonable judgment, that the
Merger will become effective that same day, and that such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization can be reversed or unwound without adversely affecting the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective operations, properties and
assets, in the event the Merger does not become effective and this Agreement
is terminated. Parent acknowledges and agrees that (x) any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization or related actions could require the consent of
third parties or Governmental Authorities, and the Company shall be under no
obligation to seek or pay any value to obtain such consents, and (y) the
completion of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization or related actions shall not
be a condition to consummation of the Merger. Parent shall, concurrently upon
request by the Company, forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out of pocket fees and expenses (including any reasonable and
documented out of pocket professional fees and expenses) incurred, directly or
indirectly, by the Company and its Subsidiaries in considering and cooperating
with Parent in connection with any request to effect a Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization, shall be responsible for all reasonable and documented out of
pocket fees and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in reversing or
unwinding (in the event this Agreement is terminated) any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization that was effected, and shall

 



53  indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives for and against any and all reasonable and
documented out of pocket losses and liabilities (including Taxes) suffered or
incurred by them, directly or indirectly, in connection with, or as a result
of any action taken pursuant to, this Section 4.4(f). The obligation of Parent

any reasonable and documented out of pocket losses and liabilities (including
Taxes) suffered or incurred by them, directly or indirectly, in connection
with, or as a result of any action taken pursuant to, this Section 4.4(f) will
be in addition to any other payment Parent may be obligated to make pursuant
to this Agreement and will survive termination of this Agreement.

 

(g) Without in any way limiting any partys rights or obligations under this
Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i) nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

Section 4.5 _Access_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford
Parents officers and other authorized representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to the Acquired Entities properties, books and records, and personnel
(including reasonable access to the Real Property and the buildings,
structures, fixtures, appurtenances and Improvements thereon to conduct an
investigation with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, legal and environmental compliance with respect to the Real
Property and the environmental condition of the Real Property), and, during
such period, the Company shall cause to be furnished or made available
promptly to Parent all readily available information concerning its business
as Parent may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would: (i) result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
obligation of any of the Acquired Entities with respect to confidentiality (
_provided_ , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the required consent of such third party to provide such access or
disclosure); (ii) jeopardize protections afforded any of the Acquired Entities
under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine (
_provided_ , that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (iii) include information
that identifies specific customers or other confidential information with
respect to any specific customer relationship to the extent such disclosure
is prohibited by applicable Laws ( _provided_ , that in the case that any such
access or disclosure is limited for the reasons described in clause (i)
through (iii), Parent and the Company each agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to establish a process that (through use of steps such as
targeted redactions, provision of information to counsel to review and
summarize for Parent or use of a "clean room" environment for analysis and
review of information by joint integration teams in coordination with counsel
and the Company) will provide Parent with timely access to the fullest extent
possible to the substance of the information described in this Section 4.5).
In addition, the Company shall (x) periodically deliver or make available to
Parent written notice of any pending (or, to the

 



54  Knowledge of the Company, threatened) Legal Proceeding and updates to the
material Legal Proceedings set forth on Section 2.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (y) promptly deliver or make available to Parent
copies of (A) any amendments, modifications, waivers or notices of default or
termination, with respect to the Real Estate Leases and (B) any complaints,
answers, pleadings, filings or correspondence regarding any current or future
proceedings, litigation or administrative actions, affecting any Facility, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All information obtained by Parent and its
Representatives pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be treated as
"Confidential Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 4.6  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party hereto shall give
prompt notice to the other parties of the discovery by such party of: (a) any
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of any party hereto that would
make the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.3(a) incapable
of being satisfied or (b) any failure on the part of any party hereto to
comply with any of its covenants contained in this Agreement that would make
the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(b) incapable of
being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder. In addition,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries entry into or material amendment or termination prior to the
expiration of the existing term of any Material Contract set forth on Section
2.10(a)(ii) to which the Company or any such Subsidiary is a party.

Section 4.7 _Publicity_. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter, except with respect to any Change of Recommendation or other
action taken by the Company pursuant to Section 4.2, the Company and Parent
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, any press releases or other
public statements or statements to employees with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or filings with any Governmental Entity

public statement made in connection with any dispute between the parties
hereto regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will, and Parent
will cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of the Acquired Entities pursuant to: (i) each
indemnification agreement in effect between any of the Acquired Entities and
any Indemnified Party as set forth in Section 4.8(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and (ii) any indemnification provision, expense
advancement provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents
of the Acquired Entities as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company

 



55  and equivalent organizational documents of the Surviving Companys
Subsidiaries shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification,
expense advancement and exculpation from liability at least as favorable as
the indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation from liability
provisions set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and equivalent organizational documents of the Companys relevant
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and, during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any Indemnified Party.

(b) Through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company will maintain, and Parent shall cause to be maintained, in effect, for
the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of
directors and officers liability insurance coverage as set forth in the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (i) in no event shall Parent be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable
by the Company with respect to such current policy (the " _Annual Cap_ "), it
being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceed the Annual Cap, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to the Annual Cap; and
(ii) in lieu of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in
clause (i) above, the Company in consultation with Parent may obtain a prepaid
"tail" policy prior to the Effective Time that provides the Indemnified
Parties with directors and officers liability insurance for a period ending
no earlier than the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time; _provided_
, that the cost per annum of such "tail" policy shall be subject to the
Annual Cap.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Company (or Parent)
set forth in this Section 4.8.

(d) The Indemnified Parties are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 4.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 4.8 shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the relevant certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at
law or in equity).

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 4.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



56 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, each Person who is or was an officer or
director of any of the Acquired Entities at or at any time prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnified Party_."

Section 4.9 _Financing_.

(a) (i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) described in the Financing Letters pursuant to the terms thereof
and satisfy the conditions to the Financing as described in the Financing
Letters (including the repayment of any indebtedness to the extent such
repayment is a condition to the Financing) and shall not permit any
termination, amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision under, or any replacement of, any of the Financing Letters or any
fee or other letter or agreement relating thereto if such termination,
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount) to the extent that Parent would not be able
to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate Option
Consideration, the aggregate Company RSU Consideration and all fees, expenses
and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Company on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement or (B)
imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any of the conditions to the receipt of Financing, or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing Letters, in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent or make less likely
the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto;
_provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may amend any of the Financing Letters
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed such Financing Letters as of the date of this
Agreement to the extent that the commitments of any of the Lead Lenders to
provide all of the Financing are not terminated or reduced as a result of any
such amendment. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any of the
Financing Letters or of any fee or other letter or agreement relating thereto
(redacted as in the case of such fee or other agreement in a manner
contemplated by Section 3.6). Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to, subject to provision by the Company of the Required Information,
cause the Marketing Period to commence on or before July 16, 2012.

 

(ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts (A) to
maintain in effect each of the Financing Letters, (B) to, as soon as
practicable, negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
each of the Financing Letters with, subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 4.9(a)(i), the conditions to funding contained in the Financing
Letters and on the terms (including the flex provisions) contained in the
Financing Letters (or as to terms that are not directly or indirectly related
to any condition to closing or the availability of the Financing on other
terms acceptable to Parent, Merger Sub and the Lead Lenders), (C) to satisfy
on a timely

 



57  basis all conditions to receipt of the Financing at the Closing set forth
therein that are within its control (other than any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to
furnish required and requested information described in Section 4.9(b)) and,
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters, to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Lead Lenders and the other persons
committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at the Closing, and (D)
to comply with its obligations, including the payment of any and all
commitment or other fees and expenses in a timely manner that become payable,
under each of the Financing Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on
a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice, (x) of any breach
or default by any party to any of the Financing Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become
aware, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of any of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (2)
material dispute or disagreement relating to the Financing, including
with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at Closing, and (z) if at any time for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing. If any portion of the Financing otherwise
becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate Option Consideration, the
aggregate Company RSU Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts
contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company
pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts, at their sole expense, to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable, alternative financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with terms and conditions, taken as a whole,
not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates), including
conditions to closing not less favorable to the Company and its Affiliates,
than the terms and conditions set forth in each of the Financing Letters.
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
contracts pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide any portion of the Financing and all other fee and other agreements
related thereto (redacted as in the case of such fee or other agreement in a
manner contemplated by Section 3.6). For purposes of this Section 4.9 and
Section 3.6, references to "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Term Loan Financing Letter and the ABL Financing Letter,
as permitted by this Section 4.9 to be amended, modified or replaced, and
references to "Financing Letter" or "Financing Letters" shall include, as the
case may be, such documents as permitted by this Section 4.9 to be amended,
modified or replaced, in each case from and after such amendment,
modification and replacement.

 



58 (b) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary or reasonably desirable in
connection with Parents and Merger Subs efforts to obtain the Financing or
any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing
(collectively with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ ") ( _provided_
, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) (A)

consummated, including financial information and data reasonably necessary to
satisfy the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters in effect on the
date hereof and as may be reasonably requested by Parent (the information,
data, financial statements, pro forma financial statements and other financial

Section 4.9(b) that has been requested in writing in accordance thereof shall
mean the " _Required Information_ "), (iii) participating in a reasonable
number of meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions at times and

seniority and expertise, of the Company), and reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources, in
each case in connection with the Available Financing, (iv) assisting with the

and that are required to be obtained under the Financing Letters at Closing;
_provided_ , that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

or Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other liability, cost or expense that is not simultaneously
reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Available Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its

lenders of the applicable Payoff Amount and the replacement (or cash
collateralization or backstopping) of any then outstanding letters of credit
of the Company, to the extent agreed by the Companys lenders, under the
Credit Agreement.

 

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
obtaining the Financing nor obtaining any Available Financing is a condition
to the consummation of the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives shall not, prior to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby at Closing, have any responsibility for, or incur any
liability to any person under, any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 4.9 (other than, in the
case of the Company, liability to Parent for breach of the Companys
obligations under Section 4.9(b)) and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any
of them as a result of any action against any of such parties arising out
of (A) the arrangement of the Financing or any Available Financing, (B) the
information used in connection therewith and (C) any acts performed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries under this Section 4.9 including at Parents
or Merger Subs request under this Section 4.9.

director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Section 4.11 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by
each director of the Company and its Subsidiaries in office immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than with respect to any directors identified by

Date), which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time.

 



61 Section 4.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any
stockholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened in writing, against the Company and/or the members
of the board of directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such stockholder litigation
brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against
the Company and/or members of the board of directors of the Company and shall

the other parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , that such delisting and termination shall

Section 4.14 _Takeover Statute_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions," or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state
antitakeover Law or regulation becomes, or purports to become, applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.15 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit
accrual) for service with the Acquired Entity (or predecessor employers to the
extent the Acquired Entity provides such past service credit under its
employee benefit plans) under each of the comparable employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Company or the relevant
Subsidiary, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes a
participant, except in each case to the extent such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits. With respect to each health or welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or the relevant Subsidiary
for the benefit of any Continuing Employees, Parent shall (i) cause to be
waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such plan, to the extent waived or satisfied under the comparable
Company Plan and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under
such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar
Company Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or the relevant
Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

 



62 (b) Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Company
or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular employee of
an Acquired Entity following the Closing Date, (ii) shall be construed to
prohibit Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating any Company Plan, or (iii) shall require Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries to take any action reasonably
believed to be in violation of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
No provision of this Agreement shall (x) create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee or any beneficiary or dependents thereof with respect
to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may
be provided, or (y) be construed as in any way modifying or amending the
provisions of any Company Plan.

Section 4.16 _Equity Contributions_. If upon the consummation of the Closing
(a) Parent would not be in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant
contained in Section 10.1 of the TNW Guaranty (the " _TNW Covenant_ "), and
(b) such non-compliance has not been waived in writing by the landlords to
the TNW Lease, which landlords are the beneficiaries of the TNW Guaranty,
Parent shall obtain, on or prior to the Closing Date, one or more equity
contributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000), to the extent such equity contributions would result in Parent
being in compliance with the TNW Covenant upon the consummation of the
Closing.

_CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER_

 

Section 5.1 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_. The

following conditions:

 

(a) _Stockholder Approval_. The Company shall have obtained the Company
Stockholder Approval;

 

(b) _HSR Act_. Any waiting period (and any extension of such period) under the
HSR Act applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall

(c) _Other Governmental Approvals_. The approvals of the Merger from the
federal and state regulatory agencies (or equivalent or successor agencies
thereof) that are set forth in Section 5.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each an " _Agency_ ") shall have been obtained (the " _Required
Approvals_ "). This condition shall be deemed satisfied upon the occurrence of
any one of the following events (each an " _Approval Event_ ") in response to
the notifications and filings provided to such Agency pursuant to Section
4.4(a) and any subsequent filings (the " _CHOW Notices_ "): (i) the receipt of
confirmation in writing, which may be in the form of an electronic message, or
verbally (if confirmed in a writing to the Agency) that the parties are
authorized by the Agency to proceed with the Merger on the terms outlined in
the CHOW Notice submitted to the Agency or (ii) the failure of such Agency to
advise one or more of the parties in writing or verbally (if confirmed in a
writing to the Agency) by October 31, 2012 (and for the avoidance of doubt,
the condition contained in this Section 5.1(c) shall not be capable of
satisfaction with respect to a particular Agency pursuant to this clause (ii)

will be issued by such Agency to one or more of the parties in connection with
the consummation of the Merger or (B) notice to or informational filings are
required or permitted to be made by one or more of the parties with

change in applicable Laws occurs that has the effect of requiring formal or
additional filings before authorization to proceed with the Merger will be

this Section 5.1(c) was previously believed to be satisfied pursuant to clause
(ii) above notifies one or more of the parties verbally (if confirmed in a
writing to the Agency) or in writing that the certificate of need, licensure,
Medicare or Medicaid approval, as applicable, is required for the
authorization of the Merger or that the matter is under further consideration
or review. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time
after October 31, 2012, the Required Approvals have all been obtained except
with respect to three or fewer of the Facilities so long as (1) each such
Facility is not located in a state where more than three Facilities (such
term, in this case only, inclusive of Facilities owned, leased or managed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) are located, and (2) no Parent Related
Party may be held criminally liable for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without any such Required Approval (taking
into account whether any such criminal liability could be avoided if the
parties close the applicable Facility on or before the Closing and provided
that if the applicable Facility must be closed prior to the Closing in order
to avoid criminal liability, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including Section 4.1), the Company may take all actions
reasonably necessary to close or transfer such Facility and Parent and Merger
Sub shall not be required to complete the Closing until the first to occur of
(Q) such Facility has been transferred or closed, (R) the Required Approval
for such Facility is otherwise obtained or (S) the applicable Agency agrees
in writing that the closing or transfer of such Facility can occur post-
Closing), then the condition contained in this Section 5.1(c) will be deemed
to be fully satisfied irrespective of the failure to obtain such
Required Approvals; and

(d) _Statutes and Injunctions_. No (i) temporary restraining order or
preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order by any federal or state
court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction preventing consummation of
the Merger shall be in effect, (ii) applicable Law prohibiting consummation of
the Merger shall be in effect, and (iii) Governmental Entity shall have
instituted any action, claim, suit or proceeding (which remains pending at
what otherwise would be the Closing Date) seeking to enjoin, restrain or
otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger.

breached) to Parent of more than $100,000 in the aggregate) and (iii) each of
the other representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement shall be accurate in all respects (read, for purposes of this

date, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been accurate
in all respects as of such date), except that any inaccuracies in such

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect;

determined that no such Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as of
the Closing Date, and providing as an attachment to such certificate, the
basis for the Companys determination; (ii) the Company shall have provided a
draft of such certificate to Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to

have provided such additional supporting documentation as Parent shall
reasonably request evidencing the Companys determination to the extent
that such additional documentation can reasonably be provided by the Company
within four (4) Business Days after the Company provided Parent with such

under the Master Lease Intercreditor Agreements, or cause the amendment of
the Master Lease Intercreditor Agreements.

Closing Date as if made as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any
such representation or warranty speaks as of the date of this Agreement or
any other specific date, in which case such representation or warranty shall
have been accurate in all respects as of such date), except that any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties will be disregarded for
purposes of this Section 5.3(a) if such inaccuracies (considered collectively)

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) shall not be

(i)(A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 6.1(d), (B) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal has been publicly

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

As used herein, " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to $6,900,000.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated, other than pursuant to Section 6.1(a),
Section 6.1(b), Section 6.1(c), Section 6.1(d) (in the context where no

immediately available funds equal to $20,000,000.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in

enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 6.3, and,
in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences an action which results in a judgment against the other party for
the payment set forth in this Section 6.3, such paying party shall pay the
other party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the payment set forth in this Section 6.3 at
the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
becomes obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section
6.3, Parent agrees that its right to receive the Company Termination Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current, former or future
Affiliates and (ii) the current, former or future directors, officers, general
or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons,
employees, representatives or agents of any of the Persons listed in
the foregoing clause (i) for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated; and upon payment of such fee, none of
the foregoing shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in respect of any other agreement, document or theory of law or
equity.

 



71 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 

(i) if Parent becomes obligated to pay the Financing Termination Fee pursuant

Financing Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company against (A) Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources and any of their
respective current, former or future Affiliates and (B) the current, former
or future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, employees, representatives or agents
of any of the Persons listed in the foregoing clause (A) (the Persons listed
in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the " _Parent Related_
_Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated; and upon payment of such fee, no
Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in respect of any other agreement, document or theory of law or
equity;

(ii) except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach (subject to Section
6.3(f)(i)), in connection with any loss suffered as a result of any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
failure of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, the Company agrees that the maximum aggregate
liability of the Parent Related Parties shall not exceed an amount equal to
the Financing Termination Fee (inclusive of any payment of the
Financing Termination Fee), and in no event shall the Company seek to recover
any monetary damages in excess of such amount (including consequential,
indirect or punitive damages); and

 

(iii) this Agreement may only be enforced by the Company against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be made by the Company against, the entities that are
expressly identified as parties hereto, and no Parent Related Party
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to
this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the Company
against Parent or Merger Sub (including the Companys rights under Section
7.6), in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Company
agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or
seek to recover monetary damages from, any other Parent Related Party.

(g) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree on behalf of themselves and their
Affiliates that the Company Termination Fee and Financing Termination Fee are
not penalties, but rather, if actually received by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, are liquidated

 



72  damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company,
as applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or
the Financing Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunity forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
