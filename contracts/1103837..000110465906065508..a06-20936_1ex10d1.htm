Sellers agree to make available to Buyer from time to time, and upon Buyers
reasonable request therefor, all agreements, assignments and other documents
relating to the Company or the Company Assets still in the possession of
Sellers as Buyer may reasonably require for the purpose of responding to or

Assets, determining whether payments under Company License Agreements have
been inadvertently made to Seller as contemplated by Section 6.14 and for any
other reason which Seller reasonably believes warrants access to such
agreements, assignments and other documents.

  

## 6.10 _No Additional Representations_. Buyer acknowledges that it and its
representatives have received access to such books and records, facilities,

## 

  

### and on a "where is" basis, except as expressly represented or warranted
in this Agreement (which includes the Schedules hereto); (b) neither Seller
nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company or the Company Assets furnished or made available to Buyer and its
representatives except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (which
includes the Schedules hereto) and (c) except as contemplated hereby, neither

representations and warranties set forth herein, Seller makes
no representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to (x) the information

not included in the Confidential Memorandum.

  

## 6.11 _Tax Matters_.

  

### (a) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such assistance and information as may reasonably be
requested by each of them in connection with (i) the preparation of any Tax
Returns required to be filed (x) by the Company and its Subsidiaries (or with
respect to the income, properties or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or (y) with respect to ownership interests of the Company and
(ii) any audit or other examination by any Tax authority or any judicial
or administrative proceedings relating to such Tax Returns. Seller, Buyer and
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall retain for the
full period of any statute of limitations (including any extensions) all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material records and other
documents relating to Tax matters, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods, and shall provide to each
other, any records or information reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation of such Tax Returns or any audit, examination or proceeding
relating to such Tax Returns.

  

### (b) _Tax Returns_. (i) Seller shall prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed) in a timely manner all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and with respect to the income, properties or operations of the

Tax Returns that are due after the Closing Date. Seller shall prepare such Tax
Returns, and each item thereon shall be treated, in a manner consistent with
past practices employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, as appropriate,
unless otherwise required by law, and Buyer shall have the right to review
and comment on such Tax Returns in a reasonable manner; provided, however,
that for the avoidance of doubt the foregoing shall not apply to any Tax
Returns of Sellers Affiliated Group. (ii) Buyer shall prepare and file (or
cause to be prepared and filed) in a timely manner all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (and with respect to
the income, properties or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,

Seller or Sellers Affiliated Group) for any Pre-Closing Period that are due
after the

     

   

### 

  

### Closing Date and for any Straddle Period. The rest of this Section
6.11(b)(ii) shall apply only if Seller is at least partially liable for
payment of Taxes shown on such Tax Returns (and Buyer requests payment of
such Taxes from Seller) under provisions of Section 6.11(c).  Buyer shall
prepare such Tax Returns, and each item thereon shall be treated, in a manner
consistent with past practices employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as appropriate, unless otherwise required by law or such past practice is
unreasonable. Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such completed Tax
Return (and, in the case of any Tax Return for a Straddle Period, a statement
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to
Seller in accordance with Section 6.11(g) hereof), together with appropriate
supporting information and schedules, at least 20 business days prior to the
due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return.
Seller shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior
to the filing thereof. In the case of any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing
Period, Buyer shall make any changes reasonably requested by Seller with
respect to any such Tax Return. No Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period shall
be filed without Sellers prior written approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (iii) Buyer shall prepare
and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) in a timely manner all Tax
Returns of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (and with respect to the
income, properties or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) for any
Post-Closing Period.

  

### (c) _Tax Payments_. (i) Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the
relevant Tax authority all Taxes shown on Tax Returns required to be filed by
Seller pursuant to Section 6.11(b)(i) hereof on or prior to the due date for
payment thereof.  (ii) Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the relevant
Tax authority all Taxes shown on Tax Returns required to be filed by Buyer
pursuant to Section 6.11(b)(ii) hereof on or prior to the due date for
payment thereof. Seller shall remit to Buyer (x) the amount of such Taxes,
in the case of Pre-Closing Periods or (y) the portion of such Taxes that is
allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 6.11(g) hereof, in the case of Straddle Periods.
Payment of such amounts shall be made to Buyer in immediately available funds
at least two business days before the date on which such Taxes are due.

  

### (d) _Tax Indemnity_. Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold the
Indemnified Buyers and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries harmless from
and against any Losses with respect to (i) Taxes of or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which any of them may be liable,
for any Pre-Closing Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date), (ii) Taxes of or which are the liability of Seller or of any
of the members of Sellers Affiliated Group (for which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries may become liable under Treasury Regulations §1.1502-6 or
otherwise), and (iii) any Taxes imposed on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries arising as a result of a breach or violation of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 (Taxes) and/or
the covenants contained in Section 6.11 (Tax Matters), in each case together
with reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys and accountants fees and, in each
case, without duplication of amounts previously paid by Seller pursuant to
Section 6.11(c)(i) in each case, excluding Losses for Taxes relating to Sale
and Leaseback Transactions. Indemnity payments under this Section 6.11(d)
shall be made to Buyer in immediately available funds at least two business
days before the date payment of the Taxes to which such payment relates is
due, or, if such Tax has been paid by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, within
ten days after written demand is made for such payment, and shall not be
subject to any minimum threshold or maximum limit.

     

   



  

### (e) _Tax Refunds/Benefits_. Any credit which has the result of reducing
the Tax payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Post-Closing
Period and any Tax credit or refund (including any interest with respect
thereto), in each case relating to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) and to the extent Seller is liable for or has made payment of
Tax giving rise to such credit pursuant to Section 6.11(c) hereof, shall be
the property of Seller, and if received by Buyer, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries shall be payable promptly to Seller (other than any credit or
Tax refund that arises out of the carry back of a loss or credit incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Post-Closing Period). Any other
Tax refund or credit shall be the property of Buyer.

  

### (f) _Contests_. (i) After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
in writing of (x) any correspondence from any Tax authority relating to any
Tax Return filed by Seller pursuant to Section 6.11(b)(i) or by Buyer
pursuant to Section 6.11(b)(ii) and (y) any written notice of a
proposed assessment or claim in an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (clauses (x) and (y)
together, a " _Tax Contest_ ") which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification by Seller (including any
payment under Section 6.11(c)). (ii) In the case of a Tax Contest that
relates to a Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall have the right at its expense
to control the conduct of such Tax Contest; provided that (x) Seller shall
indemnify the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of all third-
party costs and expenses incurred by such Company or any such Subsidiary at
Sellers request in connection with such Tax Contest, (y) Seller shall
keep Buyer informed of all material progress (and shall send Buyer copies of
all material correspondence relating thereto) of the Tax Contest and (z)
Seller shall not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim
pursuant to such Tax Contest with respect to any issue that recurs for any
Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period or any item resulting in a reciprocal
adjustment to any Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Buyer also may participate at its own expense in
any such Tax Contest and, if Seller does not notify Buyer in writing within
30 days of receiving notice of such Tax Contest pursuant to Section
6.11(f)(i) hereof of its intent to assume the defense of such Tax Contest,
Buyer may defend the same in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such Tax Contest after
giving five days prior written notice to Seller setting forth the terms and
conditions of settlement. (iii) In the case of a Tax Contest that relates to
a Straddle Period, (x) each of Seller and Buyer may participate in the Tax
Contest, and (y) the Tax Contest shall be controlled by that party which
would bear the burden of the greater portion of the adjustment (the "
_Controlling Party_ "); provided that (a) the Controlling Party
shall indemnify the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of all third-party
costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any such Subsidiary at the
Controlling Partys request in connection with such Tax Contest, (b) the
Controlling Party shall keep the other party informed of all material
progress (and shall send such party copies of all material correspondence
relating thereto) of the Tax Contest and (c) if Seller is the Controlling
Party, Seller shall not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any
claim pursuant to such Tax Contest with respect to any issue that recurs for
any Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period or any item resulting in a
reciprocal adjustment to any Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period without
the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The principle set forth in clause (y) of
the preceding sentence also shall govern for purposes of deciding any issue
that must be decided

     

   

### 

  

### jointly (in particular, choice of judicial forum) in situations in which
separate issues are otherwise controlled hereunder by Buyer and Seller. (iv)
In the case of a Tax Contest that relates to a Post-Closing Period, Buyer
shall have the right at its expense to control the conduct of such Tax
Contest. (v) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) above, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant
to any Tax Contest which would adversely affect the other party for such year
or a subsequent year, or which would result in a payment under Section
6.11(d), without the written consent of the other party, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld.  Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate, and Buyer
agrees to cause the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the
defense against or compromise of any claim in any Tax Contest.

  

### (g) _Allocation of Tax for Straddle Periods_. With respect to any Tax
that is payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such
Tax allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall
be deemed to equal: (i) in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related
to income or receipts, the amount that would be payable if the taxable year
ended with the Closing Date (giving effect to any Tax credit or net operating
loss carryover available as of the Closing Date), and (ii) in the case of all
other Tax, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending with the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

  

### (h) _Tax Returns of Seller s Affiliated Group_.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, (i) Sellers Affiliated Group shall be
entitled to control in all respects, and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Contest or other Tax
proceeding with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return
that includes any member of Sellers Affiliated Group and (ii) no member of
Sellers Affiliated Group shall be required to provide any person with any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return or copy thereof that includes
any member of Sellers Affiliated Group (provided, however, that to the
extent that such Tax Returns would be required to be delivered but for this
Section 6.11(h), the person that would be required to deliver such
Tax Returns shall instead deliver pro forma Tax Returns relating solely to
the Company or its relevant Subsidiary).

  

### (i) _Termination of Any Tax Sharing Agreement_. Any and all tax
allocation or sharing agreements or other arrangements for the sharing of
taxes between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Seller and/or any member of the Sellers Affiliated Group, on the other
hand, shall terminate as of, or prior to, the Closing Date and the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or Buyer shall have no obligation to pay
to the Seller and/or any member of the Sellers Affiliated Group any amount
relating to taxes under any such agreement or arrangement.

  

## 6.12 _Participations and Residuals_. (a) Buyer shall, or shall cause
Servicing Agent to, provide Seller, or its designee, with all sales data,
payee information and other information required to enable Seller to
discharge the Participations and Residuals, in each case, within a reasonable
time period after receipt by Servicing Agent of all information required from
film exhibitors, licensees and other third parties. Seller shall discharge
each of the Participations and Residuals promptly following receipt from
Buyer of all sales data, payee information and other information with respect
to such Participations and Residuals.  Buyer shall provide

     

   

## 

  

### reasonable access to Buyers and the Companys employees, books and
records and other relevant information required to enable Seller to discharge
promptly when due the Participations and Residuals. The information provided
by Buyer shall include, but not be limited to (i) the relevant information
for all license agreements and other contracts entered into by Buyer or the
Company following the Closing relating to the Film Rights, (ii) the
revenues received by Buyer, the Company and their licenses from Exploitation
of the Film Rights, (iii) the number of exhibitions of any Film, (iv) the
Media and territories in which the licensed Exploitation has taken place, (v)
any discussions or agreements with any creative artist or Guild in respect of
any Film Rights, and (vi) any other information required for calculation
of residuals and participations under applicable Guild agreements and the
Film Agreements. For avoidance of doubt, no party hereunder shall have any
obligations under this Section 6.12 for any Participations and Residuals that
become due and payable as a result of events occurring after the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the Closing.

  

### (b) In the event and at the time that the Films hereunder are sold or
licensed by the Company or its agents in transactions involving other films
or programs (a "film package"), Buyer shall in good faith ensure that any
license revenues allocated to any Films in a film package are reasonably and
fairly based on the relative value of the Films in relation to the other
films or programs in the film package. Buyer shall give Seller
prompt written notice of any claim for such participation and residual costs
to enable Seller to defend, dispute or mitigate such residual costs at its
option and in its sole discretion.

  

### (c) Buyer shall, effective as of the business day following the tenth
anniversary of the Closing Date, enter into the Guild Assumption Agreements
in a form consistent with industry standards and sufficient to fully
terminate and discharge Sellers obligations and liability for any
Participations and Residuals that become due and payable as a result of
events occurring after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date under
any Guild Assumption Agreements Seller has entered into with respect to any
Exploitation of or revenues received from the Company Assets.

  

## 6.13 _Additional Obligations Related to Participations and Receivables_.
(a)  After the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Servicing Agent to
provide the following to Seller with respect to Participations and Residuals:
(i) with respect to the profit participations referred to in clause (i) of
the definition of Participations and Residuals, (A) a list of Film titles
subject to participation rights, and (B) with respect to each such Film the
formula or formulas for calculating the profit participations; and (ii) with
respect to the residual payment obligations referred to in clause (ii) of the
definition of Participations and Residuals, on a Film-by-Film basis, the
formula or formulas for calculating the residual payment obligation to each
Guild in connection with the exhibition of such Film.  Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Servicing Agent to provide the
information referred to in this Section 6.13(a) within 45 days following the
Closing Date.

  

### (b) If Seller delivers a written notice to Buyer at any time prior to the
date on which Buyer or an Affiliate executes a Guild Assumption Agreement
that Seller is the subject of a potential transaction with an unaffiliated
third party involving a sale of all or substantially all of the capital stock
or assets of Seller (a " _Potential Change of Control_ "), Buyer shall,
within 30 days of Buyers receipt of such notice, deliver to Seller a
proposal for the termination of Sellers

     

   

### 

  

### obligations under Section 6.12 in connection with such Potential Change
of Control, which proposal shall include the price payable by Seller as
consideration for such termination. Thereafter, Buyer will negotiate in
good faith to reach an agreement with Seller with respect to such
termination; provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to agree to any such
termination on any terms unless and until a definitive agreement is reached
between Buyer and Seller with respect to such a termination.  Buyer agrees
to keep confidential information regarding a Potential Change of Control
communicated to it by Seller, subject to the same exceptions to confidential
treatment of "Evaluation Information" set forth in paragraphs 1 and 4 of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### (c) Service Agent has or shall submit to Entertainment Partners the
information attached hereto as Schedule 6.13(c), which is intended to provide
the information necessary for Entertainment Partners to determine residual
payments due to creative artists or Guilds on account of the Exploitation of
the Film Rights (except for payments due in connection with music licensing
contemplated in Section 4.14(a)) as of September 20, 2006.  Seller agrees
that this Section 6.13(c) shall not be construed to limit Sellers obligation
to indemnify Buyer for any Retained Liability in accordance with Article IX.

  

## 6.14 _Program License Agreements Payments_.  Schedule 6.14 sets forth the
amounts due and payable by Seller or its Affiliates to RHI Entertainment
Distribution, LLC under the Program License Agreements as of September 30,
2006.  Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good faith to amend Schedule
6.14 prior to the Closing Date to add such additional amounts that become due
and payable under the Program License Agreements during the period from
September 30, 2006 through the Closing Date, it being understood that any
good faith disputes as to such amounts shall be resolved after the Closing
Date in accordance with the terms of the Program License Agreements.

") which may be incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Buyers or any of
them, arising out of or relating to (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by Seller or the Company in this Agreement; (b) any failure on
the part of Seller to perform any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
on the part of the Company with respect to covenants required to be performed
prior to the Closing; or (c) any Retained Liabilities (each, a " _Seller s
Indemnification Claim_"). Save in the case of fraud, including,
without limitation, fraudulent concealment by Seller, in no event shall
Seller have any liability with respect to any indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) (except in the case of any breach of Section 4.3 (No
Undisclosed Liabilities), Section 4.10 (Taxes) or Section 4.19 (Ownership by
the Company; No Inconsistent Actions)) until the total dollar amount of all
such indemnification obligations that would otherwise be identifiable
pursuant to such Section 9.1(a) (other than Losses arising from breaches of
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3 (No Undisclosed
Liabilities), Section 4.10 (Taxes) or Section 4.19 (Ownership by the Company;
No Inconsistent Actions)), shall exceed $1,600,000, in which event Seller
will be liable only for the amount in excess of $1,600,000; _provided_ that
(save in the case of fraud, including, without limitation, fraudulent
concealment by Seller) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability in
respect of Section 9.1(a) (except in the case of any breach of Section 4.3
(No Undisclosed Liabilities), Section 4.10 (Taxes) or Section 4.19 (Ownership
by the Company; No Inconsistent Actions)) exceed $25,000,000, provided that
the foregoing limits on the Sellers liability shall not apply with respect
to Losses arising from breaches of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.3 (No Undisclosed Liabilities), Section 4.10 (Taxes) or
Section 4.19 (Ownership by the Company; No Inconsistent Actions).

  

## 9.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold
Seller and its officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members,
employees, representatives, agents, attorneys, licensees, Affiliates and
assigns (the " _Indemnified Seller Parties_ ") harmless from and against any
and all Losses which may be sustained, incurred or suffered by
the Indemnified Seller Parties as a result of, arising out of or relating to
(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement, and (b) any failure on the part of Buyer to perform any covenant
or agreement in this Agreement. Save in the case of fraud, including,
without limitation, fraudulent concealment by Buyer, in no event shall Buyer
have any liability with respect to any indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2(a) in an amount exceeding $25,000,000.

     

   



  

## 9.3 _Defense of Claims_.

  

### (a) If any claim is brought against any of the indemnified parties by a
third party, and if such indemnified party intends to seek indemnity with
respect thereto under this Article 9, such indemnified party shall promptly
notify in writing Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of such claim. If any
indemnified party fails to provide the foregoing written notice in a timely
manner, which failure to notify results in or otherwise gives rise to any
material prejudice to the defense of such claim, the indemnified party or
parties shall be deemed to have waived its or their rights to indemnification
under this Article 9 from the indemnifying party or parties only to the
extent of the prejudice suffered as a result of failure to timely notify.

  

### (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party shall have 30
days to commence to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its
own choosing and its sole cost and expense, the settlement or defense
thereof, and the indemnified party shall cooperate in connection therewith
(including, without limitation, providing to the indemnifying party, at the
indemnifying partys request, and at no cost, any information and reasonable
assistance from the indemnified partys staff which may be necessary for such
settlement or defense); _provided_  that:

  

##### (i) without the indemnified partys consent, the indemnifying party
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that provides for the imposition of any Lien on any assets of the Company or
other assets of the indemnified party, or any injunctive or equitable relief
affecting the indemnified party;

  

##### (ii) the indemnifying party shall permit the indemnified party to
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the
indemnified party; _provided_  that the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by the indemnified party; and

  

##### (iii) the indemnifying party shall agree promptly to reimburse the
indemnified party for the full amount of any loss, damage or third party
costs incurred by the indemnified party as a result of such claim, but not
including any attorneys fees or expenses of the indemnified party when the
indemnifying party has assumed the defense and not including overhead or
personnel costs of the indemnified party arising from cooperating with the
indemnifying party; and so long as the indemnifying party is reasonably
contesting any such claim in good faith, the indemnified party shall not pay
or settle any claim. If the indemnifying party does not notify
the indemnified party within 30 days after receipt of the indemnified
partys written notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have the right to
contest, settle or compromise the claim at the expense of the indemnifying
party. The indemnified party shall, however, notify the indemnifying party
writing of any compromise or settlement of any such claim.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any claim by a third
party against any Indemnified Buyer with respect to Participations and
Residuals, Buyer shall be permitted (but not required) to pay (or cause to be
paid) the amount of such third party claim

     

   

### 

  

### prior to delivery of notice to Seller and without the requirement of
compliance with Section 9.3(b) if a hearing or other proceeding regarding
foreclosure of a Company Asset is scheduled to take place within ten (10)
days, and any amount paid to such third party shall constitute a Loss subject
to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(c). If Buyer shall make any
payments pursuant to this Section 9.3(c), Seller shall be subrogated to all
Buyers rights to contest the amount of such payment.

  

### (d) The foregoing provisions of Section 9.3 shall not apply to Tax
matters, which instead shall be governed by Section 6.11.

  

## 9.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.  All representations
and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of 36
months; _provided_ that the indemnification obligations of Section 9.1 (c)
and those of Section 9.1(a) with respect to Section 4.19 (Ownership by the
Company, No Inconsistent Actions) shall survive indefinitely, and those of
Section 9.1(a) with respect to Section 4.3 (No Undisclosed Liabilities) and
4.10 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until the 30 days after the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations with respect thereto; and _provided_
_further_ that all covenants in this Agreement shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms (or until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, if no term is specified). No claim may be brought
for breaches or alleged breaches of any representations or warranties after
the expiration of the survival period.

  

## 9.5 _No Limitation on Rights_.

  

### (a) Except as expressly limited herein, the rights of Buyer and Seller
set forth in this Article 9 shall be in addition to all other rights and
remedies which otherwise would be available to Buyer or Seller at law or in
equity.

  

### (b) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Article 9 shall be net of any amounts recovered by any indemnified party
from third parties (including without limitation amounts recovered under
insurance policies).

  

## 9.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The parties agree that, except as
required pursuant to a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code, any indemnity payments pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

## 9.7 _No Right of Contribution_. Seller shall have no right of
contribution against the Company with respect to the indemnification
obligations of Seller set forth in this Article 9.

  

 **ARTICLE 10**

  

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

## 10.1 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, Seller agrees to
execute and deliver to Buyer from time to time upon written request by Buyer
(at Sellers expense), such additional documents or instruments consistent
herewith and to perform such further acts as Buyer may reasonably require to
give to Buyer the full benefit of all of the provisions of this

     

   

## 

  

### Agreement (which shall include the transfer to Buyer of any Company
Assets not transferred  through the acquisition by Buyer of all right title
and interest in the Company). Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to send, on
or promptly following the Closing Date, notice letters (in a form to be
provided by Buyer) addressed from Seller to each licensee under the Company
License Agreements that inform such licensees of the change of control in
licensor and provide, as necessary, new contact information and payment
instructions. Seller agrees to remit to Buyer any payments under the Company
License Agreements received by it or any of its Affiliates after the Closing
Date.

  

## 10.2 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing, as follows:

  

### (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller duly authorized by
their respective boards of directors;

  

### (b) by either of Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 2006; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.2 shall not be available to
the party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before such date;

  

### (c) by either of Buyer or Seller if any order, injunction or decree
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
have been entered by any court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental
Entity and shall have become final and non-appealable;

  

### (d) by Buyer if (i) there shall have been a material breach of any
representation or warranty on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement
or if any material representation or warranty of Seller shall have become
untrue in either case such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a)
would be or might reasonably be expected to be incapable of being satisfied
by December 31, 2006 (and for the purposes of this clause, any information
provided by Seller pursuant to Section 6.11 shall be deemed not to qualify
the Sellers representations and warranties); (ii) there shall have been a
material breach or breaches by Seller of its covenants or agreements
hereunder such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) would be
incapable of being satisfied by December 31, 2006; or (iii) between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing there is any material adverse change in the
business, operations, assets, liabilities, position (financial, trading or
otherwise), profits or prospects of the Company or any event or circumstance
that may reasonably result in such a material adverse change; or

  

### (e) by Seller if there shall have been a material breach or breaches by
Buyer of its covenants or agreements hereunder such that the condition set
forth in Section 7.3(a) would be incapable of being satisfied by December 31,
2006,

  

and in each of the cases set out in clauses (a)-(e) above the rights and
liabilities of the parties which have accrued prior to termination shall
continue to subsist and such termination shall be in addition to any other
rights or remedies the terminating party may have against the other party.

     

   



  

## 10.3 _Dispute Resolution_. (a) In the event of any controversy or
claim arising out of, or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or
the interpretation, performance or breach thereof, the parties hereto shall
use their reasonable best efforts to settle such controversy or claim. To
this effect, they shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith
and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and
equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If they do not reach
such solution within a period of 30 days, then upon notice by either party to
the other, any controversy or claim shall be submitted to mediation
administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial
Mediation Rules in New York before resorting to arbitration.

  

### (b) In the event Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any controversy
or claim arising out of, or in connection with or relating to this Agreement
or the interpretation, performance or breach thereof pursuant to Section
10.3(a), the parties hereto irrevocably agree to settle such controversy or
claim arising out of, or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or
the interpretation, performance or breach thereof by binding arbitration
under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association or its
successor and in accordance with applicable law but subject to the following
agreed provisions. The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York,
and the proceedings shall be kept confidential. Notice of papers
or processes relating to any arbitration proceeding, or for the confirmation
of award and entry of judgment on an award may be served on each of the
parties by registered or certified mail at the addresses set forth in Section
10.7 hereof. Each Dispute shall be promptly adjudicated by a panel of three
neutral arbitrators appointed as follows:

  

##### (i) each party shall nominate an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so
appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator who shall act as president of the
arbitral tribunal;

  

##### (ii) if either party fails to nominate an arbitrator within 30 days of
receiving notice of the nomination of an arbitrator by the other party, such
arbitrator shall at the request of that party be appointed by the American
Arbitration Association;

  

##### (iii) if the two arbitrators to be nominated by the parties fail to
agree upon a third arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second
arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be appointed on the nomination of the
American Arbitration Association at the written request of either party; and

  

##### (iv) should a vacancy arise because any arbitrator dies, resigns,
refuses to act, or becomes incapable of performing his functions, the vacancy
shall be filled by the method by which that arbitrator was originally
appointed.

  

All arbitrators shall be of good reputation and character and shall be highly
knowledgeable of entertainment industry matters. Seller shall pay one-half
of the arbitrators expenses and Buyer shall pay one-half. The parties shall
pay their own legal expenses. The arbitrators shall provide a reasoned
opinion supporting their conclusion, including detailed findings of fact and
conclusions of law. Such findings of fact shall be final and binding on the
parties but such conclusions of law shall be subject to appeal in any court
of competent

     

   



  

### jurisdiction.  The arbitrators may award damages and/or permanent
injunctive relief, but in no event shall the arbitrators have the authority
to award punitive or exemplary damages. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 10.3, either party may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction, or other provisional remedy pending final
determination of a claim through arbitration in accordance with this Section
10.3. If proper notice of any hearing has been given, the arbitrators will
have full power to proceed to take evidence or to perform any other acts
necessary to arbitrate the matter in the absence of any party who fails to
appear.

  

## 10.4 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the respective successors, licensees and assigns of
the parties hereto, but any such assignment by either party hereto shall not
relieve such assigning party of any of its obligations or agreements
hereunder; provided that this Agreement may not be assigned by any party
hereto unless expressly agreed to in writing by the other party hereto in its
sole discretion (provided that such express agreement is not required for
assignments by Buyer to an Affiliate or for the collateral assignment of
Buyers rights under this Agreement to any Person providing financing related
to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

## 10.5 _No Waiver_. No waiver by either party hereto of any breach of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty hereunder shall be deemed a
waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same. The exercise of any
right, power or privilege granted to either party herein shall not operate as
a waiver of any default or breach on the part of the other party hereto nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. Each and all of the several rights and remedies
of either party hereto under this Agreement shall be construed as cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

  

## 10.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, including the
exhibits attached hereto and any other agreement or document referred to in
this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous written or oral agreements, arrangements, understandings,
representations and correspondence between them or any of their related
entities or Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect,
and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in
accordance with its terms. No change, modification, alteration, amendment or
agreement to discharge in whole or in part, or waiver of any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, shall be binding upon either party, unless the
same shall be made by a written instrument signed and executed by the
authorized representatives of each party, with the same formality as the
execution of this Agreement.
