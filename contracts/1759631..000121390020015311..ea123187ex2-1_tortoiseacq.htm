Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore, and TortoiseCorp shall cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 3.01_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.02_, each Certificate entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.01_ shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.01_.

  



  

(ii) Within two (2) Business Days (but in no event prior to the Effective
Time), TortoiseCorp shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder
of Company Common Stock, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented by book-entry (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting
from the conversion of Company Preferred Stock not evidenced by Certificates
and Company Convertible Notes described in _Section 3.01(a)_ and _Section
3.01(b)_ , respectively) the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 3.01_, and such Company Common Stock shall
forthwith be cancelled.

  



  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of TortoiseCorp Class A
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of TortoiseCorp Class A
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, TortoiseCorp shall pay or cause to be paid to the
holder of the shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock issued in exchange
therefore, without interest, (i) promptly, but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore
paid with respect to such shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration payable upon conversion of the Company Common Stock (including
shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of Company
Preferred Stock and Company Convertible Notes described in _Section 3.01(a)_
and _Section 3.01(b)_ , respectively) in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to TortoiseCorp, upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this _Section 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to TortoiseCorp for the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of TortoiseCorp free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, TortoiseCorp or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock (including
shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of Company
Preferred Stock and Company Convertible Notes described in _Section 3.01(a)_
and _Section 3.01(b)_ , respectively) for any TortoiseCorp Class A Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law in accordance with this _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub,
TortoiseCorp, and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Options or Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable Taxing
authority in accordance with applicable Law by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Merger Sub, TortoiseCorp or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common
Stock (or intended recipients of compensatory payments) in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is otherwise entitled to
receive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of _Section
3.01_.

  



  

(j) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares representing
fractional shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon
the exchange of Company Common Stock and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder
of TortoiseCorp or a holder of shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock. In
lieu of any fractional share of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock to which
each holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled, the
Exchange Agent shall round up or down to the nearest whole share of
TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash
settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by
rounding.

  



  

Section 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or TortoiseCorp for any reason shall be converted into the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section
3.01_.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders of the Company who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the
DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights shall not
be converted into, and such stockholders shall have no right to receive, the
Per Share Merger Consideration unless and until such stockholder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails to
perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock under Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to
have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, if applicable, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02(b)_ , of
the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as the case may be).

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give TortoiseCorp (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company and any
withdrawals of such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
TortoiseCorp (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for the Company to own, lease

conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have
such Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Company
Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing.

officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by TortoiseCorp, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that

Section 5.13 _TortoiseCorp Trust Fund_. As of the date of this
Agreement, TortoiseCorp has no less than $235,800,000 in the trust fund
established by TortoiseCorp for the benefit of its public stockholders (the "
_Trust Fund_ ") maintained in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(the " _Trust Account_ "). The monies of such Trust Account are invested in
United States Government securities or money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of February 27, 2019, between TortoiseCorp and the Trustee
(the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or
modified and is valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exceptions. TortoiseCorp
has complied in all material respects with the terms of the Trust Agreement
and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist
under the Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by TortoiseCorp or
the Trustee. There are no separate contracts, agreements, side letters or
other understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i)
between TortoiseCorp and the Trustee that would cause the description of the
Trust Agreement in the TortoiseCorp SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any
material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of TortoiseCorp, that would entitle
any person (other than stockholders of TortoiseCorp who shall have elected to
redeem their shares of TortoiseCorp Class A Common Stock pursuant to
the TortoiseCorp Organizational Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in
the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any
interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of
Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions of the TortoiseCorp
Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending
or, to the knowledge of TortoiseCorp, threatened in writing with respect to
the Trust Account. Upon consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, TortoiseCorp shall cause the Trustee
to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to TortoiseCorp
as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust
Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however
that the liabilities and obligations of TortoiseCorp due and owing or incurred
at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including
all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of TortoiseCorp who shall have
exercised their Redemption Rights, (b) with respect to filings, applications
and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement required under Law, (c)
to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with the Trust
Agreement; and (d) to third parties (e.g., professionals, printers, etc.) who
have rendered services to TortoiseCorp in connection with its efforts to
effect the Merger. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance
by the Company with its obligations hereunder, TortoiseCorp has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account
will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be
available to TortoiseCorp at the Effective Time.

employees or retained any contractors, other than consultants and advisors in

pocket expenses incurred by TortoiseCorp's officers and directors in
connection with activities on TortoiseCorp's behalf in an aggregate amount
not in excess of the amount of cash held by TortoiseCorp outside of the Trust

any employee, officer or director. TortoiseCorp and Merger Sub have never and

Company become aware of such inquiry or proposal) notify such person in
writing that the Company is subject to an exclusivity agreement with respect
to the sale of the Company that prohibits them from considering such inquiry
or proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that any

plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (excluding any retiree health plans or
programs, or defined benefit retirement plans or programs) for service accrued
or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company; provided,
however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In addition, subject to the terms
of all governing documents, TortoiseCorp shall use reasonable best efforts to
(i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under each of the employee benefit plans established or maintained
by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries that cover the
Continuing Employees or their dependents, and (ii) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, during
the portion of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, under those health

whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise, including, without
limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any specified

amendment, modification or termination.

shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement or expense reimbursement than are set forth in the bylaws of the
Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries
or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by
applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time, TortoiseCorp agrees that
it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation
or the bylaws of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, TortoiseCorp shall
maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy (true, correct and complete copies of
which have been heretofore made available to TortoiseCorp or its agents or
Representatives in the Virtual Data Room) on terms not less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall
TortoiseCorp be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess
of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such
insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the " _Maximum Annual
Premium_ "); provided, however, that (i) TortoiseCorp may cause coverage to be
extended under the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by
obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing terms not materially
less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect
to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time so long as
the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year
period, any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 7.08(b)_
 shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition
thereof.

  



  

(c) On the Closing Date, TortoiseCorp shall enter into customary

prompt notice to TortoiseCorp, and TortoiseCorp shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of any event which a party becomes aware of between the date of

causes or would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ to fail.

each shall cooperate with the other, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including, without limitation, using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,

periods by, Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the
Company as set forth in _Section 4.05_ necessary for the consummation of the
Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger. In case, at any

of the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with

any documents, information and data contained therewith, between them or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the

action before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with or
intended to delay its action on requests for a consent or the consummation of
the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, TortoiseCorp shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Private Placement in
accordance with the Subscription Agreements, and the Company shall cooperate
with TortoiseCorp in such efforts. TortoiseCorp shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or
modification to any Subscription Agreement that would reasonably be expected
to cause the condition set forth in _Section 8.01(f)_ to fail.

issue any such press release or make any such public statement
(including through social media platforms) without the prior written consent
of the other party. Furthermore, nothing contained in this _Section
7.11_ shall prevent TortoiseCorp or the Company and/or its respective
affiliates from furnishing customary or other reasonable

consented to by the other party in accordance with this _Section 7.11_.

to adversely affect or materially delay the approval of any Governmental
Authority, or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
Antitrust Laws, including by agreeing to merge with or acquire any other
person or acquire a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any
other person. The parties hereto further covenant and agree, with respect to
a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,

(i) taking actions (and not failing to take actions) to cause the Merger to
qualify for the Intended Tax-Free Treatment, and not taking actions (or

(ii) a party promptly notifying the other party that such party knows or has

materially and adversely affects the benefits intended to be conferred upon

thereof (as contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect to any
surrendering, undermining or alteration of such rights).

properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this

may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

  



  

Section 10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this

Delaware or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, any court of the
United States located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages
or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity as expressly permitted in this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law
to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Outside Date any party initiates an Action to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended by: (A) the amount of time during which such Action is pending plus
20 Business Days; or (B) such other time period established by the court

action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection

pursuant to an Underwritten Demand (each such Holder that includes all or a
portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Offering, a " _Requesting Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company, in writing,
within two (2) days (one (1) day if such offering is an overnight or bought
Underwritten Offering) after the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the
Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any such written notification from a
Requesting Holder(s), such Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have

separate written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities (if
any) in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities or
other equity securities of the Company requested to be included in such
Underwritten Offering exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of
equity securities of the Company that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering
without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the
distribution method or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable,

the Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders have requested be included in
such Underwritten Offering (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro
Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities

2.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to (i) file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity

type of securities to be included, the intended method(s) of distribution and

offer to all of the Holders the opportunity to register the sale of such
number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in writing
within (a) five (5) days in the case of filing a Registration Statement and
(b) two (2) days in the case of an Underwritten Offering (unless such
offering is an overnight or bought Underwritten Offering, then one (1)
day), in each case after receipt of such written notice (such Registration a

Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and shall
use its best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a
proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested
by the Holders pursuant to this _subsection 2.2.1_ to be included in a
Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of the Company included in such Piggyback Registration and to
permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such
Holders proposing to include Registrable Securities in an Underwritten
Offering under this _subsection 2.2.1_ shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such
Underwritten Offering by the Company.

Company that the Company desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares
of equity securities of the Company, if any, as to which Registration or
Underwritten Offering has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
Registration or Underwritten Offering has been requested pursuant to _Section

other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities,

Company's account, the Company shall include in any such Registration or
Underwritten Offering (A) first, the Common Stock or other equity securities

Registration or Underwritten Offering has been requested pursuant to written
contractual piggyback registration rights of other stockholders of the
Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of

from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

2.2 _hereof shall not be counted as an Underwritten Offering pursuant to an
Underwritten Demand effected under _Section 2.1 _hereof.

  



  

2.3 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) the Holders have requested
an Underwritten Offering pursuant to an Underwritten Demand and the Company
and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly
underwrite the offer; or (B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to an Underwritten Demand and in the good faith judgment of
the Board such Registration or Underwritten Offering would be seriously
detrimental to the Company and the Board concludes as a result that it is
essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement or the
undertaking of such Underwritten Offering at such time, then in each case the
Company shall furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of
the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be
seriously detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be
filed or to undertake such Underwritten Offering in the near future and that
it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement
or undertaking of such Underwritten Offering. In such event, the Company shall
have the right to defer such filing or offering for a period of not more than
thirty (30) days; provided, however, that the Company shall not defer its
obligation in this manner more than once in any twelve (12)-month period.

discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set
forth in the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

  



  

3.3 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No person or
entity may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder
unless such person or entity (i) agrees to sell such person's or entity's
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Company and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements
and other customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting arrangements.

  



  

3.4  _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains
a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until he, she or it has received copies of a
supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such
notice), or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company that the
use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or
continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration or
Underwritten Offering at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving
prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or
initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for
the shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose. In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentences in
this _Section 3.4_, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notices referred to in this _Section 3.4_, their use of the
Prospectus relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer
to sell Registrable Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the
Holders of the expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights
under this _Section 3.4_.

  



  

   

A-12

 



    



  

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it
shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of
Registrable Securities held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions. Upon
the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written
certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

  



  

Article 4 _ 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
(collectively, the " _Holder Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and inclusive of all reasonable attorneys' fees arising out of the
enforcement of each such persons' rights under this _Section 4.1_) resulting
from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in
any information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such
Holder Indemnified Person specifically for use therein.

  



  

   

A-13

 



    



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall, severally and not
jointly, indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and agents and
each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and inclusive of all reasonable attorneys' fees
arising out of the enforcement of each such persons' rights under this
_Section 4.1_) resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading, but only to the extent that the same
are made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to the
Holder so furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder
specifically for use therein. In no event shall the liability of any selling
Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the net proceeds received by such
Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

  



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim or there may be reasonable defenses available to the
indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense
of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to
any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying
party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No
indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot
be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid
by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.

  



  

   

A-14

 



    



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to
herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified
party, shall to the extent permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or
such indemnified party and the indemnifying party's and indemnified party's
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such action; provided, however, that the liability of any Holder
under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net
proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such
liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or
other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_, _4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above,
any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such
party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

Article 5 _ 
 MISCELLANEOUS_

on the third (3rd) business day following the date on which it is mailed, in
the case of notices delivered by courier service, hand delivery, telecopy
or telegram, at such time as it is delivered to the addressee (with the
delivery receipt or the affidavit of messenger) or at such time as delivery
is refused by the addressee upon presentation, and in the case of notices
delivered by facsimile or email, at such time as it is successfully
transmitted to the addressee. Any notice or communication under this Agreement

Registrable Securities or such other address as may be designated in writing

change its address for notice at any time and from time to time by written
notice to the other parties hereto, and such change of address shall become
effective thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice as provided in this
_Section 5.1_.

  



  

5.2  _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

5.2.1 This Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations of the Company
hereunder may not be assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in
part.

  



  

5.2.2 This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties and its successors.

  



  

5.2.3 This Agreement shall not confer any rights or benefits on any persons
that are not parties hereto, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and _Section 5.2_ hereof.

   



  

   

A-15

 



    



  

5.2.4 No assignment by any party hereto of such party's rights, duties and
obligations hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate the Company unless
and until the Company shall have received (i) written notice of such
assignment as provided in _Section 5.1 _hereof and (ii) the written
agreement of the assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement (which may be
accomplished by an addendum or certificate of joinder to this Agreement). Any
transfer or assignment made other than as provided in this _Section 5.2_
shall be null and void.

  



  

5.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including facsimile or PDF counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an
original, and all of which together shall constitute the same instrument, but
only one of which need be produced.

  



  

5.4 _Governing Law; Venue_. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT
MAY BE EXECUTED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE
THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK AS APPLIED TO AGREEMENTS AMONG NEW YORK RESIDENTS ENTERED
INTO AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE
CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.

  



  

5.5 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the Company
and the Holders of at least a majority in interest of the
Registrable Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the
provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be
waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or
modified; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in
his, her or its capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the
Company, in a manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in
such capacity) shall require the consent of the Holder so affected. No course
of dealing between any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or
any failure or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any
rights or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any
rights or remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise
of any rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a
waiver or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

  



  

5.6 _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that no
person, other than a Holder of Registrable Securities, has any right to
require the Company to register any securities of the Company for sale or to
include such securities of the Company in any Registration filed by the
Company for the sale of securities for its own account or for the account of
any other person. Further, the Company represents and warrants that this
Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or
agreement with similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict
between any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

5.7  _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth
(10th) anniversary of the date of this Agreement and (ii) the date as of
which the Holders cease to hold any Registrable Securities. The provisions of
_Article 4_ shall survive any termination.

Re: Lock-Up Agreement1

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter (this " _Letter Agreement_ ") is being delivered to you in
accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the " _BCA_ ") entered into by and among Hyliion Holdings
Corp., a Delaware corporation f/k/a Tortoise Acquisition Corp. (the "
_Company_ "), SHLL Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Hyliion Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Hyliion_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into Hyliion on or about the date hereof (the "
_Merger_ "), with Hyliion surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company.

  



  

In order to induce the Company to proceed with the Merger and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned (the " _Securityholder_ ") hereby agrees with
the Company as follows:

  



  

1. Subject to the exceptions set forth herein, the Securityholder agrees not
to, without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the
Company, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate,
pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to
dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent
position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the
meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, any shares of Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Class A Common Stock_
") held by it immediately after the effective time of the Merger, any shares
of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase
shares of Class A Common Stock held by it immediately after the effective time
of the Merger, or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Class A Common Stock held by it immediately after the
effective time of the Merger, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement
that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of any of such shares of Class A Common Stock or
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common
Stock, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such
securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any intention to
effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) (the actions specified
in clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, " _Transfer_ ") until 180 days after the
closing date of the Merger (the " _Lock-up_ "). [Thereafter, until two (2)
years after the closing date of the Merger (the " _Extended Lock-Up_ "),
subject to the exceptions set forth herein, the Securityholder agrees not to
Transfer more than 10% of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock held
by it immediately after the effective time of the Merger, or issuable upon the
exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock held by it
immediately after the effective time of the Merger.]2

Technologies, Inc., Sumitomo Corporation of Americas, Axioma Ventures, LLC,
FJ Management Inc., New Era Capital Partners, L.P., CRA Fund II LLC
(Berkshire), Colle HLN Associates LLC , Colle Capital Partners, HYL Investors,
all current directors of Hyliion and their affiliates (to that extent that

B-2

 



    



  

2. The restrictions set forth in paragraph 1 shall not apply to:

  



   | (i)| in the case of an entity, Transfers to a stockholder, partner,
member or affiliate of such entity; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| in the case of an individual, Transfers by gift to members of
the individual's immediate family (as defined below) or to a trust, the
beneficiary of which is a member of one of the individual's immediate
family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| in the case of an individual, Transfers by virtue of laws of
descent and distribution upon death of the individual; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| in the case of an individual, Transfers pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| in the case of an entity, Transfers by virtue of the laws of the
state of the entity's organization and the entity's organizational documents
upon dissolution of the entity; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| transactions relating to Class A Common Stock or other
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common
Stock acquired in open market transactions after the effective time of the
Merger, _provided_  that no such transaction is required to be, or is,
publicly announced (whether on Form 4, Form 5 or otherwise, other than a
required filing on Schedule 13F, 13G or 13G/A) during the Lock-Up; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vii)| the exercise of any options or warrants to purchase Class A
Common Stock (which exercises may be effected on a cashless basis to the
extent the instruments representing such options or warrants permit exercises
on a cashless basis); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (viii)| Transfers to the Company to satisfy tax withholding
obligations pursuant to the Company's equity incentive plans or arrangements; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ix)| Transfers to the Company pursuant to any contractual arrangement
in effect at the effective time of the Merger that provides for the
repurchase by the Company or forfeiture of the Securityholder's Class A Common
Stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Class A Common Stock in connection with the termination of the
Securityholder's service to the Company; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

B-3

 



    



   | (x)| the entry, by the Securityholder, at any time after the effective
time of the Merger, of any trading plan providing for the sale of Class A
Common Stock by the Securityholder, which trading plan meets the requirements
of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , _however_ , that such
plan does not provide for, or permit, the sale of any Class A Common Stock
during the Lock-Up [or more than 10% of the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock held by the Securityholder immediately after the effective time of the
Merger, or issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock held by it immediately after the effective time of the Merger,
during the Extended Lock-Up]3 and no public announcement or filing is
voluntarily made or required regarding such plan during the Lock-Up; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (xi)| transactions in the event of completion of a liquidation,
merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of
the Company's securityholders having the right to exchange their shares of
Class A Common Stock for cash, securities or other property; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (xii)| transactions to satisfy any U.S. federal, state, or local
income tax obligations of the Securityholder (or its direct or indirect
owners) arising from a change in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Regulations_ ") after the date on which the BCA was
executed by the parties, and such change prevents the Merger from qualifying
as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368 of the Code (and the Merger
does not qualify for similar tax-free treatment pursuant to any successor or
other provision of the Code or Regulations taking into account such changes). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

 _provided, however_ , that (A) in the case of clauses (i) through (v), these
permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement, in substantially
the form of this Letter Agreement (it being understood that any references to
"immediate family" in the agreement executed by such transferee shall
expressly refer only to the immediate family of the Securityholder and not to
the immediate family of the transferee), agreeing to be bound by these
Transfer restrictions. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family"
shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild or other lineal
descendant (including by adoption), father, mother, brother or sister of the
undersigned; and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 405

one or more Inspectors of Election. Each Inspector of Election, before
entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of an Inspector of Election at such meeting
with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. If
appointed, Inspectors of Election shall take charge of the polls and, when

signed by the holders of record of shares of the stock of the
Corporation, issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted.

business; provided, that if at any meeting of the Board of Directors there
shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn
the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. Except

Directors shall hold office until the next annual election and until their
successors shall have been elected and shall have qualified, unless sooner
displaced.

  



  

Whenever any vacancy shall have occurred in the Board of Directors, by reason

Board, if one be elected, or the President, by oral, telegraphic or written
notice, duly served on or sent or mailed to each director not less than two
days before such meeting. A meeting of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice immediately after the annual meeting of Stockholders at the
same place at which such meeting was held. Notice need not be given of
regular meetings of the Board of Directors. Any meeting may be held without
notice, if all directors are present, or if notice is waived in writing,
either before or after the meeting, by those not present. Participation of one
or more directors by conference telephone allowing all persons participating

resolution appointing them. A majority of any such committee may determine its
action and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board of
Directors shall otherwise provide. The Board of Directors shall have power at
any time to change the membership of any such committee, to fill vacancies in
it, or to dissolve it.

  



  

Section 4. _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be
taken without a meeting, if prior to such action a written consent or consents
thereto is signed by all members of the Board of Directors, or of such
committee as the case may be, and such written consent or consents is
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee,
as applicable.

Board of Directors, or of any committee of the Board of Directors. In
addition, the Board of Directors shall also have power, in its discretion, to

D-5

 



    



  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION _

  



  

Section 1. _Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall indemnify its
directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ") or any other applicable
law; provided, however, that the Corporation may modify the extent of such
indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and officers;
and, provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be required to
indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly
required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the
Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
Corporation under the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv) such
indemnification is required to be made under Section 4 of this Article IV.

  



  

Section 2. _Employees and other Agents_. The Corporation shall have power to
indemnify its employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any
other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate
the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such
person as the Board of Directors shall determine.

  



  

Section 3. _Expenses_. The Corporation shall advance to any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of
the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by
any director or officer in connection with such proceeding, provided,
however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a
director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not
in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such
indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit
plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking
(hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay
all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter
a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this Article IV or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined
pursuant to Section 5 of this Article IV, no advance shall be made by the
Corporation to an officer of the Corporation (except by reason of the fact
that such officer is or was a director of the Corporation in which event this
sentence shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably
and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to
the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors
designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a
quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct,
by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to
the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate
clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner
that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 4. _Enforcement_. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
officers under this Article IV shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
Corporation and the director or officer. Any right to indemnification or
advances granted by this Article IV to a director or officer shall be
enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of
competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is
denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made
within ninety (90) days of request therefor. To the extent permitted by law,
the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In
connection with any claim for indemnification, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any
other applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the Corporation
(except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or
was a director of the Corporation) for advances, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing
evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person
did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such
person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable
law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce
a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the
burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article IV or
otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

   

D-6

 



    



  

Section 5. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL or any other applicable law.

  



  

Section 6. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Article IV shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

Section 7. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article IV.

  



  

Section 8. _Amendments_. Any repeal or modification of this Article IV shall
only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article IV in
effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 9. _Saving Clause_.

  

If this Article IV or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground
by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full extent not
prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article IV that shall not have
been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Article IV shall be
invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another
jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall indemnify each director and executive
officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.

  



  

Section 10. _Certain Definitions_.

  



  

For the purposes of this Article IV, the following definitions shall apply:

  



  

(1) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative.

  



  

(2) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without
limitation, court costs, attorneys' fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid
in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or
kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

  



  

(3) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the
provisions of this Article IV with respect to the resulting or surviving

references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the
request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation" as referred to in this section.

  



  

ARTICLE V

  



  

 _CAPITAL STOCK_

  



  

Section 1. _Certificates_. The interest of each Stockholder may be evidenced
by certificates for shares of stock in such form as the Board of Directors
may from time to time prescribe. The certificates of stock shall be signed by
the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary, or the Treasurer, or
an Assistant Secretary, or an Assistant Treasurer, sealed with the seal of the
Corporation or a facsimile thereof, if any, and countersigned and registered
in such manner, if any, as the Board of Directors may by
resolution prescribe. Where any such certificate is countersigned by a
transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee, or registered by a
registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, the signature of any
such officer may be a facsimile signature. In case any officer or officers
who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have
been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such
officer or officers of the Corporation, whether because of death,
resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have
been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may
nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as
though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or
whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not
ceased to be such officer or officers of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 2. _Transfer_. The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
transferred only upon the books of the Corporation by the holder thereof in
person or by his or her attorney, upon surrender for cancellation of
certificates for the same number of shares, with an assignment and power of
transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof
of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation or its agents may
reasonably require.

  



  

Section 3. _Record Dates_. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date,
not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days preceding the date of
any meeting of Stockholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or
the date for the distribution or allotment of any rights, or the date when
any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, as a
record date for the determination of the Stockholders entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, any such meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any such
dividend, or to receive any distribution or allotment of such rights, or to
exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of
capital stock, and in such case only such Stockholders as shall be
Stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice
of, and to vote at, such meeting, or to receive payment of such dividend, or
to receive such distribution or allotment or rights or to exercise such
rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the
books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.

  



  

   

D-8

 



    



  

Section 4. _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any certificate of stock is
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, the Board of Directors may authorize
the issuance of a new certificate of the same tenor and for the same number of
shares in lieu thereof. The Board of Directors may in its discretion, before
the issuance of such new certificate, require the owner of the lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate, or the legal representative of
the owner to make an affidavit or affirmation setting forth such facts as to
the loss, destruction or mutilation as it deems necessary, and to give the
Corporation a bond in such reasonable sum as it directs to indemnify the
Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE VI

  



  

 _CHECKS, NOTES, ETC._

  



  

Section 1. _Checks, Notes, Etc._ All checks and drafts on the Corporation's
bank accounts and all bills of exchange and promissory notes, and all
acceptances, obligations and other instruments for the payment of money, may
be signed by any director of the Corporation, the President, any Vice
President or the Treasurer and may also be signed by such other officer or
officers, agent or agents, as shall be thereunto authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors.

the shares of stock of the Corporation, issued and outstanding and entitled

the vote of at least a majority of the entire Board of Directors; provided
that any by-law adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed
by the Stockholders in the manner set forth above.

  



  

Any proposal to amend or repeal these By-Laws or to adopt new by-laws shall
be stated in the notice of the meeting of the Board of Directors or the

Second AMENDED AND RESTATED

  

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  

  

OF

  

  

TORTOISE ACQUISITION CORP.

  



  

Thomas Healy hereby certifies that:

  



  

ONE: The name of this company is Tortoise Acquisition Corp. and the date of
filing the original Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation with the
Secretary of State of Delaware was November 7, 2018.

  



  

TWO: Thomas Healy is the duly elected and acting Chief Executive Officer of
Tortoise Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation.

  



  

THREE: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of this
corporation is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:

  



  

I.

  



  

The name of this corporation is Hyliion Holdings Corp. (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

II.

  



  

The address of the Company's registered office in the State of Delaware is
Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

  



  

III.

  



  

The purpose of the Company is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation
Law (" _DGCL_ ").

  



  

IV.

  



  

A. The Company is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated,
respectively, " _Common Stock_ " and " _Preferred Stock_." The total number
of shares which the Company is authorized to issue is 260,000,000 shares.
250,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one-
hundredth of one cent ($0.0001). 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock,
each having a par value of one-hundredth of one cent ($0.0001).

  



  

B. Effective immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_ "), each
one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the " _Class A Common Stock_ "), that was issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be reclassified, redesignated
and changed into (a) one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the "
_Common Stock_ "), without any further action by the Company or any
stockholder thereof. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Prior
Certificate_ ") shall, until surrendered to the Company in exchange for a
certificate representing the same number of shares of Common Stock,
automatically represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the
shares of Class A Common Stock represented by the Prior Certificate shall have
been reclassified and redesignated.

  



   

E-2

 



    

  



  

C. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") is hereby
expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all or any number of the
shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of
shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers,
full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and
relative, participating, optional, or other rights and such qualifications,
limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the
issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the DGCL. The Board of
Directors is also expressly authorized to increase or decrease the number of
shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but
not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the
number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the
foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the
status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution
originally fixing the number of shares of such series. The number of
authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not
below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Company
entitled to vote thereon, without a separate vote of the holders of the
Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders
is required pursuant to the terms of any certificate of designation filed
with respect to any series of Preferred Stock.

  



  

D. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to
one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Company
for their vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law,
holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of
Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either
separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such
series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

  



  

V.

  



  

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Company, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of
the Company, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof,
as the case may be, it is further provided that:

  



  

A.

  



  

1\. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
Company shall be vested in the Board of Directors. The number of directors
which shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by
resolutions adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors.

  



  

2\. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the directors shall
be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III,
respectively. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the
Board of Directors already in office to such classes at the time the
classification becomes effective. At the first annual meeting of
stockholders following the initial classification of the Board of Directors,
the term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I
directors shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the second
annual meeting of stockholders following such initial classification, the
term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II directors
shall be elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting
of stockholders following such initial classification, the term of office of
the Class III directors shall expire and Class III directors shall be elected
for a full term of three years. At each succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to
succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.

  



   

E-3

 



    



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, each director shall
serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier
death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

  



  

3\. REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable
law, any individual director or directors may be removed with cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of
all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote
generally at an election of directors.

  



  

4\. VACANCIES. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law and
subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any
vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall, unless the
Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly
created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders and except as
otherwise provided by applicable law, be filled only by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum
of the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected
in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder
of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or
occurred and until such director's successor shall have been elected and
qualified.

  



  

B.

  



  

1\. BYLAW AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the

  

Company. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws of the Company
by the Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the
authorized number of directors. The stockholders shall also have power to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; _provided, however,_ that,
in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the
Company required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

2\. The directors of the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless
the Bylaws so provide.

  



  

3\. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Company except at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the
Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent
or electronic transmission.

  



  

4\. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors
and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company shall be given in the manner provided in the
Bylaws of the Company.

  



  

VI.

  



  

A. The liability of the directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  



  

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company is
authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
directors, officers and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which
applicable law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw
provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise in excess of the
indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by such applicable law.
If applicable law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this
Article VI to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the
Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law as so amended.

  



  

   

E-4

 



    



  

C. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall only be prospective
and shall not affect the rights or protections or increase the liability of
any director under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged
occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or
indemnification.

  



  

VII.

  



  

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall (or, if and only
if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and
only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of
actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any
action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim of breach
of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other
employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders; (C) any
action or proceeding (including any class action) asserting a claim against
the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of
the Company arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the
Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or
proceeding (including any class action) to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (including any right, obligation
or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL
confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or
(F) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer
or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine,
in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the
court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as
defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a
duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

  



  

B. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be
the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

  



  

C. Any person or entity purchasing, holding, owning or otherwise acquiring
any interest in any security of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of
and to have consented to the provisions of this Article VII.

  



  

VIII.

  



  

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except
as provided in paragraph B. of this Article VIII, and all rights conferred
upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

  



  



  

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise
permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of
the holders of any particular class or series of the Company required by law
or by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any
certificate of designation filed with respect to a series of Preferred Stock,
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of
all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and
VIII.

  

   

FOUR: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been
duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

  



  

FIVE: This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was
approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of the Company. This
