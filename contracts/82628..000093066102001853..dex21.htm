_ SECTION 2.2 Conversion of Shares and Merger Consideration _



(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof:



(i) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.25 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted, and such shares shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with this Section 2.2(a)(i).



(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock (a "Company Share") held by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by any subsidiary of the Company, by Parent
or by any subsidiary of Parent ((together with the associated Company Right
(as defined in Section 4.2, if any), shall be cancelled, and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.



(iii) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(d), each Company
Share (together with the associated Company Right) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.2(a)(ii)), by virtue of the Merger will be converted into the right
to receive 2.7609 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent common stock
("Parent Common Stock"). All references in this Agreement to Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to include the
corresponding right to purchase stock of Parent pursuant to the Parent Rights
Agreement.



(b) The Parent Common Stock to be received as consideration pursuant to the
Merger by each holder of Company Shares (together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as specified below) is referred to
herein as the "Merger Consideration."



(c) From and after the Effective Time, all Company Shares converted in
accordance with Section 2.2(a)(iii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such Company Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as applicable, and any dividends payable pursuant to Section
2.3(f).



(d) To the extent that the Certified Estimate of Company Transaction Fees
exceeds $4,900,000, the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to the product
obtained (rounded to four decimal places) by multiplying 2.7609 by the
fraction whose denominator is the Implied Transaction Value (as defined below)
and whose numerator is equal to the remainder obtained after subtracting from
the Implied Transaction Value the amount by which the Companys Transaction
Fees exceed $4,900,000. As used in this Section 2.2(d) the Implied Transaction
Value shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying 18,402,000 by the
closing price on the NNM of a share of Parent Common Stock on the last
trading day prior to the date of this Agreement ($6.41). Any reduction in the
Exchange Ratio shall be scheduled at _Schedule 2.2(d)_.



(e) No later than fifteen calendar days prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting, Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate, duly executed on
behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, setting forth in aggregate, and itemized by vendor, the Companys
then current estimate after due inquiry and investigation of Company
Transaction Fees through the anticipated Closing Date (the "Certified
Estimate"), and attaching to the Certified Estimate such documentation upon
which the amounts set forth therein are based. 

 

7 ##### Table of Contents

  

 To the extent the Certified Estimate exceeds $4,900,000, the Exchange Ratio
shall be reduced forthwith consistent with Section 2.2(d) and such reduction
shall be scheduled at _Schedule 2.2(d)_.



_ SECTION 2.3 Surrender and Payment_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing Company Shares
(the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make available
to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered in
respect of the Company Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record at
the Effective Time of Company Shares a letter of transmittal for use in such
exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent).



(b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Shares represented by such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration.



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
registration that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
registration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.



(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders
Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders Company Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. 



(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this
Section 2.3. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following such
surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such
surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common
Stock, all Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

_ SECTION 2.4 Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Warrants_.



(a) Except as provided below in Section 2.4(f), at the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Company Shares (a "Company Stock Option")
granted under the Companys plans identified in Section 2.4 of the Disclosure
Schedule (as defined in the introductory clause to Article 4 below) as being
the only compensation or benefit plans or agreements pursuant to which Company
Shares may be issued (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), whether
vested or not vested, shall be deemed assumed by Parent and shall thereafter
be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
(including any provisions for acceleration) as were applicable under such
Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time (in accordance with the past
practice of the Company with respect to interpretation and application of such
terms and conditions), the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (x) the number of
Company Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, at a price per share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (a) the exercise
price per Company Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock
Option divided by (b) the Exchange Ratio. The parties intend that the
conversion of the Company Stock Options hereunder will meet the requirements
of section 424(a) of the Code and this Section 2.4(a) shall be interpreted
consistent with such intention. The terms of the Company Stock Plans permit
the assumption of options to purchase Company Common Stock as provided
in this Section 2.4(a), without the consent or approval of the holders of
such options, shareholders or otherwise. Except as provided below in Section
2.4(f), the Merger will not terminate or accelerate any Company Stock Option
or any right of exercise, vesting or repur­chase relating thereto with
respect to Parent Common Stock acquired upon exercise of such assumed Company
Stock Option. Holders of Company Stock Options will not be entitled to acquire
Company Shares after the Merger. In addition, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will make any amendments to the terms of such stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4. 



(b) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery pursuant to
the terms set forth in this Section 2.4.



(c) No later than thirty-five (35) days following the Effective Time, Parent
shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to
a previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to options and other equity-based awards described in this Section
2.4, and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the current status of
the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such options or other equity-
based awards remain outstanding.



(d) Each Warrant that remains outstanding following the Effective Time shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the documents governing such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) such Warrant will be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the product of the number
of Company Shares that were purchasable under the Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise
price for Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant will be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate exercise price of
such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock for which such Warrant shall be exercisable as
determined in accordance with the preceding clause (i), rounded to the nearest
whole cent.



(e) Parent shall assume the Companys obligations, and shall be assigned the
Companys repurchase rights and purchase options, under any Restricted Stock
Purchase Agreements entered into pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the
other restricted stock purchase agreements listed on Section 2.4(e) _of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ , true and correct copies of which have been
made available by the Company to Parent. Any 

 

9 ##### Table of Contents

  

 and all restrictions on the Company restricted stock issued pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans or such other agreements which do not lapse in accordance
with their terms shall continue in full force and effect until such
restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of such agreements, and any
repurchase rights or repurchase options which the Company has with respect to
the Company restricted stock shall also continue in full force and effect; 
_provided, however_ , that the per share repurchase price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to any such repurchase right or repurchase option
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share repurchase
price of such Company restricted stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent). The terms of
the Company Stock Plans permit the assumption of the Companys obligations and
assignment of the Companys repurchase rights and purchase options as
provided in this Section 2.4(e), without the consent or approval of holders of
such Company restricted stock, and the Merger will not accelerate the vesting
of such stock or terminate any right of repurchase or purchase options with
respect thereto.



(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not
continue the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") or
assume any rights issued thereunder, or substitute for such rights any rights
covering stock of Parent, and the Company ESPP and any rights thereunder
shall terminate upon the Effective Time. The terms of the Company ESPP permit
the Company to shorten and terminate an offering upon the Merger without the
consent or approval of participants in the Company ESPP, shareholders or
otherwise.



_ SECTION 2.5 Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company (other than as
contemplated in Section 4.2 or permitted under this Agreement) shall occur,
including, without limitation, by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.



_ SECTION 2.6 Fractional Shares. _



(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Shares otherwise entitled
to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.6, a
cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (i) the fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder otherwise would be entitled to by
(ii) the closing price on the NNM of a share of Parent Common Stock on the
Closing Date.



(b) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Company Shares in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts
to such holders of Company Shares without interest.



_ SECTION 2.7 Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be.



_ SECTION 2.8 Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange 

 

10 ##### Table of Contents

  

 for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Company Shares represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Article 2. 



_ SECTION 2.9 Shares Held by Company Affiliates_. Anything to the
contrary herein notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or
certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any
Person who may be an "affiliate" of the Company (identified pursuant to
Section 7.9) until such Person shall have delivered to Parent a duly executed
letter as contemplated in Section 7.9. Such Person shall be subject to the
restrictions described in such letter, and such shares (or certificates
therefor) shall bear a legend describing such restrictions.



_ SECTION 2.10 Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of Company
Shares in connection with the Merger.

in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, which states
or jurisdictions are listed on _Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Exhibit 21 to the

of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and

liabilities or obligations, secured or unsecured (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be reflected on the
Company Balance Sheet under GAAP) not reflected in the financial statements or
the accompanying notes thereto, except for liabilities and obligations that
have arisen in the ordinary course of business prior to the date of the
financial statements and which, under GAAP, would not have been required to be
reflected in the financial statements. All accounts receivable of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have arisen from bona fide transactions of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in the ordinary course of business.
The Company maintains and will continue to maintain a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP.

administered in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws
and regulations, including but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Each Employee Plan that
is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code and each trust
forming a part thereof that is intended to be exempt from taxation under
section 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualification and tax-exempt status and nothing
has occurred, whether by any action or any failure to act, since the date of
such determination letter that could adversely affect the qualification of
such Employee Plan or the tax-exempt status of such related trust. No event

condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company that

Disclosure Schedule_ , no Employee Plan provides post-retirement health and
medical, life or other insurance benefits for retired employees of the Company

statute, including benefits provided pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as codified in Code section 4980B and ERISA
sections 601 et seq., as amended from time to time ("COBRA")). The unfunded
post retirement benefit obligation (determined as of December 31, 2001 in
accordance with United States Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 106) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to all post
retirement benefits of their current and former employees equals the amount
set forth in the Company Balance Sheet.



(g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the twelve (12)
months ended on the Balance Sheet Date.

for the purpose of providing or otherwise making available retirement benefits
to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,

no condition exists that is likely to cause the loss or denial of such tax-
favored status;

liabilities.

Proprietary Rights, owned, possessed or used by any third party. There are no

Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Proprietary Rights owned by
the Company or any Subsidiary, and to the Knowledge of the Company, none has
been threatened against the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no facts or alleged facts which would reasonably serve
as a basis for any claim that the Company or any Subsidiary does not have the
right to use and to transfer the right to use, free of any rights or claims of
others, all Proprietary Rights in the development, manufacture, use, sale or
other disposition of any or all products or services presently being used,

Proprietary Right.

due as of the date of this Agreement have been made. The registrations and

possessed or used by any third party. There are no claims, disputes, actions,
proceedings, suits or appeals pending against Parent and its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Proprietary Rights owned by Parent or

 any Subsidiary, and to the Knowledge of Parent, none has been threatened
against Parent and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
facts or alleged facts which would reasonably serve as a basis for any claim
that Parent or any Subsidiary does not have the right to use and to transfer
the right to use, free of any rights or claims of others, all Proprietary
Rights in the development, manufacture, use, sale or other disposition of any
or all products or services presently being used, furnished or sold in the
conduct of the business of Parent or such Subsidiary as it has been and is now
being conducted. To the Knowledge of Parent (i) the Proprietary Rights owned
by Parent are free of any unresolved ownership disputes with respect to any
third party and (ii) there is no unauthorized use, infringement or
misappropriation of any of such Proprietary Rights by any third party,
including any employee or former employee of Parent or any Subsidiary nor, is
there any breach of any license, sublicense or other agreement authorizing
another party to use such Proprietary Rights. Parent has not nor has any
Subsidiary entered into any agreement granting any third party the right to
bring infringement actions with respect to, or otherwise to enforce rights
with respect to, any Proprietary Right.



(c) All material registrations and filings relating to Proprietary Rights are
in good standing. All maintenance and renewal fees necessary to preserve the
rights of Parent and its Subsidiaries in respect of Proprietary Rights due as
of the date of this Agreement have been made. The registrations and filings
relating to Proprietary Rights are proceeding and there are no facts of which
Parent and its Subsidiaries have Knowledge which could significantly
undermine those registrations or filings or reduce to a significant extent the
scope of protection of any patents arising from such applications beyond that
which ordinarily might occur in a patent prosecution proceeding. 



(d) Parent is not, and will not be as a result of the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby in breach, violation or default of any third
party Proprietary Rights. The rights of Parent to the Proprietary Rights will
not be affected by the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.



(e) Parent and each Subsidiary have taken all other measures it deems
reasonable and appropriate to maintain the confidentiality of the Proprietary
Rights used or proposed to be used in the conduct of its business the value
of which to Parent and its Subsidiaries is contingent upon maintenance of the
confidentiality thereof.



_ SECTION 5.17 No Misleading Statements._ No representation or
warranty made herein, in the Parent Disclosure Schedule or in the appendices,
schedules and exhibits attached hereto or any certificate furnished or to be
furnished to Parent pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (when read together) contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading now or at the Effective Time. Parent
has disclosed to Company all material information of which it is aware
relating specifically to the operations and business of the Parent as of the
date of this Agreement or relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will continue to disclose promptly to Company such additional
material information of which it becomes aware after the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time.



_ SECTION 5.18 Compliance with Law._ All licenses, franchises,
permits, clearances, consents, certificates and other evidences of authority
of Parent and its Subsidiaries which are necessary to the conduct of Parents
and its Subsidiaries respective businesses ("Permits") are in full force and
effect and Parent is not nor is any Subsidiary in violation of any Permit in
any respect, except for such exceptions or violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. Except for exceptions which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been conducted in
accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders and other
requirements of governmental authorities.

securities of the Company or any merger, consolidation, business combination
or similar transaction involving the Company; (b) any sale, lease (other than
in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than

Acquisition Proposal for or in respect of at least a majority of the
outstanding Company Shares on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its
financial advisors) to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders than
the terms of the Merger, and is from a Person that in the reasonable judgment
of the Companys Board of Directors (after consultation with a nationally
recognized investment bank, it being recognized for the purposes of this
Section 6.4 that Robertson Stephens, Inc. is a nationally recognized
investment bank) is financially capable of consummating such proposal.

Representatives"), shall directly or indirectly, initiate, encourage, solicit

Proposal (as defined below). Parent further agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of its or its Subsidiaries officers or directors
shall, and that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause Parent
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, have any discussions with or
provide any confidential information or data to any Person relating to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal or engage in any negotiations concerning a Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (a) making
any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of its Board
of Directors, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable law; (b) negotiating with or furnishing
confidential information to any Person who has made a bona fide unsolicited
written Parent Acquisition Proposal, or entering into an agreement with such
Person in connection with a Parent

Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a breach of this Section 6.5;

to its stockholders such a Parent Acquisition Proposal with or without a
Change in Parent Recommendation (as defined at Section 7.1(c), below). Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a Parent Acquisition Proposal.



For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Acquisition Proposal" means, in
respect of the Parent, a bona fide proposal for or in respect of (i) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, or similar transaction
involving the Parent pursuant to which the stockholders of the Parent
immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than fifty percent
(50%) of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity
of such transaction, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the Parent of assets
representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate fair market
value of the Parents business immediately prior to such sale, or (iii) the
acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an
exchange offer or issuance by the Parent), directly or indirectly, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Parent, from a Person that in the
reasonable judgment of Parents Board of Directors (based on advice from a
nationally recognized investment bank, it being recognized for the purposes of
this Section 6.5 that RBC Dain Rauscher, Inc., a member company of RBC
Capital Markets, is a nationally recognized investment bank) is financially
capable of consummating such proposal.

Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party hereto discovering such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by law,

disclose under applicable law), and (b) all other information concerning it
and its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request; _provided, however_ , that either Parent or the Company may restrict
the foregoing access to the extent that (i) any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any governmental entity applicable to it or any contract
requires it or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to 

 

39 ##### Table of Contents

  

 any such properties or information or (ii) the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third party. Each of Parent and the Company
will hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.3 in confidence

contemplated by this Agreement, and, to supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to

efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act or any other applicable regulatory law and the
receipt of Required Approvals under such other laws or from such governmental
entities as soon as practicable and (ii) not to extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other applicable regulatory law or enter into any

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (assuming the Merger has
been consummated) or to substantially impair the benefits to Parent and the
Company expected, as of the date hereof, to be realized from consummation of
the Merger, and neither Parent or the Company shall be required to agree to or
effect any divestiture, hold separate any business or take any other action
that is not conditional on the consummation of the Merger.



(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.4(a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its
reasonable commercial efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) subject to applicable law, permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed written communication between it and any
governmental entity, (iii) promptly inform each other of (and, at the other
partys reasonable request, supply to such other party) any communication (or
other correspondence or memoranda) received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other governmental entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iv) consult with each other in advance to the extent practicable
of any meeting or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other governmental

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
hereto contained in Section 7.4(a) and 7.4(b), if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any applicable regulatory law
of the United States, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or
enforced by a governmental entity that would make the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable
commercial efforts, including, subject to Section 7.4(a), selling, holding
separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting their business in a specified
manner, or agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct
their business in a specified manner or permitting the sale, holding separate
or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries or the conducting of their business in a specified manner, to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative
order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
7.4 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(c) so long as such party hereto has up to then
complied with its obligations under this Section 7.4.



(d) Each of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors
shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other

certificates evidencing any Parent Stock to be received by any such
individuals pursuant to this Agreement, and to issue appropriate transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock consistent
with the terms of the Lock-up Agreement.

or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Merger, Parent
and the Company will consult with each other as to its form and substance and

Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party of (a) any notice of, or
other communication relating to, a breach of this Agreement or event which,

any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, under any contract to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or it, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective

alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



_ SECTION 7.8 Expenses._ Except as set forth in Section 9.5, Parent and

provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent reasonably
requests for purposes of reviewing such list. the Company shall use

any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to continue to participate in
either Parents or the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit
plans in accordance with the terms of those plans and to the extent
such plans and programs provide the following benefits: medical/dental/vision
care, life insurance, disability income, sick pay, holiday pay and vacation
pay, 401(k) plan coverage, employee stock purchase or other incentive plans,
dependent care or severance benefits. Each Continuing Employee shall be given
credit, for purposes of any service requirements for participation or vesting,
for his or her period of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
credited under a similar plan prior to the Effective Time. Each Continuing
Employee who, at the Effective Time, was participating in an employee group
health plan maintained by Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
terminated by Parent shall not be excluded from Parents employee group
health plan or limited in coverage thereunder by reason of any waiting period
restriction or pre-existing condition limitation; _provided, however_ , that
Section 7.14 nothing in this Section 7.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any such health or welfare benefit at any time, and Section 7.15 if
Parent or any Surviving Corporation terminates any of Surviving
Corporations health or welfare benefit plans, then the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate in Parents health and welfare benefit plans,
to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent.
Nothing in this Section 7.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, and the employment of
each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment, if permitted under
applicable law.



(b) The Company agrees that it will take all necessary actions to cause its
401(k) plan, or any other 401(k) plan that it sponsors or maintains for the
benefit of any of the Company employees, to be terminated or frozen prior to
the Effective Time, or merged, as of or as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time into the appropriate qualified plan of Parent, as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion.

promptly prepare and submit to The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. a listing
application or other notice covering the shares of Parent Common Stock

Effective Time, approval (if required) for the listing of such Parent Common
Stock, subject to official notice of issuance.

Corporation to pay severance benefits to Company employees who are terminated
after the Closing Date in accordance with Parents current severance policy
giving credit for service as an employee of the Company. Parents current
severance policy is to pay four weeks salary plus one weeks salary for each
year or portion thereof of employment.



_ SECTION 7.14 Indemnification. _



(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent agrees
that it will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company (when acting in such capacity) determined
as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company
would have been permitted under the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation,
bylaws and other agreements in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such
Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and such other agreements in effect on the date hereof;
_provided, however,_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification).



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 7.14 upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and, provided
that Parent or Surviving Corporation does promptly assume and thereafter
diligently defend such claim, Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and
when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law.



(c) After the date hereof but prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
procure and fund continuing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage for a period not to exceed six years after the Effective Time (the
"Tail Coverage") in an amount and upon terms substantially equivalent, but not
superior, to such insurance of the Company in effect as of the date hereof. In
the event it appears to the Company that the cost to the Company of the
aggregate insurance premiums for the Tail Coverage (the "Insurance Premiums")
will likely exceed the sum of $700,000 plus any amount of credit then
currently available to the Company under the Companys current directors and
officers liability policy (the "Credits"), the Company shall promptly so
notify Parent in writing and Parent shall have twenty-one days from such
notice to attempt to locate Tail Coverage at a lesser cost to the Company,
and, if such less costly coverage is located, it shall be procured and funded
by the Company.



(d) For a period not to exceed six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the Tail Coverage to be procured
by the Company as provided at Section 7.14(d) (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of substantially the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions 

 

43 ##### Table of Contents

  

 which, on the whole, are not less advantageous) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time. Parent
shall not be obligated to keep such insurance in force to the extent the
Insurance Premiums exceed on an annualized basis one hundred seventy-five
percent (175%) of the annualized premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company under the Companys current directors and officers liability policy.



(e) The provisions of this Section 7.14 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and estates. Nothing in this Section shall limit in any way any other
rights to indemnification that any current or former director or officer of
the Company may have by contract or otherwise.



_ SECTION 7.15 The Company Rights Plan._ The Board of Directors of the
Company shall take all action to the extent necessary (including amending the
Company Rights Plan) in order to render the Company Rights Plan inapplicable
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger. Except in
connection with the foregoing sentence, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), amend the Company Rights Plan.



_ SECTION 7.16_ _Parent Rights Agreement_. The Board of Directors of
the Parent shall take all action to the extent necessary (including amending
the Parent Rights Plan) in order to render the Parent Rights Agreement
inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger. Except in connection with the foregoing sentence, the Board of
Directors of the Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), amend the Parent
Rights Agreement.
