Auditor in making such determination being limited to whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Independent Auditor shall make its determination based solely on the presentations and
information provided by Parent or the Majority Equityholders and not by independent review. The Independent Auditor&#146;s determination as to the resolution of the differences and the resulting amount of Company Bookings shall be in writing and
Parent and the Majority Equityholders shall direct the Independent Auditor to furnish such determination to Parent and the Majority Equityholders as promptly as practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the Independent Auditor

the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Majority Equityholders, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Majority Equityholders, on the other
