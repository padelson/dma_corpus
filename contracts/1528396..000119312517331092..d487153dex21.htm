Continuing Employee (other than a Deferred Merger Consideration Employee) is
entitled to receive in respect of any shares of Company Restricted Stock held
by such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.6(a)(v)_ shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms, repurchase
options or obligations, risk of forfeiture and other conditions) set forth in
the applicable Company Option Plan and any applicable stock restriction
agreement or other applicable agreement or plan to which such Company
Restricted Stock is subject as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any
such agreements and ancillary documents between the Company and such
Continuing Employee will remain in effect and, in conjunction with the
applicable Company Option Plan or such other agreement or plan pursuant to
which such Company Restricted Stock 

 



30  was issued, will continue to govern the treatment of the Parent Shares
and/or cash issuable hereunder in respect of such Company Restricted Stock
after the Effective Time. With respect to any cash that remains subject to
restrictions, such cash shall be held back by Parent until such restrictions
lapse in accordance with their terms, at which such time Parent shall pay
promptly and release such cash to the applicable Continuing Employee. With
respect to any Parent Shares that remain subject to restrictions pursuant to
this _Section 2.6(c)_, except to the extent there is a forfeiture of such
Parent Shares, such Parent Shares shall be treated by Parent and its
Affiliates as issued and outstanding capital stock of Parent, and the
applicable former holder of Company Restricted Stock will be shown as the
record holder, will be entitled to exercise voting rights, and will be
entitled to receive dividends (other than non-taxable stock dividends, which
shall be withheld by Parent and included as part of such Parent Shares subject
to restrictions).

(d)  _Calculation of Consideration; Fractional Shares_. For purposes of
calculating the amount of cash payable and number of Parent Shares issuable
hereunder with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock, the amount of cash
payable with respect to Eligible Company Options and the number of Parent
Shares subject to each Unvested Option assumed or substituted by Parent, as
applicable, including for purposes of calculating their respective portions of
the Escrow Amount, (i) the consideration payable in respect of shares of the
Company Capital Stock held by each Stockholder shall be calculated on a
certificate-by-certificate basis, (ii) the consideration payable in respect of
Company Options shall be calculated on a grant-by-grant basis, and (iii) the
amount of cash to be paid to each Stockholder for each Stock Certificate held
by such Stockholder, and to each holder of an Eligible Company Option for each
such option grant, shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. No fraction of
a Parent Share will be issued by virtue of the First Merger. Any Stockholder
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share shall
instead be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) such fraction by (B) the Parent Share Price,
rounded to the nearest whole cent. All payments to be made by Parent hereunder
shall be without interest.

 

(e) _Deferred Merger Consideration_. Pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(iv)_, each
Deferred Merger Consideration Employee shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange for its shares of Company Common Stock, a portion of the Deferred
Merger Consideration, with the amount to be received by a particular Deferred
Merger Consideration Employee equal to the product of (i) the Deferred Merger
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the Consideration Percentage applicable to
such Deferred Merger Consideration Employee. The Parent Shares received by
Deferred Merger Consideration Employees in accordance with  _Section
2.6(a)(iv)_ shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Deferred
Merger Consideration Agreement and shall be held in a restricted account of
the transfer agent of Parent for the benefit of the Deferred Merger
Consideration Employees at the Effective Time, subject to the possibility of
forfeiture in accordance with the terms of the applicable Deferred Merger
Consideration Agreement. Except to the extent there is a forfeiture of
Deferred Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Deferred Merger Consideration Agreements or pursuant to Parents set-
off rights pursuant to the terms of _Article VII_ hereof, the Parent Shares
constituting Deferred Merger Consideration shall be treated by Parent and its
Affiliates as issued and outstanding capital stock of Parent, and the
applicable Deferred Merger Consideration Employee will be shown as the record
holder, will be entitled to exercise voting rights, and will be entitled
to receive dividends (other than non-taxable stock dividends, which shall be
held in the restricted account described in this _Section 2.6(e)_ and
included as part of the Deferred Merger Consideration), in each case with
respect to the Parent Shares constituting Deferred Merger Consideration.

(f) _Adjustments_. In the event that the Company, at any time or from time to
time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, declares or
pays any dividend on Company Capital Stock payable in Company Capital Stock or
in any right to acquire Company Capital Stock, or effects a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock into a greater number of shares
of Company Capital Stock, or in the event the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Company Capital Stock, then the
amounts payable in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



31 (g) _Valuation of Parent Shares_. For all purposes of this Agreement,
including _Article VII_ , the Parent Shares issuable hereunder, including (i)
the Parent Shares issued with respect to shares of Company Preferred Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ and _Section 2.10(f)_, if applicable, (ii)
the Parent Shares issued to the Deferred Merger Consideration Employees
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(iv)_ and (iii) the Escrow Shares shall be valued
at the Parent Share Price.

 

2.7 _Treatment of Company Options and Company Option Plans_.

 

(a) _Vested Options_. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Vested
Option shall be cancelled as follows: (i) in the case of a Vested Option
having a per share exercise price less than the Per Share Amount (the
"Eligible Company Options"), such Eligible Company Option shall be cancelled
in exchange for the right to receive from the Surviving Company (or Parent)
for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Eligible Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding Tax) in cash equal to (x) the product of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Eligible Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the amount by which the Per Share Amount
exceeds the per share exercise price of such Eligible Company Option (less
the amount of Escrow Cash to be withheld with respect thereto pursuant to
_Section 2.12(a)_ and the portion of the Expense Amount to be withheld with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section 2.12(b)_, subject further, in the case
of Deferred Merger Consideration Employees, to the proviso in _Section
2.6(a)(iv)_); or (ii) in the case of any Vested Option having a per share
exercise price equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount, such Vested
Option shall be cancelled and extinguished without the payment of any
consideration in respect thereof. The aggregate amount paid or payable in
respect of the cancellation of the Eligible Company Options as set forth in
this _Section 2.7_ is referred to herein as the "Option Consideration." The
Option Consideration, less the portion of the Escrow Cash withheld with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ and less the portion of the
Expense Amount to be withheld with respect thereto pursuant to _Section
2.12(b)_, shall be payable to the holders of Eligible Company Options in
accordance with _Section 2.4(d)(ii)_ and _(iii)_.

 

(b) _Unvested Options_. At the Effective Time, except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.7(d)_, each Unvested Option held by a Non-Continuing Employee
shall be cancelled and extinguished without payment of any consideration
therefor. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Option held by a Continuing
Employee who is employed in or otherwise primarily provides services in
the United States shall be converted into and become an option to purchase
Parent Shares, with such conversion effected through Parent: (i) assuming such
Unvested Options; or (ii) replacing such Unvested Options by issuing a
reasonably equivalent replacement stock option to purchase Parent Shares in
substitution therefor under Parents equity compensation plan, in either case
in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement)
of the applicable Company Option Plan and the terms of the stock option
agreement by which each such Unvested Option is evidenced. All rights with
respect to Company Common Stock under Unvested Options assumed or replaced by
Parent shall thereupon be converted into rights under such options with
respect to Parent Shares. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A)
each Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for
Parent Shares; (B) the number of Parent Shares subject to each Unvested
Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Unvested
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of Parent
Shares; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Shares issuable upon
exercise of each Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock
subject to such Unvested

 



32  Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the
Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the Company Option Plan and the
stock option agreement by which such Unvested Option is evidenced, any
restriction on the exercise of any Unvested Option assumed or replaced by
Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term and
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Unvested Option shall otherwise
remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Unvested
Option _; _provided__ , __however__ , that (i) Parents board of directors or
a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Board or any committee thereof with respect to each Unvested Option assumed or
replaced by Parent, (ii) Unvested Options shall be subject to administrative
procedures consistent with those in effect under Parents equity compensation
plan and (iii) in the case of any Unvested Option to which Section 421 of the
Code is intended to apply by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of
the Code (an "Incentive Stock Option"), the exercise price of the option to
purchase Parent Shares, the number of Parent Shares purchasable pursuant to
such option to purchase Parent Shares and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option to purchase Parent Shares shall be determined in order
to comply with Section 424 of the Code and any Unvested Option that is not an
Incentive Stock Option shall be adjusted in a manner to comply with Section
409A of the Code. The "Conversion Ratio" shall be equal to the fraction having
a numerator equal to the Per Share Amount and having a denominator equal to
the Parent Share Price. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Option held by a
Continuing Employee who is employed or primarily provides services outside the
United States shall be cancelled and converted into a reasonably equivalent
award under Parents Cash Long Term Incentive Award Plan, with an aggregate
value equal to (x) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (2) the amount by which the Per Share Amount exceeds the per share
exercise price of such Unvested Option.

(c) _Company Option Plan_. At the Effective Time, if Parent so elects, Parent
may assume the Company Option Plan or merge such Company Option Plan into any
equity incentive plan of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge the
Company Option Plan, then, under such Company Option Plan, Parent shall be
entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable
Law, using the share reserves of such Company Option Plan as of the Effective
Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the
termination of Unvested Options that are assumed or replaced by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards
shall be Parent Shares; (ii) all references in such Company Option Plan to a
number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer
instead to a number of Parent Shares determined by multiplying the number of
referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of Parent
Shares; (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed
to the authority and responsibility of the Board or any committee thereof with
respect to the administration of such Company Option Plan; and (iv) all
awards granted under such Company Option Plan shall be subject to
administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under Parents
equity compensation plan.

 

(d) _Acceleration_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall accelerate the
vesting of all Company Restricted Stock and Company Options held by the
Deferred Merger Consideration Employees (other than any Company Options that
are to be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Merger
Consideration Agreement and the Company Restricted Stock that is issued upon
such exercise) and shall amend the Company Options held by Deferred Merger
Consideration Employees in the manner contemplated by _Schedule 2.7(d)_.
Except for such acceleration and the other acceleration provided for on
_Schedule 2.7(d)_, no Company Option or share of Company Restricted Stock
shall have its vesting accelerate, whether by the terms of the Company Option
Plans, any applicable Company Option or Company Restricted Stock agreement or
grant, or other agreement related thereto, or otherwise, in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Mergers or any other the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
connection with any other event, contingent or otherwise).

 



33 (e) _Other Actions_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, in consultation
with Parent, take all actions that may be necessary (under the Company Option
Plan or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.7_.

 

2.8 _Surrender_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. and Computershare Inc. (the "Paying Agent") to serve (and the
Paying Agent shall serve) as paying agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Sections 2.6_, _2.7(a)_ , and if
applicable, _Section 2.10_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the
extent that any portion of the Merger Consideration (or any other payments
under this Agreement) is subject to any income and/or employment withholding
tax, then Parent shall cause such payments to be disbursed by the Surviving
Company (and the Surviving Company shall cause any such amounts to be
disbursed) through the Companys current payroll system, net of applicable
Tax withholding, to the applicable payees.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Parent will
cause the Paying Agent to send to the holders of Stock Certificates (and in
the case of (i) to Non-Employee Optionholders) (i) a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit N_ (the "Letter of
Transmittal", and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Stock Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, in
accordance with _Section 2.6_ and, if applicable,  _Section 2.10_. Upon
surrender of a Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange, together
with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent (including an Investor Questionnaire
if one was not completed and returned prior to the Closing), the holder of
such Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
payment to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, and in accordance
with,  _Section 2.6_ and, if applicable, _Section 2.10_, and the Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.8_, each Stock Certificate shall be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender such Merger Consideration. If any Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any Merger Consideration, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit, indemnity and bond against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent with respect to
such Stock Certificate.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, MergerCos, the Company, the Surviving Company, the Securityholders
Representative, the Paying Agent nor the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any
Stockholder for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining undistributed to Stockholders immediately prior to
such time as such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Parent free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) The right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to Company Capital Stock and Company Options. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no
further registration of transfers of shares shall thereafter be made on
the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Company for transfer, such Stock Certificates
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
this _Article II_ , subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

 



34 (e) Promptly following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the Surviving Company
all cash, Stock Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to
the Mergers. Any Stockholders who have not complied with _Section 2.8_ prior
to the end of such twelve (12) month period shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) for payment of their respective claims for the right to receive Merger
Consideration.

 

2.9 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) The Company shall comply with all requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL
and shall keep Parent promptly informed of all matters relating thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but only to the
extent required by the DGCL, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time held by any holder who has not voted
in favor of the First Merger and is otherwise entitled to demand, and who
properly demands, to receive payment of the fair value for such shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares,
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted pursuant to _Section 2.6_ into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to
perfect or otherwise effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses its right to demand or
receive such payment, such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, pursuant to  _Section
2.6_ and, if applicable, _Section 2.10_. Each holder of Dissenting Shares,
who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment
thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions).

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice and a copy of any notice of a
Stockholders demand for payment or objection to the First Merger, of any
request to withdraw a demand for payment and of any other instrument delivered
to it pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall have the right to, and after the Closing Parent shall have the right
to, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, or as otherwise required under the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting
Shares, unless such payment or settlement (A) is paid by the Company in full
prior to the Closing, and (B) includes an unconditional, irrevocable and full
release of any and all appraisal, dissenters or similar claims or causes of
action against the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Company, or any Person acting on behalf of any of them, (i)
makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of
the value of the Merger Consideration that otherwise would have been owed in
respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any
Losses in respect of any Dissenting Shares or claims with respect thereto ((i)
and (ii) together "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled to
be indemnified for the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments in accordance
with _Article VII_ hereof.

 



35 2.10 _Company Closing Statement; Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) No more than five (5) and not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the
"Company Closing Statement") setting forth (i) the Companys estimate of the
amount of Company Cash and Company Debt, (ii) an itemized calculation of the
Companys estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, (iii) based
thereon, a calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount, and (iv) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"). The Company Closing Statement shall have been
prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP, applied in accordance with
the same accounting principles, policies, methodologies and procedures used by
the Company in preparing the 2017 Financials (except as otherwise provided in
the definition of Closing Net Working Capital Amount) and such Company Closing
Statement shall present fairly, on a good faith basis, using the Companys
reasonable best efforts to obtain the most current and accurate data
available, the information contained therein as of the Closing Date. Such
Company Closing Statement shall be certified by the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer of the Company as having been prepared in
accordance with the foregoing principles.

(b) The Company shall consider in good faith changes requested by Parent to
the Company Closing Statement. To the extent that the Company Closing
Statement is reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Company Closing Statement,
together with the Statement of Estimated Expenses, the Estimated Change in
Control Payments Statement, and the Estimated Pre-Closing Taxes Statement, in
each case delivered pursuant to _Section 6.5_, shall be used to calculate the
Base Purchase Price payable at Closing; __provided__ that if all or any
portion of the Company Closing Statement, the Statement of Estimated
Expenses, the Estimated Change in Control Payments Statement, or the Estimated
Pre-Closing Taxes Statement, is not reasonably acceptable to Parent or if
there is a manifest error contained therein, then Parent and the Company shall
attempt in good faith to reach an agreement as to the amounts contained in
such statements for purposes of calculating the Base Purchase Price payable at
Closing, and to the extent Parent and the Company cannot reach agreement, the
Companys estimates, with any changes thereto agreed by the Company and
Parent, shall be used for purposes of calculating the Base Purchase Price
payable at Closing. The Closing Adjustment Amount calculated based on the
Company Cash, Company Debt and Closing Net Working Capital Amount that is
used for purposes of calculating the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing
pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be referred to herein as the
"Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount".

 

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall have
delivered to the Securityholders Representative a statement (the "Parent
Closing Statement"), executed by Parent, setting forth Parents calculation of
the following: (i) the amount of Company Cash and Company Debt; (ii) an
itemized calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, and (iii)
based thereon, a calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount (the "Parent
Closing Adjustment Amount"). The Parent Closing Statement shall have been
prepared by Parent in accordance with GAAP, applied in accordance with the
same accounting principles, policies, methodologies and procedures used by the
Company in preparing the 2017 Financials (except as otherwise provided in the
definition of Closing Net Working Capital Amount). If for any reason Parent
fails to deliver the Parent Closing Statement within the time period required
by this _Section 2.10(c)_, the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount shall be
considered for all purposes herein to be the "Final Closing
Adjustment Amount".

(d) If, within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the Parent
Closing Statement, the Securityholders Representative delivers written
notice (the "Disputed Items Notice") to Parent stating that the
Securityholders Representative objects to any items on the Parent Closing
Statement and specifying the basis for such objection in reasonable detail
and setting forth the Securityholders Representatives proposed modifications
to the Parent Closing Statement, the Securityholders Representative and
Parent will attempt to resolve and finally determine and agree upon the
Closing Adjustment Amount as promptly as practicable. If the Securityholders
Representative does

 



36  not deliver the Disputed Items Notice to Parent within thirty (30) days
after the date of delivery of the Parent Closing Statement, the Parent Closing
Adjustment Amount will be conclusively presumed to be true and correct in all
respects and will be final and binding upon the parties.

(e) If the Securityholders Representative delivers a Disputed Items Notice
in accordance with _Section 2.10(d)_, the Securityholders Representative and
Parent will attempt in good faith to resolve the disputed items. If the
Securityholders Representative and Parent are unable to agree upon the
disputed items within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Disputed Items
Notice, the Securityholders Representative and Parent will engage an
independent, nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
the Securityholders Representative and Parent (in either case, the
"Accounting Firm") to resolve the disputed items specified in the Disputed
Items Notice. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert, and not an arbiter,
and shall address only the disputed items set forth in the Disputed Items
Notice and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value claimed for
such item by either party or smaller than the smallest value claimed for
such item by either party. Each of the Securityholders Representative and
Parent may submit to the Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other
party on the same day), within fifteen (15) days after the date of engagement
of the Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits)
setting forth their respective positions on any disputed items. Each of the
Securityholders Representative and Parent may submit to the Accounting Firm
(with a copy delivered to the other party hereto on the same day), within
forty-five (45) days after the date of the engagement of the Accounting Firm,
a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the Accounting
Firm by the other party. The Accounting Firm will (i) resolve the disputed
items specified in the Disputed Items Notice and (ii) determine the Closing
Adjustment Amount, as modified only by the resolution of such items. The
determination of the Accounting Firm will be made within sixty (60) days
after being selected and will be final and binding upon the parties. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne by the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders), on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other, in inverse proportion as each party may
prevail (based on the disputed items as resolved by the Accounting Firm as
compared to the disputed items proposed by such party), as determined by
the Accounting Firm, or, if the Accounting Firm determines that neither party
could be fairly found to be the prevailing party, then such fees, costs and
expenses will be borne and paid 50% by the Securityholders Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders) and 50% by Parent. The Closing Adjustment Amount,
as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_, _Section 2.10(d)_ or
this _Section 2.10(e)_, shall be referred to herein as the "Final
Closing Adjustment Amount".

(f) In the event that the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Final Closing Adjustment Amount (the amount of such excess, the "Closing
Adjustment Amount Overpayment"), the Closing Adjustment Amount Overpayment
shall be owed to Parent, and Parent shall be entitled to recover an amount
equal to the Closing Adjustment Amount Overpayment from the Escrow Amount.
The Securityholders Representative and Parent shall execute a joint
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release an
amount equal to such excess within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and the Escrow Agent
shall make the payment of such amounts to Parent within five (5) Business Days
of its receipt of such joint instruction. If the Escrow Amount is not
sufficient to satisfy the amount of the Closing Adjustment Amount
Overpayment, then Parent shall be entitled to recover any shortfall directly
from the Indemnifying Parties, in each case with respect to their Pro Rata
Portion of such shortfall, and each such Indemnifying Party shall promptly,
and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice of
its obligation with respect to such amount, wire transfer to Parent an amount
of cash equal to the amount so owed by such Indemnifying Party. In the event
that the Final Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount (the amount of such excess, the "Closing Adjustment Amount
Underpayment"), the Closing Adjustment Amount Underpayment shall be owed to
the Indemnifying Parties in respect of their shares of Company Capital Stock
(other than Company

 



37  Restricted Stock held by Stockholders other than Deferred Merger
Consideration Employees) and Eligible Company Options. In such case, Parent
shall deliver, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the
Final Closing Adjustment Amount, cash and Parent Shares to the Paying Agent
and, in the case of the holders of Eligible Company Options who are not Non-
Employee Optionholders, the Surviving Company, who shall disburse within five
(5) Business Days of its receipt thereof such amount to the Indemnifying
Parties in accordance with each such Persons Pro Rata Portion (with the
amount payable to each Person to be paid in the same mix of cash and
stock payable to such Person at the Closing in accordance with clauses (ii)
through (iv) of _Section 2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.7(a)_, and with the Parent
Shares to be so distributed valued at the Parent Share Price).

 

(g) The Securityholders Representative and its accountants, lawyers and
representatives will, upon reasonable advance notice, be given reasonable
access to (and, subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in
_Section 6.3_, shall be allowed to make copies of) the relevant financial
Books and Records, in each case in connection with the determination of the
Final Closing Adjustment Amount in accordance with this _Section 2.10._

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes
of determining the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and the Closing Adjustment
Amount Overpayment or Closing Adjustment Amount Underpayment, as the case may
be, the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.10_, and not those set forth
in _Article VII_ , shall control.

2.11 _Withholding_. Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, such amounts
that are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law, and the recipient of any such
payment shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the applicable
withholding agent with all necessary Tax forms, including, without
limitation, an original and duly executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate version
of IRS Form W-8, as applicable. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

2.12 _Escrow Account; Expense Amount_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount in
an escrow account with the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account"), which amounts
shall not become payable as of the Closing Date but shall instead be paid in
accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, _Article VII_ hereof and
the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall constitute partial security for
the purchase price adjustments under _Section 2.10_ and the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under _Article VII_ and shall be
available as a source of recovery for Parent Indemnified Parties for Losses
for which they are entitled to be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to
_Article VII_. The Escrow Amount shall be withheld from the amounts payable to
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to clauses (ii) through (iv) of  _Section
2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.7(a)_, and with respect to each Indemnifying Party,
the amount so withheld will equal such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion
of the Escrow Value. The amounts withheld with respect to shares of Company
Preferred Stock shall be comprised of cash and Parent Shares, with the amount
so withheld to be in the same mix as the amounts payable with respect to the
Per Share Preferred Cash Amount and Per Share Preferred Stock Amount
(with the Parent Shares valued at the Parent Share Price). The amounts
withheld with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock and Eligible Options
held by Deferred Merger Consideration Employees will be withheld from the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such Deferred Merger
Consideration Employees pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(iv)_ and _Section
2.7(a)_. Parent shall pay all of the

 



38  fees and expenses associated with the hiring and retention of the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow and shall be available to
satisfy the indemnification obligations described in _Article VII_. Except to
the extent forfeited in connection with an indemnity claim pursuant to
_Article VII_ , the Parent Shares transferred to the Escrow Account shall be
treated by Parent and its Affiliates as issued and outstanding capital stock
of Parent, and the applicable Indemnifying Party will be shown as the record
holder, will be entitled to exercise voting rights, and will be entitled to
receive dividends (other than non-taxable stock dividends, which shall be
withheld by Parent and included as part of the Escrow Account), in each case
with respect to such Parent Shares. Parent shall be treated as owner of cash
in the Escrow Account for Tax purposes prior to disbursement and that all
interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of
such cash in the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for
tax purposes as earned by Parent provided that the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to distribute to Parent (i) within thirty (30) days
after the end of each quarter, and (ii) upon any final release of cash held in
the Escrow Fund, an amount equal to forty five (45) percent of all interest or
other taxable income earned on the Escrow Fund during such quarter (for
purposes of clause (i)) or during the portion of the year ending on the date
of release (for purposes of clause (ii)), as applicable. It is intended that
the cash in the Escrow Account will qualify for installment sale reporting
under Section 453 of the Code. Subject to _Section 7.5_, any payments to be
made out of the Escrow Account for the benefit of the Stockholders shall be
made to the Paying Agent who shall disburse such amounts to such Stockholders
in accordance with each such Stockholders Pro-Rata Portion of such payments
and any payments to be made out of the Escrow Account for the benefit of
holders of Eligible Company Options shall be made to the Surviving Company
which shall disburse such amounts to the holders of Eligible Company Options
in accordance with each such holders Pro-Rata Portion.

 

(b) Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall deposit, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, the Expense Amount to the Securityholders
Representative, which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or
reimbursing the Securityholders Representative for, any third party expenses
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto. The Expense
Amount shall be withheld from the cash portion of the amounts payable to
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to clauses (ii) through (iv) of _Section
2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.7(a)_, and with respect to each Indemnifying Party,
the amount so withheld will equal such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion
of the Expense Amount. The Indemnifying Parties will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Expense Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to
the Securityholders Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Securityholders
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense
Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Securityholders Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or
any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Securityholders
Representatives responsibilities, the Securityholders Representative will
deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Amount to the Paying Agent and
the Surviving Company, as applicable, for further distribution to the
Indemnifying Parties. For tax purposes, the Expense Amount will be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Parties at
the time of Closing.

 

2.13 _Tax Consequences_. The First Merger and the Second Merger together are
intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3 (the "Intended Tax Treatment"). The parties to this Agreement
shall prepare all Returns consistent with the foregoing Intended Tax Treatment
and shall not take any Tax position which is inconsistent with the Intended
Tax Treatment, unless (a) there is a contrary assessment or determination
made by a Tax Authority upon audit or (b) there is a Reporting Exception
Event. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Reporting Exception Event" means any
of the following: (i) a change in 

 



39  applicable Law after the date hereof, (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.11(b)(xx)_, (iii)
existence of Dissenting Shares, (iv) payment of consideration pursuant to
this Agreement in a manner inconsistent with _Schedule 2.13_ or (v) a
modification of this Agreement described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(2)(ii)(B) in each case that Parent reasonably determines, after
consultation with (A) its nationally recognized Tax advisors and (B) the
Company, before the Closing, or the Securityholders Representative, after the
Closing, does not permit Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to file a Return or otherwise take a Tax position consistent with
the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

2.14 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the
Second Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the First Step-Surviving Company, then the
officers and directors of the Surviving Company are hereby authorized,
empowered and directed in the name of and on behalf of the First Step-
Surviving Company to execute and deliver any and all things and to take such
action as is necessary or desirable to vest or to perfect or confirm title to
such property or rights in the Surviving Company, and otherwise to carry out
the purposes and provisions of this Agreement.

The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and MergerCos,

schedule (which disclosure shall reference the appropriate section and
subsection numbers of this _Article III_ to which such exceptions apply,
__provided__ , __however__ , that any disclosures made therein shall apply to
any other section or subsection without repetition where it is reasonably
clear on the face of such disclosure, without any independent knowledge on the
part of the reader regarding the matter disclosed, that the disclosure is
intended to apply to such other section or subsection), supplied by the
Company to Parent and MergerCos and dated as of the date hereof (the
"Disclosure Schedule"), on the date hereof and as of the Closing, as though

Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or other
appropriate form of local jurisdiction entity to do business, and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character or location of its assets or
properties (whether owned, leased or licensed) or the nature of its activities
make such qualification or licensing necessary to the Companys business as
currently conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists the directors and
officers of each Company Entity as of the date hereof.

 



40 (c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true, correct and

3.2 _Company Capital Structure_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000

or repurchased (in the case of shares that were outstanding and repurchased
by the Company or any stockholder of the Company) in compliance with all
applicable Laws, including federal and state securities Laws, and were issued,
transferred and repurchased (in the case of shares that were outstanding and
repurchased by the Company or any stockholder) in accordance with any right of
first refusal, preemptive right, or similar right or limitation to which the
Company is a party, including those in the Charter Documents of the Company. 

(c) Except for the Company Option Plans, the Company has never adopted,
sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other plan, arrangement

complete copies of all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under
the Company Option Plans have been made available to Parent, and such
agreements and instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented,
and there are no agreements to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or
instruments from the forms thereof or agreements made

 



41  available to Parent. Other than the Company Options, there is no outstanding
or authorized stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit
participation, or other similar right with respect to the Company, or any
Contract to grant or issue any of the foregoing. The Company has reserved
7,175,465 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance under the Company Option
Plans as of the date hereof, of which, as of the date hereof (i) 3,808,375
Company Options are outstanding, (ii) 3,019,500 shares have been issued upon
the exercise of Company Options granted under the Company Option Plan, (iii)
2,329,500 shares have been issued in the form of restricted stock granted

contained in such Lease Agreements.

Entity, as applicable, is in material compliance with the applicable license
terms with respect thereto. The Company does not distribute any Company

parties (other than the Securityholders Representative) agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any Transfer Taxes. The party

prescribed by applicable Law.

 

6.8 _Tax Matters Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Securityholders Representative shall cooperate fully with Parent in
connection with the filing of Returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon Parents request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees or representatives available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder or to participate in proceedings with respect to Taxes. In the
event any Stockholder, the Securityholders Representative, or Parent
receives notice of any proposed audit, claim, assessment or other dispute
concerning Pre-Closing Taxes (each a "Tax Contest"), they shall promptly
notify Parent or the Securityholders Representative, as applicable, of such
matter. Parent shall not settle any Tax Contest without the Securityholders
Representatives prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall ensure (after the Closing) the Company
retains all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the
respective taxable periods, and abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Tax Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
any provisions of this _Section 6.8_ conflict with _Article VII_ , the
provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall control.

(b) Following the Closing Date, prior to Parent making any claim for
indemnification in respect of Reserved Taxes, each of Parent, the Company
Entities and the Securityholders Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and Securityholders Representative shall cooperate fully
with Parent, to obtain reimbursement of any amount of Reserved Taxes from the
Company Entities applicable customers that are required to reimburse a
Company Entity for such amounts; provided, that none of Parent, the Company
Entities or any of their Affiliates shall have any further obligation to seek
reimbursement for any Reserved Taxes after 60 days following the closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts so reimbursed from a customer (net of
reasonable expenses in connection therewith) shall reduce the amount of Losses
subject to indemnification in respect of Reserved Taxes.

 

6.9 _Preparation of Returns_. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed all Returns for the Company Entities
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date and all such Returns shall be prepared consistent with past
practice except as otherwise required by any applicable Law. Parent shall
provide each such income or other material Return to the Securityholders
Representative that reflects a Tax for which the Indemnifying Parties could be
liable no later than twenty (20) days prior to filing and, in the case of any
other material Return prepared by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ that
reflects a Tax for which the Indemnifying Parties could be liable, as soon as
reasonably practicable, for the Securityholders Representatives review and
comment, and Parent shall consider any such comments in good faith prior to
filing such Returns. Parent and the Company shall cooperate as necessary to
effect the filing of any such Return.

 



82 6.10 _Apportionment_. With respect to Taxes of the Company Entities relating
to a Tax period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the amount of Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined consistent with the following: (A) in the case
of income Taxes and all other Taxes that are not imposed on a periodic basis,
the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes shall be deemed to be the amount that would be
payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date based on an
interim closing of the books (and, for such purposes, the taxable period of
any partnership or other pass-through entity or any "controlled foreign
corporation" within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code in which the
Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time), except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions), other
than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing, shall be
allocated on a per diem basis and (B) in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Pre-Closing Taxes shall be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar days from the beginning
of the Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which shall be the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period.

6.11  _Certain Post-Closing Tax Actions_. Without the prior written consent
of the Securityholders Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not and,
following the Closing, shall cause each Company Entity to not (i) make,
change or rescind any material Tax election of a Company Entity with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) amend any Return of the Company Entities
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) file any Return of the Company Entities
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction in which
such Company Entity did not file previously (other than a Return with an
original due date (taking into account extensions) after the Closing Date
filed in a jurisdiction that Parent reasonably believes the applicable Company
Entity is required to file in, which Return, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall be subject to _Section 6.9_), (iv) engage in any voluntary disclosure
or similar process with a Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes or
Returns of the Company Entities in each case for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
(v) extend the statute of limitations with respect to any Tax of a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, in each case that would reasonably be expected to have the effect
of increasing the Tax liability of any Company Entity in respect of any Pre-
Closing Tax Period with respect to which the Indemnifying Parties are liable
under this Agreement. 

6.12 _Repayment of Company Debt_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company
shall have taken all actions necessary for the repayment or prepayment of all
of the Company Debt listed on _Schedule 6.12_, including the obtaining of any
required Payoff Letters and making all appropriate arrangements for the
prepayment or repayment thereof (including the preparation of all
documentation and the provision of all endorsements required or reasonably
necessary therefor, and arranging for the release of all Liens, financing
statements or other security interests relating thereto).

 

6.13 _Termination of Plans_. The Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall, as
applicable, terminate, or cease participation in, effective as of no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, any and all group
severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements
and any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section
401(k) arrangement and any and all Company Employee Plans intended to meet the
requirements of Code Section 125 (each a "Terminated Plan") (unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date that such plans shall not be terminated or
participation shall not be ceased). The Company shall, as applicable, provide
Parent with evidence that the Company no longer participates in
such Terminated Plan(s) or that such Terminated Plan(s) have been terminated
(effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board, or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may
be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other

 



83  actions in furtherance of terminating such Terminated Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require. In the event that termination of any Terminated Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges
or other fees then such charges and/or fees shall be deemed to be Transaction
Expenses, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Parent.

6.14 _Employee Matters_. Within five (5) Business Days of the date of
this Agreement, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall offer each employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary, other than the Key Employees, employment by
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent as a Continuing Employee to be effective on
or after the Closing Date. Such employment will: (i) be set forth in an offer
letter in Parents or the relevant Affiliates modified standard form, (ii) be
subject to compliance with Parents or the relevant Affiliates applicable
policies and procedures, including employment background checks and the
execution of Parents employee proprietary information agreement, (iii) have
terms, including the position and salary, which will be determined by Parent,
(iv) include, if applicable, a waiver by the Employee of any future equity-
based compensation to which such Employee may otherwise have been eligible,
and (v) supersede any prior express or implied employment agreements,
arrangements, representations, or offer letter in effect prior to the Closing
Date. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate the employment or
consulting services of each individual who is a Non-Continuing Employee,
effective as of no later than immediately prior to the Closing. The Company
shall pay all severance pay or benefits (including but not limited to any
acceleration of vesting) to (A) each Non-Continuing Employee who is provided
a Qualifying Offer by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent who does not accept
such Qualifying Offer prior to Closing, (B) each Non-Continuing Employee who
the Company elects to terminate prior to the Closing (and not at the
direction or request of Parent) and (C) each Non-Continuing Employee who has
failed to satisfy Parents customary employee background investigation (such
amounts "Non-Continuing Employee Severance Amounts"). The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain a release reasonably satisfactory to Parent
from each Non-Continuing Employee (it being understood that the Company shall
have no obligation to pay any consent fee, payment or other consideration in
connection with obtaining such release). The term "Non-Continuing Employee
Severance Amounts" shall not include any amounts incurred by any Company
Entity for actions taken with respect to such Non-Continuing Employee at the
direction of the Parent. Any Employee who is provided a Qualifying Offer by
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent who does not accept such Qualifying Offer
prior to the Closing will be terminated by the Company prior to the Closing
and such Employee will be a Non-Continuing Employee and, for the avoidance of
doubt, any severance pay or benefits (including but not limited to any
acceleration of vesting) with respect to such termination shall be deemed
Non-Continuing Employee Severance Amounts. Except to the extent set forth on
_Schedule 6.14_ hereof (which amounts set forth on said _Schedule 6.14_ shall
constitute Non-Continuing Employee Severance Payments), Parent shall pay all
severance pay or benefits (including but not limited to any acceleration of
vesting) to (1) each Non-Continuing Employee who is not provided a Qualifying
Offer by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (except for any such Non-Continuing
Employee described in clauses (B) and (C) above) prior to Closing or any Non-
Continuing Employee who Parent directs or requests the Company to terminate
prior to Closing and (2) each Continuing Employee who accepts a Qualifying
Offer by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent and is terminated or resigns
following the Closing, and the foregoing amounts in (1) and (2) shall not
constitute Non-Continuing Employee Severance Amounts.

6.15 _Indemnification of Covered Persons_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or
former directors (including their directors, officers, partners, employees,
agents, spouses and controlling Persons), officers or other employees of the
Company currently indemnified by the Company (collectively, the "Covered
Persons") as provided by statute or in

 



84  the Charter Documents of the Company or the indemnity agreements listed on
_Schedule 6.15(a)_ will survive the transactions contemplated by the terms of
this Agreement and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms for a period of not less than six years from the Closing, and the
Company will honor, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or any
subsequent successor of the Surviving Company to honor, the foregoing
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses obligations of the
Company for acts or omissions by such Covered Persons occurring on or prior to
the Closing.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company will purchase a prepaid directors
and officers liability insurance "run-off policy" with a claims period of six
years from the Closing Date, for the benefit of the Covered Persons with
respect to their acts and omissions as directors, officers and employees of
the Company occurring prior to the Closing (the "DandO Tail Policy"). The costs
of the DandO Tail Policy shall be included in the Transaction Expenses of the
Company. In all cases, and not withstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Covered Persons shall first seek recourse against the
DandO Tail Policy in connection with claims for indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing prior to seeking recourse
against the Company for such indemnification.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.15_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Covered Person, and each such
Persons heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being
expressly agreed that such Persons will be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.15_, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise

 

6.16 _Section 280G Stockholder Approval_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to (a) obtain from each Person who might receive a 280G Payment
(as defined below) an executed waiver that shall provide that if the
requisite stockholder approval under Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (collectively, "Section 280G") is not obtained, no
Section 280G Payment shall be payable to or retained by such disqualified
individual (each, a "280G Waiver"), and (b) submit to the Stockholders for
approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Parent) by such number of
Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
of any payments and/or benefits that may, separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("280G Payments"), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Parent (i) that a vote of the Stockholders was solicited in conformance with
Section 280G, and (ii) either (A) the requisite stockholder approval was
obtained with respect to any 280G Payments that were subject to the
stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or (B) the 280G Approval was not
obtained and, as a consequence, that such 280G Payments shall not be made or
provided pursuant to the 280G Waivers. All materials and waivers to be
submitted to the Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 6.16_ shall be

no obligation to pay any modification fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration, including increased rent payments or other payments under the

connection with obtaining a Required Modification, unless the express terms
of any such Contract contain such an obligation. In the event the First Merger

Company, the Stockholders or any other Person for any costs, claims,
Liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such

guaranty) in connection with terminating such Contract, unless the express
terms of any such Contract contain such an obligation. In the event the First
Merger does not close for any reason, Parent shall not have any Liability to
the Company, the Stockholders or any other Person for any costs, claims,
Liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such
terminations unless otherwise expressly provided for in the Contract.

_Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Indemnified Parties with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than (1) in the case
of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct against the
Person that committed such fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct or who had actual knowledge of such fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, or (2) specific performance or other
injunctive relief; __provided__ , that the foregoing shall not limit the
remedies available to parties under any Related Agreements. Notwithstanding
anything that may be deemed to be to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing in this _Article VII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
limit the liability of any Person or the remedies available to the Parent
Indemnified Parties in respect of Losses arising out of, or shall bar
any action against such Person (and nothing herein shall serve as a defense
thereto) in relation to, any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct committed by such Person (or if such Person had actual knowledge of
such fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct committed by
any other Person) of or in relation to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; __provided__ , __however__ , that no Person shall be
liable or otherwise responsible for any fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or willful misconduct committed by any other Person, except pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(v)_ or any such fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct of which such first Person had actual knowledge.

(e) Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_ above, (i) no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to any Parent Indemnified Party for any Loss hereunder, or with
respect to any amounts payable by such Indemnifying Party in accordance with
_Section 2.10_ with respect to any Closing Adjustment Amount Overpayment, in
excess of such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such Loss or amount;
and (ii) the maximum liability of each Indemnifying Party for Losses hereunder
and with respect to any amounts payable by such Indemnifying Party in
accordance with  _Section 2.10_ with respect to any Closing Adjustment
Amount Overpayment, shall be the portion of the Merger Consideration actually
received by such Indemnifying Party with respect to shares of Company Capital
Stock (excluding Company Restricted Stock held by Stockholders other than
Deferred Merger Consideration Employees) and Eligible Company Options pursuant
to _Section 2.6_, _Section 2.7(a)_ and, if applicable, _Section 2.10_ with
respect to any Closing Adjustment Amount Overpayment (inclusive, without
duplication, of any portion of the Escrow Amount and Expense Amount actually
received by such Indemnifying Party and amounts actually received or
receivable pursuant to the Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement). Parent
shall have the right to set-off any Losses that are recoverable hereunder from
the Indemnifying Parties directly from the Deferred Merger Consideration that
becomes or could become vested with respect to any Deferred Merger
Consideration Employee pursuant to the applicable Deferred Merger
Consideration Agreement, subject to the limitations on indemnification set
forth in this _Article VII_.

 

(f) The right to indemnification based on representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations in this Agreement will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of
or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based on
such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

 



94 (g) The obligations of the Indemnifying Parties to indemnify any Parent
Indemnified Party for any Loss hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of
any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements actually received by the Indemnified Parties from any third
parties other the Indemnifying Parties (which in each case shall be
calculated net of all costs, expenses, deductibles, co-payments, retro premium
obligations and premium increases attributable thereto, and all costs of
collection of any such proceeds) in respect of such Losses. In the event that
Parent shall put in place a representation and warranty insurance policy as
contemplated by _Section 7.3(a)_ covering the provisions of this Agreement,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover Losses from such
policy to the extent that the policy covers such Losses.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any claim for recovery for any
Loss related to or arising from (i) the amount or availability of any Tax
asset or attribute of any Company Entity, (ii) the ability of any Parent
Indemnified Party to utilize any Tax asset or attribute of any Company Entity
following the Closing, or (iii) any Taxes imposed on any Company Entity
arising from any breach of a representation or warranty contained in 
_Section 3.11_ ( _Taxes_ ) for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing (other than any such Losses resulting from a
breach of the representations set forth in _Sections 3.11(b)(xi)_, 
_3.11(b)(xiii)_ , _3.11(b)(xiv)_ , _3.11(b)(xix))_.

(i) Subject to _Section 7.3(k)_, a Parent Indemnified Party may assert a
claim for indemnification based on or arising out of the same set of facts and
circumstances under more than one provision of _Section 7.2(a)_, and a Parent
Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed or limited from recovering under
one or more such applicable provisions an amount of Losses that such Parent
Indemnified Party would not be entitled to recover under another applicable
provision due to the application of a survival period, basket, or other
limitation on such other applicable provision that differs from, or does not
apply to, the first applicable provision.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages
pursuant to this _Article VII_ , unless such punitive or exemplary damages
were awarded to a third Person by a Governmental Authority pursuant to a
Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Parties were entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to double recovery for (i) any Losses
based on or arising out of the same set of facts or circumstances under more
than one claim for indemnification regardless of whether such facts or
circumstances would give rise to multiple bases for indemnification, and (ii)
any amounts expressly included or resolved in the determination of the Base
Purchase Price or the Final Closing Adjustment Amount.

 

7.4 _Third Party Claims; Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts;
Mitigation_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In the event that Parent becomes aware of a third
party claim (each, a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes
may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ ,
Parent shall notify the Securityholders Representative of such claim, and the
Securityholders Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, at the sole option and the expense of the Indemnifying
Parties, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of
such Third Party Claim; __provided__ , __however__ , that Securityholders

 



95  Representative shall not have the ability, without the prior written consent
of Parent, to petition, make any motion to, or take any other procedural
action in connection with such Third Party Claim by or before any
Governmental Authority. The failure to so notify the Securityholders
Representative shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties of any Liability,
except to the extent the Securityholders Representative demonstrates that
the defense of such Third Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of, and to settle, any Third Party Claim, in each case, in a
commercially reasonable manner; __provided__ , __however__ , that Parent
shall provide the Securityholders Representative at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior written notice of any proposed settlement of any such
Third Party Claim requesting the consent of the Securityholders
Representative with respect to such proposed settlement, and in the event that
the consent of the Securityholders Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) is not obtained, no settlement of any such
claim with third-party claimants will be determinative of the amount of Losses
relating to such matter, __provided__ _,_ _ _further__ , __however__ , the
consent of the Securityholders Representative with respect to any settlement
of any such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the
Securityholders Representative shall have objected within fifteen (15)
Business Days after a written request for such consent by Parent. In the
event that the Securityholders Representative has consented to or is deemed
to have consented to any such settlement, and notwithstanding any provisions
to the contrary herein (including the objection and dispute provisions set
forth in _Section 7.4_ hereof), the costs of defense of such Third Party
Claim and the amount of such settlement (collectively, the "Agreed Settlement
Amount") shall be deemed indemnifiable Losses hereunder, and neither the
Securityholders Representative nor the Indemnifying Parties shall have any
power or authority to object under any provision of this _Article VII_ (or
otherwise) to the right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to recover the
amount of any Agreed Settlement Amount. The Securityholders Representative
shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with the third-party claimant with respect to the Third Party
Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Securityholders
Representative does not adversely affect the attorney client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other privilege relating to the Parent
Indemnified Parties.

(b) _Procedure for Claims_. In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party
wishes to assert a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ , then
Parent (on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party) shall deliver to the
Securityholders Representative and the Escrow Agent (if recovery is to be
sought from the Escrow Account) a certificate (a "Claim Certificate") (i)
stating that a Parent Indemnified Party has suffered, sustained, or incurred,
or reasonably anticipates that it may suffer, sustain, or incur, Losses, and
(ii) specifying in reasonable detail the basis for the claim(s), as well as
the Losses relating thereto (which, if not determinable at such time, may be a
reasonable good faith estimate thereof) (the aggregate amount of such Losses
in a Claim Certificate being referred to as the "Claimed Amount"). Parent
shall make reasonably available to the Securityholders Representative backup
materials supporting, and other materials reasonably relevant to assessing the
validity of, the claims asserted in any Claim Certificate reasonably
requested by the Securityholders Representative, it being understood and
agreed that Parent shall have no obligation to provide any materials to the
extent that (1) any Law requires Parent to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such materials or (2) access to such materials would give
rise to a risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other privilege applicable to such materials. Except in the case of a Claim
Certificate for an Agreed Settlement Amount, as to which the Securityholders
Representative shall have no right to object. The Securityholders
Representative shall have fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of a Claim
Certificate to deliver to Parent and the Escrow Agent (if applicable) a
certificate (an "Objection Certificate"), pursuant to which the
Securityholders Representative shall, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties:
(A) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the
Claimed Amount (in which case, the Securityholders Representative and Parent
shall execute a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal to
the Claimed Amount, __provided__ that, if the Claimed Amount exceeds the
amount remaining in the Escrow

 



96  Account and the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery in
excess of such amount hereunder for such Claimed Amount, or if Claimed Amount
relates to a claim for recovery directly from the Indemnifying Parties that
is permitted hereunder, each such Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice of its
indemnification obligation with respect to such amount, wire transfer to
Parent an amount of cash equal to, the amount so owed by such Indemnifying
Party with respect to the Claimed Amount in accordance with the terms hereof,
(B) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part,
but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case, the
Securityholders Representative and Parent shall execute a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Agreed Amount
__provided__ that, if the Agreed Amount exceeds the amount remaining in the
Escrow Account and the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery in
excess of such amount hereunder for such Claimed Amount, or if the Agreed
Amount relates to a claim for recovery directly from the Indemnifying Parties
that is permitted hereunder, each such Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written notice
of its indemnification obligation with respect to such amount, wire transfer
to Parent an amount of cash equal to the amount so owed by such Indemnifying
Party with respect to the Agreed Amount in accordance with the terms hereof),
or (C) contest that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of
the Claimed Amount and specify, in reasonable detail, any objections to the
claims in such Claim Certificate or the Claimed Amount. If the
Securityholders Representative fails to deliver an Objection Certificate
within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a Claim Certificate, then
the Securityholders Representative shall be deemed, for and on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, to agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive all of the Claimed Amount (which deemed agreement shall be deemed
final, binding and conclusive with respect to all of the Indemnifying
Parties) (in which case, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to the Claimed Amount, __provided__ that, if the
Claimed Amount exceeds the amount remaining in the Escrow Account, and the
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery in excess of such amount
hereunder for such Claimed Amount, or if Claimed Amount relates to a claim for
recovery directly from the Indemnifying Parties that is permitted hereunder,
each such Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days after receipt of notice of its indemnification obligation
with respect to such amount, wire transfer to Parent an amount of cash equal
to the amount so owed by such Indemnifying Party with respect to the Claimed
Amount in accordance with the terms hereof). In the event Parent delivers a
Claim Certificate for an Agreed Settlement Amount, the Securityholders
Representative and Parent shall execute a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to the Agreed Settlement Amount, provided that, if the
Agreed Settlement Amount exceeds the amount remaining in the Escrow Account
and the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery in excess of such
amount hereunder for such Agreed Settlement Amount, or if the Agreed
Settlement Amount relates to a claim for recovery directly from the
Indemnifying Parties that is permitted hereunder, each such Indemnifying
Party shall promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of notice of its indemnification obligation with respect to such
amount, wire transfer to Parent an amount of cash equal to, the amount so
owed by such Indemnifying Party with respect to the Agreed Settlement Amount
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(c)  _Resolution of Conflicts_.

(i) In the event the Securityholders Representative shall timely deliver
an Objection Certificate, then for a period of thirty (30) days after
delivery of such Objection Certificate, the Securityholders Representative
and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims objected to in the
Objection Certificate. If the Securityholders Representative and Parent
should reach agreement with respect to such Objection Certificate, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Account, such

 



97  memorandum shall be promptly delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Escrow
Agent shall pay to Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the
Losses so agreed, _provided_ that, if the agreed amount exceeds the amount
remaining in the Escrow Account and the Parent Indemnified Parties are
entitled to recovery in excess of such amount hereunder for such Claimed
Amount, or if the agreed amount relates to a claim for recovery directly from
the Indemnifying Parties that is permitted hereunder, each such Indemnifying
Party shall promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of notice of its indemnification obligation with respect to such
amount, wire transfer to, Parent an amount of cash equal to, the amount so
owed by such Indemnifying Party with respect to the agreed amount in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(ii) Should Parent and the Securityholders Representative be unable to agree
as to any particular item or items or amount or amounts specified in an
Objection Certificate within the time periods specified in _Section
7.4(c)(i)_, then the Parent Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit
such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with 
_Section 9.6_. Upon resolution of such dispute, or receipt of a final non-
appealable order or determination from a court of competent jurisdiction
setting forth the resolution of such dispute, then, the Escrow Agent shall
pay to Parent from the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the Losses so
determined, __provided__ that, if the amount of such Losses exceeds the amount
remaining in the Escrow Account and the Parent Indemnified Parties are
entitled to recovery in excess of such amount hereunder for such Claimed
Amount, or if the Losses relate to a claim for recovery directly from the
Indemnifying Parties that is permitted hereunder, each such Indemnifying Party
shall promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of notice of its indemnification obligation with respect to such
amount, wire transfer to Parent an amount of cash equal to, the amount so owed
by such Indemnifying Party with respect to the Losses in accordance with the
terms hereof

(d) In the event that an Indemnifying Party fails to pay to Parent, if
and when due, any amounts directly owed by such Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this Article VII, then such Indemnifying Party shall reimburse Parent for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent to enforce
the recovery from the Indemnifying Party of the amounts so owed.

 

7.5 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow_. From and after the Closing, the Escrow Account shall be
available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties for all Losses in
respect of which such Parent Indemnified Parties may be indemnified under this
_Article VII_.

(b) _Satisfaction of Claims from the Escrow Account_. For so long as any
portion of the Escrow Amount remains in the Escrow Account with the Escrow
Agent, and except in the case of any claim against any Indemnified Party with
respect to any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct
committed by such Indemnifying Party or of which such Indemnifying Party had
actual knowledge, the Parent Indemnified Parties will recover any Losses
recoverable under this _Article VII_ from the Escrow Account first, and shall
not recover any Losses directly from the Indemnifying Parties until the Escrow
Amount is exhausted or has been released to the Indemnifying Parties. Each
claim for Losses that is to be satisfied from the Escrow Account pursuant to
this _Article VII_ shall be satisfied by delivery to Parent, on behalf of the
applicable Parent Indemnified Parties, of Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash in an
amount equal to such Losses. The amount of Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash
to be used to satisfy each such claim shall be determined by reference to
each Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the amount to be so delivered
and, as to each Indemnifying Party, out of such Indemnifying Partys Escrow
Shares and/or Escrow Cash in the same proportion as was withheld from such
Person and contributed to the Escrow Account in accordance with _Section
2.12(a)_.

 



98 (c) _Distribution Following Termination of Escrow Periods_. Any amounts
remaining in the Escrow Account on the date that is eighteen (18) months from
the Closing Date (less any amount of actual Losses or Losses estimated by
Parent in good faith (i) in respect of any resolved claims for indemnification
that have yet to be paid to the Parent Indemnified Parties or (ii) which may
reasonably be required to satisfy any unresolved and pending claims specified
in any Claim Certificate based on the facts and circumstances existing at the
expiration of such 18-month period ("Unresolved Claims")) shall be released by
the Escrow Agent on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release Date") to (i)
the Surviving Company (for further distribution to the holders of Eligible
Company Options which are not Non-Employee Optionholders) and (ii) the
Paying Agent (for distribution to the Stockholders and Non-Employee
Optionholders), in each case, in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_ and the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event that there exist Unresolved
Claims, as soon as any such Unresolved Claim has been resolved and, if
applicable, satisfied, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the resolution and/or satisfaction of
such Unresolved Claim, deliver in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_ and the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the portion of the Escrow Account that is not
being retained in respect of all other remaining Unresolved Claims.

 

(d) _Delivery of Escrow Amount to Indemnifying Parties_. Delivery of Escrow
Shares or Escrow Cash to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Section
7.5_ shall be made based on each Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the
amount to be so delivered. The amounts to be so delivered to each Indemnifying
Party shall be made in the form of Escrow Shares and/or Escrow Cash in the
same proportion as was withheld from such Person and contributed to the Escrow
Account in accordance with _Section 2.12(a)_. The amount of any Escrow Cash
to be so delivered to any Indemnifying Party shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole cent, and the number of Escrow Shares so delivered to any
Indemnifying Party shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent
Shares. Any Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash remaining after such rounding shall
be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties in an equitable manner, as
determined in good faith by the Surviving Company and taking into account the
Indemnifying Parties respective Pro Rata Portion, and in connection therewith
the Surviving Company may direct the Paying Agent to liquidate all or any
portion of such remaining Escrow Shares after such rounding prior to any such
distribution.

(e)  _Instructions to Escrow Agent_. Parent and the Securityholders
Representative hereby agree to deliver any written notices or instructions
requested by the Escrow Agent in order to effectuate any delivery or release
of any portion of the Escrow Amount to Parent, on behalf of the Parent
Indemnified Party, or to the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, that is
to be made in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement.

 

7.6 _Securityholders  Representative_.

 

(a) The Indemnifying Parties hereby irrevocably appoint the Securityholders
Representative as their agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each of
the Indemnifying Parties, in connection with and to facilitate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include the
power and authority:

(i) for the purposes of _Article VII_ , to give and receive notices
and communications, to authorize delivery to any Parent Indemnified Party of
Escrow Cash or Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account in satisfaction of claims
by a Parent Indemnified Party, to object to, consent or agree to (including,
by refraining from consenting or agreeing), negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and bring suit and comply with orders and awards of courts
with respect to claims for indemnification hereunder (whether against the
Escrow Account or directly against the Indemnifying Parties), and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

 



99 (ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby as the Securityholders Representative, in its sole discretion,
may deem necessary or desirable;

 

(iii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Stockholders and
to enforce and protect the rights and interests of all Indemnifying Parties
arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, and any
other document contemplated hereby, and to take any and all actions which the
Securityholders Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under
this Agreement for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties;

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Indemnifying Parties or any
of them and/or the Securityholders Representative arising out of or under or
in any manner relating to this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby;
__provided__ , __however__ , that no such failure to act on the part of the
Securityholders Representative, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the
Securityholders Representative or by the Indemnifying Parties unless such
waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Securityholders
Representative; and

 

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Securityholders
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary
or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all other documents contemplated hereby.

 

(b) The Securityholders Representative may resign upon written notice to
Parent, and the holders of a majority in interest (on an as converted to
Common Stock basis) of the amounts contributed (including cash and Parent
Shares) to the Escrow Account at Closing, shall appoint a successor. The
successor shall be entitled to all the rights, powers, immunities and
privileges as was his or her predecessor, without the need of any further act
or writing. No bond shall be required of the Securityholders Representative.
After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the Securityholders
Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders.

(c) The Securityholders Representative shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder or under any agreements ancillary hereto as
Securityholders Representative while acting in good faith and without gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Securityholders Representative from and against
any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the Securityholders Representatives
execution and performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
__provided__ , that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Securityholders Representative, the Securityholders
Representative will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholders
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such Representative Losses may
be recovered by the Securityholders Representative from (i) the funds in the
Expense Amount and (ii) the

 



100  amounts in the Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Indemnifying Parties; __provided__ , that
while this section allows the Securityholders Representative to be paid from
the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Indemnifying
Parties from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholders
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Securityholders Representative be required to advance
its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying
Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Securityholders Representative
under this _Section 7.6_. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing,
the resignation or removal of the Securityholders Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders
Representative with respect to the matters regarding the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties hereunder, including with respect to
the Escrow Account, shall constitute a decision of all of the Indemnifying
Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive, and the
Parent Indemnified Parties may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholders Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each Indemnifying Party. The Parent Indemnified
Parties are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts
done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Securityholders Representative.

 

(e) Parent, on behalf of all Parent Indemnified Parties, hereby agrees that
any notice, right, or obligation required to be delivered to, performed by,
or asserted by the Indemnifying Parties regarding the Escrow Account shall be
delivered to, performed by or asserted by the Securityholders Representative.

 

7.7 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payments pursuant to this _Article VII_
and _Section 6.7_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law.

9.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually
executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. A facsimile, telecopy, PDF or other reproduction of this Agreement
may be executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party
by facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which
the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen. Any such facsimile,
telecopy, PDF or other reproduction shall be deemed an original. Such
execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for
all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to
execute and deliver an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile,
telecopy or other reproduction hereof.

 

9.3 _Entire Agreement_ ; Assignment. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the
Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Related Agreements
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties
hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof; (b) are not intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as set forth in 
_Section 9.8_; and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of Law or
otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates as long as Parent remains
ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder.

9.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

9.6 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to  _Article VII_ hereof,
each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (unless the
Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, in which case the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware), in connection with
any matter

 



104  based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated
herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized
by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and
covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have
to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. Subject to _Article VII_ hereof,
each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except
in such courts.

9.7 _Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the other party may be
irreparably harmed and that there may be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, including the confidentiality obligations set forth in _Section
6.3_. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or agreements, each
party hereto shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief to restrain a
breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise obtain specific performance of,
the other partys covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. Each
party hereby waives any objections to the appropriateness of the other party
seeking any such remedy referred to in this  _Section 9.7_ (including any
objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at law or that an
award of such remedy is an inappropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not in any way limit a
partys right to object to the substantive merits of any claim. In the
event any party seeks any remedy referred to in this this _Section 9.7_, such
party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or
other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining such a
remedy.

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall inure exclusively to
the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors, assigns, executors and legal representatives. Except (i) as set
forth in  _Section 6.15(c)_ with respect to the Covered Persons, (ii) as set
forth in _Article VII_ with respect to Parent Indemnified Parties and
Stockholder Indemnitees and (iii) as set forth in _Section 9.10_ with
respect to WSGR, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer on any person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successor and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement.

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

9.10 _Continuing Counsel_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,
Professional Corporation ("WSGR") has acted as counsel to Stockholders, the
Company (prior and including the Effective Time) and the Securityholders
Representative (collectively, the "Company Parties") in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Acquisition Engagement"),
and, in that connection, not as counsel for any other Person, including
Parent, MergerCos or any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company). Only the Company Parties shall be considered clients of
WSGR in the Acquisition Engagement. Parent agrees that it will not seek to
disqualify WSGR from acting and continuing to act as counsel to the
Securityholders Representative in the event of a dispute hereunder or in
the course of the defense or prosecution of any claim relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in any dispute against,
with or involving Parent, MergerCos, the Surviving Company or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates, solely by virtue of the fact that WSGR
represented the Company in the Acquisition Engagement.

 



105 (b) Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) agree that,
from and after the Closing, if, absent this sentence, any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection or other similar privilege or
protection would have applied to: (i) any communication in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby between WSGR, on the one hand, and the
Company, the Stockholders, the holders of Eligible Company Options and the
Securityholders Representative, on the other hand, during the representation
by WSGR of the Company with respect to the Acquisition Engagement, or (ii)
any advice in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby given to
the Stockholders, the holders of Eligible Company Options and the
Securityholders Representative, by WSGR during the representation by WSGR of
the Company with respect to the Acquisition Engagement, then neither Parent
nor its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) shall use any such
communication or advice against the Stockholders, the holders of
Eligible Company Options and the Securityholders Representative, in any
Action commenced at any time after the Closing between the Stockholders, the
holders of Eligible Company Options and the Securityholders Representative,
on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Company), on the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby; __provided__ , __however__ , that the restriction contained in this
_Section 9.10(b)_ shall not apply to any such communication or advice that
reflects or demonstrates any Knowledge of the Company, or to the knowledge of
any Stockholder or any holder of Eligible Company Options, or any of the
Companys or any such Stockholder or Optionholders Representatives, any
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct; and __provided__ ,
__further__ , that the Surviving Company shall continue to own and have the
right to assert any such attorney-client privilege, attorney work product
protection or other similar privilege or protection.

JOINDER AGREEMENT

THIS JOINDER AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made by and between
Guidewire Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Cyence Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and the undersigned holder ("
_Holder_ ") of shares of capital stock of the Company and/or options to
purchase capital stock of the Company. Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as the
same may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as
of October 5, 2017, by and among Parent, the Company, Caesar Acquisition Sub
I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_MergerCo I_ "), Caesar Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _MergerCo II_ " and, together
with MergerCo I, the " _MergerCos_ ") and Shareholder Representative Services
LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, as the Securityholders
Representative, MergerCo I shall merge with and into the Company (the " _First
Merger_ "), and, as part of the same overall transaction, the Company would
then merge with and into MergerCo II (the " _Second Merger_ " and together
with the Frist Merger, the " _Mergers_ ");

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the consummation of the First Merger, the shares of
Company Capital Stock held by the Stockholders will be converted into the
right to receive Parent Shares and/or cash, subject to and conditioned upon
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, it is a condition to the obligation of Parent and the MergerCos to
effect the First Merger that Indemnifying Parties entitled to receive, in the
aggregate, ninety-five percent (95%) or more of the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Indemnifying Parties shares of Company Capital
Stock and Eligible Company Options, as applicable, (assuming for such
purposes that the entire Escrow Amount and Deferred Merger Consideration is
released to the Indemnifying Parties, without interest) execute and deliver
this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and MergerCos to complete the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Holder is willing to enter into this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, in consideration of the
foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Representations and Warranties of Holder_. Holder hereby represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

(a) Holders address and email address set forth on the signature page
hereto are accurate and complete.

(b) If Holder is an entity, it has all requisite power and authority or, if
Holder is an individual, he/she has the legal capacity, to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its, his or her covenants and obligations under this
Agreement. If Holder is an entity, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the performance by Holder of its covenants and obligations
under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Holder and no further action is required on the part of Holder to
authorize this Agreement or the performance by Holder of its covenants
and obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Holder, and assuming the due authorization, execution

 



1  and delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Holder, enforceable against Holder in accordance with its terms,
subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, the relief of debtors and enforcement of creditors rights in
general and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief,
other equitable remedies and other general principles of equity.

(c) As of the date hereof, there is no Action of any nature pending, or to the
knowledge of Holder, threatened, against Holder or any of Holders properties
(whether tangible or intangible) or, if Holder is an entity, any of Holders
officers or directors (in their capacities as such), arising out of or
relating to (i) Holders beneficial ownership of Company Capital Stock,
Company Options, or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock or Company
Options, (ii) Holders capacity as a Company Stockholder, or holder of Company
Options or other Company Securities, (iii) this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, the Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement (as applicable) or any
of the other Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (iv) any contribution, assignment, sale or other transfer of
assets (tangible and intangible) by Holder to any Company Entity (or any of
their respective Affiliates), or (v) any other Contract between Holder and any
Company Entity (or any of their respective Affiliates). As of the date hereof,
there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Holder, threatened against
Holder with respect to which Holder has the right, pursuant to Contract,
Delaware Law or otherwise, to indemnification from any Company Entity related
to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The execution and delivery by Holder of this Agreement and the performance
by Holder of its, his or her covenants and obligations hereunder will not
conflict with (i) any provision of the charter documents of Holder if Holder
is an entity, (ii) any material contract to which Holder or any of its, his or
her properties or assets is subject, or (iii) any judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Holder or its, his
or her properties or assets. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, qualification, designation, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required on the part of Holder in order to enable
Holder to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform its, his or her
covenants and obligations under this Agreement.

 

(e) Holder has received a copy of the Merger Agreement and has carefully read
and understands the scope and effect of the provisions of this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement and has discussed the foregoing with Holders
professional advisors to the extent Holder has deemed necessary.

 

(f) Holder is the sole record and beneficial owner of, and has the sole right
to vote, if applicable, and to dispose of, the shares of Company Capital
Stock and Company Options set forth on the signature page hereto (subject to,
in the case of individuals, applicable community property laws, if any), and
such shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Options are, or as of the
Closing will be, free and clear of any pledge, lien, security interest,
mortgage, charge, claim, equity, option, proxy, voting restriction, voting
trust or agreement, understanding, arrangement, right of first refusal,
limitation on disposition, adverse claim of ownership or use or encumbrance
of any kind (other than the Terminated Contracts). Holder is not a party to
any Contract with respect to the voting of equity securities of the Company or
relating to the allocation of the Merger Consideration in a manner that is
inconsistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement or, if Holder is party
thereto, a Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement other than (i) the
Terminated Contracts and (ii) any agreements that Holder is specifically
required to enter into pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Other than the shares
of Company Capital Stock and Company Options set forth on the signature page
to this Agreement, Holder does not beneficially own any other shares of
Company Capital Stock or options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company
Capital Stock or any other Company Securities.

 



2 (g) Holder has not (i) sold, assigned, endorsed, transferred, pledged, pawned,
hypothecated, deposited under any Contract or disposed of in any manner any
of the shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options set forth on the
signature page hereto, or any interest therein, (ii) granted any options,
warrants, calls or any other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire any such
shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or any interest therein, or
(iii) entered into any Contract with respect to any of the matters
contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii).

 

(h) Holder acknowledges and understands that the representations, warranties
and covenants by Holder set forth herein and any covenants set forth in the
Merger Agreement applicable to the Stockholders and Indemnifying Parties will
be relied upon by Parent, MergerCos, the Company, the Surviving Company, and
their respective Affiliates , and that substantial losses and damages may
be incurred by such Persons if Holders representations, warranties or
covenants set forth herein and any covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement
applicable to Holder are inaccurate or are breached.

 

2\. _Representations and Warranties regarding Parent Shares_. If Holder is
acquiring Parent Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement and/or a Deferred
Merger Consideration Agreement, as applicable, Holder hereby represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

(a) Holder is acquiring the Parent Shares for investment for its, his or her
own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and Holder has no present
intention of distributing any of such securities in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities law and has no Contract with
any person regarding the distribution of such securities in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities law. 

(b) Holder understands and acknowledges that its, his or her investment in the
Parent Shares to be issued in connection with the First Merger, including, if
applicable, pursuant to a Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement, involves a
high degree of risk and has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as
it, he or she has considered necessary to make an informed
investment decision with respect to its, his or her acquisition of the Parent
Shares.

(c) Holder understands and acknowledges that the issuance of Parent Shares to
be issued in connection with the First Merger including, if applicable,
pursuant to a Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement will not be immediately
registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption from
the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act,
the availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide
nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Holders representations
set forth in this Agreement and the Investor Questionnaire submitted by
Holder in connection with the First Merger.

(d) Holder understands and acknowledges that the Parent Shares issued in
connection with the First Merger constitute "restricted securities" under Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act and, therefore, such shares may not
be sold unless they are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities
Act is available.

(e) Holder agrees that each book-entry security entitlement representing any
Parent Shares (or any other securities issued in respect of such shares upon
any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or
similar event) issued to Holder in connection with the First Merger,
including, if applicable, pursuant to a Deferred Merger Consideration
Agreement, shall bear legends set forth in Section 6.21(d) of the Merger
Agreement.

 



3 3\. _Agreement to be Bound to the Merger Agreement_.

 

(a) Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that he, she or it is either a (i)
"Stockholder" or holder of "Eligible Company Options" and (ii) an
"Indemnifying Party" for purposes of the Merger Agreement and, accordingly,
agrees to be bound by the provisions of (x) the Merger Agreement applicable to
Stockholders and/or holders of Eligible Company Options and Indemnifying
Parties, including Section 6.20 of the Merger Agreement (for any Stockholder
receiving Parent Shares in connection with the First Merger, including
pursuant to a Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement) and Article VII of the
Merger Agreement as it relates to Stockholders, holders of Eligible Company
Options or Indemnifying Parties, including severally, but not jointly (in
accordance with his, her or its Pro Rata Portions) indemnifying and holding
harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under Article VII of the Merger
Agreement as it relates to Stockholders, holders of Eligible Company Options
or Indemnifying Parties and as fully as though Holder were a signatory
thereto and (y) the transfer restrictions of the Registration Rights
Agreement.

(b) Holder acknowledges and agrees that (i) at the Closing, Parent shall
deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent pursuant to and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and, in the
case of any Holder who is a Deferred Merger Consideration Employee, the
applicable Deferred Merger Consideration Agreement; (ii) Holder shall be
entitled to a portion of the Escrow Amount only if, as and when such amount
becomes payable to Holder in accordance with the provisions of the Merger
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and, in the case of any Holder who is a
Deferred Merger Consideration Employee, the applicable Deferred Merger
Consideration Agreement; and (iii) Holders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Amount represents only a contingent right to receive a portion of the Escrow
Amount, if any, distributed to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the
indemnification and other provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and, in the case of any Holder who is a Deferred Merger
Consideration Employee, the applicable Deferred Merger Consideration
Agreement.

(c) Holder acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent shall hold the
Escrow Shares from Stockholders that are Accredited Investors as a book
position registered in the name of Wilmington Trust N.A., as Escrow Agent and
nominee for the benefit of Holder and the other Indemnifying Parties. Subject
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Holder shall have all rights with
respect to its Escrow Shares during the period of time in which such shares
have not been transferred or forfeited and are retained by Parent (including,
without limitation, the right to vote such shares and the right to receive on
a current basis any cash dividends or other distributions made with respect to
such Escrow Shares), except the right of possession or transfer thereof. 

4\. _Securityholders  Representative_. Holder hereby agrees to the
appointment of Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company (" _SRS_ "), as Securityholders Representative under the
Merger Agreement and appoints SRS as Holders agent and attorney-in-fact to
exercise all or any of the powers, authority and discretion conferred on the
Securityholders Agent under the Merger Agreement.

 

5. _Confidentiality_. Holder agrees to at all times for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Time to keep confidential and not divulge, furnish or make accessible any information regarding or relating to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, the Closing or any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Related Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to anyone (other than directors, officers, managers, partners, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and any other advisors, consultants or representatives of Holder that are (a) bound by confidentiality restrictions or (b) made aware of the confidential nature of such information, directed by Holder to treat such information as confidential and bound by legally enforceable codes of professional responsibility that require 

 



4  maintenance of confidentiality) except, in each case, to the extent that (i)
such information has otherwise been made public (other than as a result of
disclosure by Holder in violation of the terms of this Agreement, any Person
to whom Holder disclosed such information who violated the terms of any
confidentiality obligation to Holder); (ii) Holder is required by applicable
Law or any applicable Order to divulge or disclose such information, in which
case Holder shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent, at
Parents expense, to limit such disclosure to the extent permitted under
applicable Law; (iii) Holder is required by an applicable process, subpoena
or order, provided that Holder gives Parent notice that is reasonable in the
circumstances and cooperates with Parent to obtain a protective order, at
Parents expense, to take such other legal steps to protect its interest
in such information; or (iv) disclosure is necessary to enforce Holders
rights or defend against assertions by Parent under or arising from the Merger
Agreement, the Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

 

6\. _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Holder acknowledges and agrees that
to the extent Holder is a party to any Contract set forth on Exhibit A (each
a " _Terminated Contract_ " and collectively the " _Terminated Contracts_ ")
by and between the Company and the other parties thereto, Holder consents and
agrees to the termination of such Terminated Contract contingent upon the
consummation of the First Merger and effective as of the Effective Time and
agrees that any rights and obligations Holder may have under such Terminated
Contract shall terminate upon the Effective Time, and Holder agrees that it
will take no action with regard to pursuing any claim pursuant to such
Terminated Contract. Furthermore, the Holder and the Company each hereby
acknowledges and agrees that to the extent any Terminated Contract may, by
its terms, only be amended or terminated pursuant to an agreement or other
instrument, written or otherwise, between the Company and one or more other
parties thereto, this Agreement, together with the other Joinder Agreements
entered into by other holders of Company Securities in connection with the
Merger Agreement, who are also parties to such Terminated Contract, shall be
deemed to be one and the same instrument for purposes of satisfying the
termination or amendment requirements set forth in any such Terminated
Contract, and the Company hereby consents to each such termination.

7\. _General Release_.

 

(a) Effective for all purposes as of the Effective Time, Holder, on behalf of

(c) Holder hereby waives and agrees not to assert any appraisal or dissenters
rights under applicable provisions of Delaware Law, California Law or any
other Law.

(d) Holder acknowledges that he, she or it is familiar with Section 1542 of

provides as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 

(e) Holder, on behalf of himself, herself or itself and each other Releasor,
hereby waives and relinquishes any rights and benefits that any Releasor may
have under Section 1542 or any similar statute or common law principle of any

Releasor, acknowledges that he, she or it may hereafter discover facts
in addition to or different from those that Holder or any other Releasor now
knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter of this
release, but it is Holders intention, on behalf of himself, herself or itself
and each other Releasor, subject to Section 7(a), to fully and finally and
forever settle and release any and all Claims (unless specifically excluded
pursuant to Section 7(a)) that do now exist, may exist or heretofore have
existed with respect to the subject matter of this release. In furtherance of
this intention, the releases contained herein shall be and remain in effect as
full and complete general releases notwithstanding the discovery or existence
of any such additional or different facts. Holder hereby irrevocably
covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any Claim (unless
specifically excluded pursuant to Section 7(a)), or commencing, instituting or
causing to be commenced, any action, proceeding, charge, complaint, or
investigation of any kind against any of the Released Parties, in any forum
whatsoever (including any administrative agency), that arises out of, relates
in any way to, or is based upon, any of the Released Matters

 

(f) Holder represents and acknowledges that he, she or it has read this
release and understands its terms and has been given an opportunity to ask
questions of the Companys representatives. Holder further represents that in
signing this release he, she or it does not rely, and has not relied, on any
representation or statement not set forth in this release made by any
representative of the Company or anyone else with regard to the subject
matter, basis or effect of this release or otherwise.

(g) If Holder is married or is a party to a community property agreement or
arrangement with Holders spouse or domestic partner, he or she has delivered

partner, as applicable. Holders spouse or domestic partner, as applicable, is
competent to execute and deliver the Spousal Consent.

(b)  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections
or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." Unless the context of this Agreement
otherwise requires (i) words of any gender include each other gender, (iii)
words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number respectively, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder," and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement and (iv) references
to any statute shall refer to the statute, as amended, and include the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. The use of "or" is not intended to be
exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise. All references in this
Agreement to the subsidiaries of a legal entity shall be deemed to include
all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity.

(c) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument.
Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any
such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manners
and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

 

(d) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein and
therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, including all the exhibits
attached hereto and thereto, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms, and (b) are
not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder (other
than the Parent Indemnified Parties and Releasees who are not party to this
Agreement, which Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement against Holder in
accordance with its terms).

 

(e) _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

(f) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly

 



8  agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby waive the requirement
of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein.

 

(g) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such
states principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, in the case of a federal claim as to which federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction, the Federal Court of the United States of
America) in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of
Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such
process. Each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related
hereto except in such courts.

(h) _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement and each Exhibit
attached hereto, the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

(i) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

INVESTOR QUESTIONNAIRE

 

This confidential Investor Questionnaire (this "Questionnaire") is being sent
to you in connection with a potential transaction (the "Transaction")
involving Cyence Inc., (the "Company"), in which securities ("Securities") may
be issued to the stockholders of the Company (the "Company Stockholders").
Any Company Stockholder who is not able to complete this Questionnaire and
certify that he, she or it qualifies as an "accredited investor" as defined
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), may not be eligible
to receive Securities pursuant to the Transaction. If the Transaction is
consummated, the Securities will be issued without registration under the Act
and the securities laws of certain states, in reliance on the exemptions
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and/or on Regulation D promulgated
thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws.
This Questionnaire will be used to determine whether the Company Stockholders
will meet the applicable suitability requirements for these exemptions. The
information supplied by you will be used in determining whether you meet such
criteria, and reliance upon the private offering exemptions from registration
is based in part on the information herein supplied.

This Questionnaire does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of
an offer to buy any security. All Company Stockholders must answer all
applicable questions and complete, date and sign this Questionnaire. Please
print or type your responses and attach additional sheets of paper if
necessary to complete your answers to any item.

This Questionnaire and the information contained herein, including the fact
that the Company may engage in the potential Transaction, constitutes
confidential information of the Company. You should not disclose this
information, or share this Investor Questionnaire, with any other person other
than your legal, tax, accounting and financial advisors on a
confidential basis.

limited partner in any limited partnership, contributions to an IRA or KEOGH
retirement plan, alimony payments, and any amount by which income from long-
term capital gains has been reduced in arriving at adjusted gross income.

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

 

AND

INVENTIONS AGREEMENT 

The following confirms an agreement between me and Guidewire Software, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (hereafter referred to as the "Company"), which is a
material part of the consideration for my employment by the Company:



   1. | I understand that the Company possesses Proprietary Information
which is important to its business. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Proprietary Information" is information that was developed, created,
or discovered by the Company, or which became known by, or was conveyed to
the Company, which has commercial value in the Companys business.
"Proprietary Information" includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets,
copyrights, ideas, techniques, know-how, inventions (whether patentable or
not), and/or any other information of any type relating to designs,
configurations, toolings, documentation, recorded data, schematics, circuits,
mask works, layouts, source code, object code, master works, master
databases, algorithms, flow charts, formulae, works of authorship, mechanisms,
research, manufacture, improvements, assembly, installation, intellectual
property including patents and patent applications, business plans, past or
future financing, marketing, forecasts, pricing, customers, the salaries,
duties, qualifications, performance levels, and terms of compensation of other
employees, and/or cost or other financial data concerning any of the
foregoing or the Company and its operations generally and other information
concerning the Companys actual or anticipated business, research or
development, or which is received in confidence by or for the Company
from any other person. I understand that my employment creates a relationship
of confidence and trust between me and the Company with respect to Proprietary
Information. 
---|--- 
 



   2. | I understand that the Company possesses "Company Documents" which
are important to its business. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company
Documents" are documents or other media that contain Proprietary Information
or any other information concerning the business, operations or plans of the
Company, whether such documents have been prepared by me or by others.
"Company Documents" include, but are not limited to, blueprints, drawings,
photographs, charts, graphs, notebooks, customer lists, computer disks, tapes
or printouts, sound recordings and other printed, typewritten or handwritten
documents. 
---|--- 
 



   3. | In consideration of my employment by the Company and the
compensation received by me from the Company from time to time, I hereby agree
as follows: 
---|--- 
 

a. All Proprietary Information and all patents, patent rights, copyrights,
mask work rights, trade secrets, moral rights and other rights in connection
therewith shall be the sole property of the Company. I hereby assign to the
Company any rights I may have or acquire in such Proprietary Information. At
all times, both during my employment by the Company and after its termination,
I will keep in confidence and trust and will not use or disclose any
Proprietary Information or anything relating to it without the prior written
consent of an officer of the Company, except as may be necessary in the
ordinary course of performing my duties to the Company. b. I agree to make and maintain adequate and current written records, in a
form specified by the Company, of all inventions, trade secrets and works of
authorship assigned or to be assigned pursuant to this Agreement. All Company
Documents shall be the sole property of the Company. I agree that during my
employment by the Company, I will not remove or electronically transmit any
Company Documents from the business premises of the Company or deliver any
Company Documents to any person or entity outside the Company, except as I am
required to do in connection with performing the duties of my employment. I
further agree that, immediately upon the termination of my employment by me or
by the Company for any reason, or during my employment if so requested by the
Company, I will return all Company Documents, apparatus, equipment, and other
physical property, or any reproduction of such property, excepting only (i) my
personal copies of records relating to my compensation; (ii) my personal
copies of any materials previously distributed generally to shareholders of
the Company; and (iii) my copy of this Agreement.

c. I will promptly disclose in writing to my immediate supervisor, with a copy
to the President of the Company, or to any persons designated by the Company,
all "Inventions," which includes all improvements, inventions, works of
authorship, mask works, computer programs, formulae, ideas, processes,
techniques, know-how, and data, whether or not patentable, made or conceived
or reduced to practice or developed by me, either alone or jointly with
others, during the terms of my employment. I will also disclose to
the President of the Company all things that would be Inventions if made
during the term of my employment, conceived, reduced to practice, or developed
by me within six (6) months of the termination of my employment with the
Company or my departure. Such disclosures shall be received by the Company in
confidence (to the extent they are not assigned in (d) below) and do not
extend the assignment made in Section (d) below. I will not disclose
Inventions to any person outside the Company unless I am requested to do so
by management personnel of the Company.

d. I agree that all Inventions which I make, conceive, reduce to practice or
develop (in whole or in part, either alone or jointly with others) during my
employment shall be the sole property of the Company to the maximum extent
permitted by Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, a copy of which is
attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto. This assignment shall not extend to
Inventions, the assignment of which is prohibited by Labor Code Section 2870\.
The Company shall be the sole owner of all patents, copyrights and
other intellectual property or other rights in connection therewith. I
further acknowledge and agree that such Inventions, including any computer
programs, programming documentation, and other works of authorship, are "works
made for hire" for purposes of the Companys rights under copyright laws. I
hereby assign to the Company any rights I may have or acquire in such
Inventions.

 

e. I agree to perform, during and after my employment, all acts deemed
necessary or desirable by the Company to permit and assist it, at
the Companys expense, in obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing
patents, copyrights or other rights on such

 



5  Inventions and improvements in any and all countries. Such acts may include,
but are not limited to, execution of documents and assistance or cooperation
in legal proceedings. I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company
and its duly authorized officers and agents, as my agents and attorney-in-fact
to act for and on my behalf and instead of me, to execute and file any
applications or related findings and to do all other lawfully permitted acts
to further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyrights or other rights
thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.

f. I have attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto a complete list of all Inventions or
improvements to which I claim ownership and that I desire to remove from the
operation of this Agreement, and I acknowledge and agree that such list is
complete. If no such list is attached to this Agreement, I represent that I
have no such Inventions and improvements at the time of signing this
Agreement. If, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate
into a Company product, process or machine such an existing Invention or
improvement owned by me or in which I have an interest, the Company is hereby
granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual,
worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Invention or
improvement as part of or in connection with such product, process or machine.

 

g. During the term of my employment and for one (1) year thereafter, I will
not encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for
any reason. However, this obligation shall not affect any responsibility I may
have as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and
firing of Company personnel.

 

h. Prior to my submitting or disclosing for possible publication or
dissemination outside the Company any material prepared by me
that incorporates information that concerns the Companys business or
anticipated research, I agree to deliver a copy of such material to an officer
of the Company for his or her review. Within twenty (20) days of such
submission, the Company agrees to notify me whether the Company believes such
material contains any Proprietary Information, and I agree to make such
deletions and revisions as are reasonably requested by the Company to protect
its Proprietary Information. I further agree to obtain the consent of the
Company prior to any review of such material by persons outside the Company.

i. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and as
an employee of the Company does not and will not breach any agreement to keep
in confidence proprietary information, knowledge or data acquired by me in
confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company, and I will not
disclose to the Company, or induce the Company to use, any confidential or
proprietary information or material belonging to any previous employers or
others. I represent and warrant that I have returned all property and
confidential information belonging to all prior employers. I have not entered
into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral
in conflict herewith or in conflict with my employment with the Company.
I further agree to conform to the rules and regulations of the Company.

 



6 my ability to file a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission ("Government
Agencies"). I further understand that this Agreement does not limit my ability
to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency,
including providing documents or other information, without notice to the
Company. This Agreement does not limit my right to receive an award for
information provided to any Government Agencies. 
---|--- 



   4. | I agree that I am employed on an "at-will" basis. This means that
I have the right to resign and the Company has the right to terminate my
employment at any time for any reason, with or without cause. This is the
complete agreement between the Company and me on this term of my employment. I
further agree that this term can only be modified by an officer of the Company
and he or she can only do so in a writing signed and dated by him or her and
me. 
---|--- 



   5. | If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be
unenforceable under applicable law, such provisions shall be excluded from
this Agreement and the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
such provisions were so excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with
its terms. 
---|--- 



   6. | This Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of my
employment with the Company and shall be binding upon me, my heirs, executor,
assigns, and administrators, and shall inure to the benefit of the Company,
its subsidiaries, successors and assigns. 
---|--- 



   7. | I agree that the covenants and obligations contained in this
Agreement relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a
violation of any of such covenants or obligations may cause the Company
irreparable injury for which adequate remedy at law will not be available;
and, therefore, that upon any such breach of any such covenant or obligation,
or any threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to the immediate remedy
of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or such other form
of injunctive or equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies they might
have at law. Furthermore, I agree to indemnify the Company against and shall
reimburse the Company for and in respect of any and all claims, demands,
losses, cost, expenses, obligations, liabilities, damages, remedies and
penalties, including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses that the Company shall incur or suffer and which arise from, are
attributable to, by reason of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy
of or any failure to perform or comply with any of my agreements or covenants
contained in this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   8. | This Agreement can only be modified by a subsequent written
agreement executed by an officer of the Company. 
---|--- 



   9. | Although I may work for the Company outside of California or the
United States, I understand and agree that this Agreement shall be interpreted
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

 

AND

INVENTIONS AGREEMENT 

The following confirms an agreement between me and Guidewire Software, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (hereafter referred to as the "Company"), which is a
material part of the consideration for my employment by the Company:



   11. | I understand that the Company possesses Proprietary Information
which is important to its business. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Proprietary Information" is information that was developed, created,
or discovered by the Company, or which became known by, or was conveyed to
the Company, which has commercial value in the Companys business.
"Proprietary Information" includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets,
copyrights, ideas, techniques, know-how, inventions (whether patentable or
not), and/or any other information of any type relating to designs,
configurations, toolings, documentation, recorded data, schematics, circuits,
mask works, layouts, source code, object code, master works, master
databases, algorithms, flow charts, formulae, works of authorship, mechanisms,
research, manufacture, improvements, assembly, installation, intellectual
property including patents and patent applications, business plans, past or
future financing, marketing, forecasts, pricing, customers, the salaries,
duties, qualifications, performance levels, and terms of compensation of other
employees, and/or cost or other financial data concerning any of the
foregoing or the Company and its operations generally and other information
concerning the Companys actual or anticipated business, research or
development, or which is received in confidence by or for the Company
from any other person. I understand that my employment creates a relationship
of confidence and trust between me and the Company with respect to Proprietary
Information. 
---|--- 
 



   12. | I understand that the Company possesses "Company Documents" which
are important to its business. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company
Documents" are documents or other media that contain Proprietary Information
or any other information concerning the business, operations or plans of the
Company, whether such documents have been prepared by me or by others.
"Company Documents" include, but are not limited to, blueprints, drawings,
photographs, charts, graphs, notebooks, customer lists, computer disks, tapes
or printouts, sound recordings and other printed, typewritten or handwritten
documents. 
---|--- 
 



   13. | In consideration of my employment by the Company and the
compensation received by me from the Company from time to time, I hereby agree
as follows: 
---|--- 
 

a. All Proprietary Information and all patents, patent rights, copyrights,
mask work rights, trade secrets, moral rights and other rights in connection
therewith shall be the sole property of the Company. I hereby assign to the
Company any rights I may have or acquire in such Proprietary Information. At
all times, both during my employment by the Company and after its termination,
I will keep in confidence and trust and will not use or disclose any
Proprietary Information or anything relating to it without the prior written
consent of an officer of the Company, except as may be necessary in the
ordinary course of performing my duties to the Company.

 b. I agree to make and maintain adequate and current written records, in a
form specified by the Company, of all inventions, trade secrets and works of
authorship assigned or to be assigned pursuant to this Agreement. All Company
Documents shall be the sole property of the Company. I agree that during my
employment by the Company, I will not remove or electronically transmit any
Company Documents from the business premises of the Company or deliver any
Company Documents to any person or entity outside the Company, except as I am
required to do in connection with performing the duties of my employment. I
further agree that, immediately upon the termination of my employment by me or
by the Company for any reason, or during my employment if so requested by the
Company, I will return all Company Documents, apparatus, equipment, and other
physical property, or any reproduction of such property, excepting only (i) my
personal copies of records relating to my compensation; (ii) my personal
copies of any materials previously distributed generally to shareholders of
the Company; and (iii) my copy of this Agreement.

c. I will promptly disclose in writing to my immediate supervisor, with a copy
to the President of the Company, or to any persons designated by the Company,
all "Inventions," which includes all improvements, inventions, works of
authorship, mask works, computer programs, formulae, ideas, processes,
techniques, know-how, and data, whether or not patentable, made or conceived
or reduced to practice or developed by me, either alone or jointly with
others, during the terms of my employment. I will also disclose to
the President of the Company all things that would be Inventions if made
during the term of my employment, conceived, reduced to practice, or developed
by me within six (6) months of the termination of my employment with the
Company or my departure. Such disclosures shall be received by the Company in
confidence (to the extent they are not assigned in (d) below) and do not
extend the assignment made in Section (d) below. I will not disclose
Inventions to any person outside the Company unless I am requested to do so
by management personnel of the Company.

d. I agree that all Inventions which I make, conceive, reduce to practice or
develop (in whole or in part, either alone or jointly with others) during my
employment shall be the sole property of the Company. The Company shall be the
sole owner of all patents, copyrights and other intellectual property or
other rights in connection therewith. I further acknowledge and agree that
such Inventions, including any computer programs, programming documentation,
and other works of authorship, are "works made for hire" for purposes of
the Companys rights under copyright laws. I hereby assign to the Company any
rights I may have or acquire in such Inventions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, any provision in this Agreement requiring me
to assign rights to an invention does not apply to any invention exempted
from such assignment by applicable state law. I further acknowledge that my
agreement to assign inventions to the Company does not apply to an invention
for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secretion information of
the Company was used and which was developed entirely on my own time, unless
(a) the invention relates (i) to the business of the Company, or (ii) to the
Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b)
the invention results from any work performed by me for the Company.

 



13 e. I agree to perform, during and after my employment, all acts deemed
necessary or desirable by the Company to permit and assist it, at the
Companys expense, in obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents,
copyrights or other rights on such Inventions and improvements in any and all
countries. Such acts may include, but are not limited to, execution of
documents and assistance or cooperation in legal proceedings. I hereby
irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers
and agents, as my agents and attorney-in-fact to act for and on my behalf and
instead of me, to execute and file any applications or related findings and to
do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance
of patents, copyrights or other rights thereon with the same legal force and
effect as if executed by me.

f. I have attached as  _Exhibit A_ hereto a complete list of all Inventions
or improvements to which I claim ownership and that I desire to remove from
the operation of this Agreement, and I acknowledge and agree that such list is
complete. If no such list is attached to this Agreement, I represent that I
have no such Inventions and improvements at the time of signing this
Agreement. If, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate
into a Company product, process or machine such an existing Invention or
improvement owned by me or in which I have an interest, the Company is hereby
granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual,
worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Invention or
improvement as part of or in connection with such product, process or machine.

g. During the term of my employment and for one (1) year thereafter, I will
not encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for
any reason. However, this obligation shall not affect any responsibility I may
have as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and
firing of Company personnel.

h. Prior to my submitting or disclosing for possible publication or
dissemination outside the Company any material prepared by me that
incorporates information that concerns the Companys business or anticipated
research, I agree to deliver a copy of such material to an officer of the
Company for his or her review. Within twenty (20) days of such submission,
the Company agrees to notify me whether the Company believes such material
contains any Proprietary Information, and I agree to make such deletions and
revisions as are reasonably requested by the Company to protect its
Proprietary Information. I further agree to obtain the consent of the Company
prior to any review of such material by persons outside the Company.

 

i. I agree that during my employment with the Company, and for a period of 12
months after termination of my employment for any reason by either me or the
Company (other than being included in a reduction in force), I will not,
without the prior written consent of the Company (1) engage in any business,
or activity that is competitive with the current business or
proposed business of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates (the
"Company Business"), (2) become employed by, associated with or otherwise
assist any person, corporation or entity engaging in activity competitive with
the Company 

 



14  Business, and (3) contact, call upon, sell to, or provide (or attempt to
contact, call upon, sell to or provide) to any current or potential customers
of the Company any services or products that compete with the Company
Business. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply both during normal
working hours and at all other times including, but not limited to, nights,
weekends, and vacation time, both during and after my employment by the
Company. The Company Business currently includes researching, developing,
marketing, distributing, licensing, and selling (i) property and casualty
insurance software applications; (ii) software, digital, data and analytics
services; and (iii) professional consulting services offerings, all of which
can be used by property and casualty insurers worldwide, and I understand that
the Company Business will expand over time.

 

j. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and as
an employee of the Company does not and will not breach any agreement to keep
in confidence proprietary information, knowledge or data acquired by me in
confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company, and I will not
disclose to the Company, or induce the Company to use, any confidential
or proprietary information or material belonging to any previous employers or
others. I represent and warrant that I have returned all property and
confidential information belonging to all prior employers. I have not entered
into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral
in conflict herewith or in conflict with my employment with the Company. I
further agree to conform to the rules and regulations of the Company.

 



   3.1. | I understand that nothing contained in this Agreement limits my
ability to file a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission ("Government
Agencies"). I further understand that this Agreement does not limit my ability
to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency,
including providing documents or other information, without notice to the
Company. This Agreement does not limit my right to receive an award for
information provided to any Government Agencies. 
---|--- 



   14. | I agree that I am employed on an "at-will" basis. This means that
I have the right to resign and the Company has the right to terminate my
employment at any time for any reason, with or without cause. This is the
complete agreement between the Company and me on this term of my employment. I
further agree that this term can only be modified by an officer of the Company
and he or she can only do so in a writing signed and dated by him or her and
me. 
---|--- 



   15. | If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be
unenforceable under applicable law, such provisions shall be excluded from
this Agreement and the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
such provisions were so excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with

Agreement relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a
violation of any of such covenants or obligations may cause the Company

This Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the "Agreement") is
being executed and delivered as of , 2017 by [NAME]
("Stakeholder") in favor and for the benefit of Cyence Inc., a Delaware
Corporation (the "Company") and Guidewire Software, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement
(as defined below).

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, the
Company, Caesar Acquisition Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo I"), Caesar Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("MergerCo II"), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado
limited liability company, as the Securityholders Representative (the
"Securityholders Representative"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of October 5, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which (i) MergerCo I will merge with and into the Company, after which
MergerCo I will cease to exist and the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and (ii) the Company will merge with and into MergerCo
II, after which MergerCo II will continue as the surviving company (the
"Merger");

 

WHEREAS, it is a condition to the obligations of Parent and the MergerCo I and
MergerCo II to effect the Merger that each of the employees of the Company
set forth on Schedule I to the Merger Agreement (the "Key Employees"), execute
and deliver this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent, MergerCo I and MergerCo II to complete the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the undersigned Key
Employee is willing to enter into this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, Parent
and Stakeholder hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_Effective Date_. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Closing. This
Agreement shall be null and void if the Merger is not consummated as
substantially contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _Noncompetition_. During the period commencing with the Closing Date and
ending on the five year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition
Period"), Stakeholder shall not (other than in connection with any employment
services to the Company, Parent, or any subsidiary thereof or their respective
successors or assigns), without the prior written consent of Parent, directly
or indirectly:

2.1 engage in Competition (as defined below) in any country, province, state,
city, or other similar political subdivision of the world in which the Company
or any of its Affiliates has carried on or intended to carry on business prior
to the closing of the Merger (the "Restricted Territory");



 

 or

 

2.2 be or become an officer, director, stockholder, owner, affiliate,
salesperson, co-owner, partner, trustee, promoter, technician, engineer,
analyst, employee, agent, representative, supplier, contractor, consultant,
advisor or manager of, or to otherwise acquire or hold any interest in, or
participate in or facilitate the financing, operation, management or control
of any firm, partnership, corporation, person, entity or business that engages
or participates in Competition in the Restricted Territory;

 

 _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or
restrict Stakeholder from any of the following: (i) owning as a passive
investment less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock (or
equity interests) of a corporation (whether public or private) that is engaged
in Competition and Stakeholder is not otherwise associated with such
corporation; (ii) owning a passive equity interest in a private or public
debt or equity investment fund (including without limitation hedge and mutual
funds) in which the Stakeholder does not have the ability to control or
exercise any managerial influence over such fund; (iii) serving as a board
member, advisor, investor, or consultant to any company or entity that is not
engaged in Competition, so long as such activity does not create a conflict of
interest with the Company; or (iv) any activity consented to in writing by
Parent.

"Competition" means engaging in any business (including research
and development), operations, activities and/or services (or assisting any
third party in the same) that develops, markets, sells or distributes software
or services to insurance companies that uses data science (including large
scale data collection and modeling and software engineering and/or economics)
to prospect and select risks, assess and price risks, manage risk portfolios
and accumulations, bring new insurance products to market, determine
distribution channel strategy and performance, or identify potential other
adverse events or actors impacting product profitability including potential
fraud, whether related to cyber risk or otherwise. For clarity, during the
Non-Competition Period, Stakeholder may be employed by, or serve as a
consultant to, an insurance broker, a reinsurance broker, an insurance
company, a reinsurance company, an insurance linked security company, or an
insurance or reinsurance fund/facility, provided Stakeholder (i) does not
engage in activities in Competition with Company or any of its Affiliates,
and/or (ii) is not involved in internal entity effort that might reasonably be
expected to cause such entity to forego any products or services of Company
or any of its Affiliates.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Nonsolicitation_. Stakeholder further agrees that Stakeholder shall not
during the Non-Competition Period, directly or indirectly, without the prior
written consent of Parent:

3.1 personally or through others, induce, attempt to induce, solicit or
attempt to solicit any employee of the Company or of Parent, or their
respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns to engage in any activity in
which Stakeholder would be prohibited from engaging; or

3.2 personally or through others, in connection with pursuing activities in
Competition: (i) induce or attempt to induce any client, customer or business
prospect of the Company or Parent to terminate its relationship(s) with the
Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns; or
(ii) otherwise take any action relating to said client or customer that would
interfere with the business of the Company or Parent or their respective
subsidiaries, successors or assigns.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, the placement
of general advertisements that may be targeted to a particular geographic or
technical area but that are not specifically targeted toward employees of
Parent or the Company or their respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns,
shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 3. 

 



20 ARTICLE IV

 

 _Severability of Covenants_. The covenants contained in Sections 2 and 3
hereof shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
country, province, state, city or other political subdivision of the world.
Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed
identical in terms to the covenant contained in Sections 2 and 3 hereof. If,
in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of such separate
covenants (or any part thereof), then Parent, the Company and Stakeholder
agree that such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be eliminated
from this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate
covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the
provisions of Section 2 or Section 3 are deemed to exceed the time,
geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable law, then Parent, the
Company and Stakeholder agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the
maximum time, geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted
by applicable law.

ARTICLE V

 

 _Independence of Obligations_. The covenants and obligations of Stakeholder
set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other
agreement or arrangement between Stakeholder, on the one hand, and Parent, the
Company or any subsidiary of Parent or the Company, on the other.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

 _Stakeholder Acknowledgement_. Stakeholder acknowledges that (i) Stakeholder
has a substantial interest in the Company and is a substantial stockholder;
(ii) the goodwill associated with the existing business, customers and assets
of the Company prior to the Merger is an integral component of the value of
the Company to Parent and is reflected in the consideration payable to
Stakeholder in connection with the Merger, and (iii) Stakeholders agreement
as set forth herein is necessary to preserve the value of the Company for
Parent following the Merger. Stakeholder also acknowledges that
the limitations of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in this
Agreement are reasonable because, among other things: (A) the Company and
Parent are engaged in a highly competitive industry, (B) Stakeholder has had
unique access to the trade secrets and know-how of the Company, including,
without limitation, the plans and strategy (and, in particular, the
competitive strategy) of the Company, and (C) Stakeholder believes that
this Agreement provides no more protection than is reasonably necessary to
protect Parents legitimate interest in the goodwill of the Company and its
trade secrets.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

 _Injunctive Relief_. The remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement is
and will be inadequate, and in the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Stakeholder of this Agreement, Parent, shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining Stakeholder from breaching or otherwise violating any provision of
this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as
prohibiting Parent from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such
breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, the recovery of
damages from Stakeholder.

 



21 ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Non-Exclusivity_. The rights and remedies of Parent hereunder are not
exclusive of or limited by any other rights or remedies that Parent hereunder
may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of which
shall be cumulative (and not alternative). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the rights and remedies of Parent hereunder, and the
obligations and liabilities of Stakeholder hereunder, are in addition to their
respective rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities under the law of
unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets and the like. This
Agreement does not limit Stakeholders obligations or the rights of Parent (or
any affiliate of Parent) under the terms of any other agreement between
Stakeholder and Parent or any affiliate of Parent.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Survival_. Section 2 and Section 3 of this Agreement shall terminate upon
expiration of the Non-Competition Period; provided, however, that if, at any
time, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Stakeholder breached
Section 2 and/or Section 3 during the Non-Competition Period, the respective
Section(s) shall not terminate upon expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
but instead, shall remain in full force and effect until six (6) months
following the date that Stakeholder is no longer in breach of such provisions.
The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the expiration of the Non-
Competition Period.

ARTICLE X

 

 _Notices_. All notices and other communications pursuant to this Agreement
shall be in writing and deemed to be sufficient if contained in a written
instrument and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by electronic
mail, telecopied, sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier or mailed by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, to
the respective parties at the following address:

expenses in connection with such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding.

ARTICLE XIV

 

 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege
or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power,
right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the waiving party; and any such waiver
shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (the "Agreement") is
being executed and delivered as of , 2017 by [NAME]
("Stakeholder") in favor and for the benefit of Cyence Inc., a
Delaware Corporation (the "Company") and Guidewire Software, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement
(as defined below).

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, the
Company, Caesar Acquisition Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo I"), Caesar Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("MergerCo II"), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado
limited liability company, as the Securityholders Representative (the
"Securityholders Representative"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of October 5, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which (i) MergerCo I will merge with and into the Company, after which
MergerCo I will cease to exist and the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and (ii) the Company will merge with and into MergerCo
II, after which MergerCo II will continue as the surviving company (the
"Merger");

 

WHEREAS, it is a condition to the obligations of Parent and the MergerCo I and
MergerCo II to effect the Merger that each of the employees of the Company
set forth on Schedule I to the Merger Agreement (the "Key Employees"), execute
and deliver this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent, MergerCo I and MergerCo II to complete the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the undersigned Key
Employee is willing to enter into this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, Parent
and Stakeholder hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_Effective Date_. This Agreement shall be effective as of the Closing. This
Agreement shall be null and void if the Merger is not consummated as
substantially contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _Noncompetition_. During the period commencing with the Closing Date and
ending on the two year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition
Period"), Stakeholder shall not (other than in connection with any employment
services to the Company, Parent, or any subsidiary thereof or their respective
successors or assigns), without the prior written consent of Parent, directly
or indirectly:

2.1 engage in Competition (as defined below) in any country, province, state,
city, or other similar political subdivision of the world in which the Company
or any of its Affiliates has carried on or intended to carry on business prior
to the closing of the Merger (the "Restricted Territory"); or

 

2.2 be or become an officer, director, stockholder, owner, affiliate,
salesperson, co-owner, partner, trustee, promoter, technician, engineer,
analyst, employee, agent, representative, supplier, contractor, consultant,
advisor or manager of, or to otherwise acquire or hold any interest in, or
participate in or facilitate the financing, operation, management or control
of any firm, partnership, corporation, person, entity or business that engages
or participates in Competition in the Restricted Territory;

 

 _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or
restrict Stakeholder from any of the following: (i) owning as a passive
investment less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock (or
equity interests) of a corporation (whether public or private) that is engaged
in Competition and Stakeholder is not otherwise associated with such
corporation; (ii) owning a passive equity interest in a private or public
debt or equity investment fund (including without limitation hedge and mutual
funds) in which the Stakeholder does not have the ability to control or
exercise any managerial influence over such fund; (iii) serving as a board
member, advisor, investor, or consultant to any company or entity that is not
engaged in Competition, so long as such activity does not create a conflict of
interest with the Company; or (iv) any activity consented to in writing by
Parent.

"Competition" means engaging in any business (including research
and development), operations, activities and/or services (or assisting any
third party in the same) that develops, markets, sells or distributes software
or services to insurance companies that uses data science (including large
scale data collection and modeling and software engineering and/or economics)
to prospect and select risks, assess and price risks, manage risk portfolios
and accumulations, bring new insurance products to market, determine
distribution channel strategy and performance, or identify potential other
adverse events or actors impacting product profitability including potential
fraud, whether related to cyber risk or otherwise. For clarity, during the
Non-Competition Period, Stakeholder may be employed by, or serve as a
consultant to, an insurance broker, a reinsurance broker, an insurance
company, a reinsurance company, an insurance linked security company, or an
insurance or reinsurance fund/facility, provided Stakeholder (i) does not
engage in activities in Competition with Company or any of its Affiliates,
and/or (ii) is not involved in internal entity effort that might reasonably be
expected to cause such entity to forego any products or services of Company
or any of its Affiliates.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Nonsolicitation_. Stakeholder further agrees that Stakeholder shall not
during the Non-Competition Period, directly or indirectly, without the prior
written consent of Parent:

3.1 personally or through others, induce, attempt to induce, solicit or
attempt to solicit any employee of the Company or of Parent, or their
respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns to engage in any activity in
which Stakeholder would be prohibited from engaging; or

3.2 personally or through others, in connection with pursuing activities in
Competition: (i) induce or attempt to induce any client, customer or business
prospect of the Company or Parent to terminate its relationship(s) with the
Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns; or
(ii) otherwise take any action relating to said client or customer that would
interfere with the business of the Company or Parent or their respective
subsidiaries, successors or assigns.

 



27 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, the placement
of general advertisements that may be targeted to a particular geographic or
technical area but that are not specifically targeted toward employees of
Parent or the Company or their respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns,
shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 3\.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Severability of Covenants_. The covenants contained in Sections 2 and 3
hereof shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each
country, province, state, city or other political subdivision of the world.
Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed
identical in terms to the covenant contained in Sections 2 and 3 hereof. If,
in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of such separate
covenants (or any part thereof), then Parent, the Company and Stakeholder
agree that such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be eliminated
from this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate
covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the
provisions of Section 2 or Section 3 are deemed to exceed the time,
geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable law, then Parent, the
Company and Stakeholder agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the
maximum time, geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted
by applicable law.

ARTICLE V

 

 _Independence of Obligations_. The covenants and obligations of Stakeholder
set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other
agreement or arrangement between Stakeholder, on the one hand, and Parent, the
Company or any subsidiary of Parent or the Company, on the other.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

 _Stakeholder Acknowledgement_. Stakeholder acknowledges that (i) Stakeholder
has a substantial interest in the Company and is a substantial stockholder;
(ii) the goodwill associated with the existing business, customers and assets
of the Company prior to the Merger is an integral component of the value of
the Company to Parent and is reflected in the consideration payable to
Stakeholder in connection with the Merger, and (iii) Stakeholders agreement
as set forth herein is necessary to preserve the value of the Company for
Parent following the Merger. Stakeholder also acknowledges that
the limitations of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in this
Agreement are reasonable because, among other things: (A) the Company and
Parent are engaged in a highly competitive industry, (B) Stakeholder has had
unique access to the trade secrets and know-how of the Company, including,
without limitation, the plans and strategy (and, in particular, the
competitive strategy) of the Company, and (C) Stakeholder believes that
this Agreement provides no more protection than is reasonably necessary to
protect Parents legitimate interest in the goodwill of the Company and its
trade secrets.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

 _Injunctive Relief_. The remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement is
and will be inadequate, and in the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Stakeholder of this Agreement, Parent, shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining Stakeholder from breaching or otherwise violating any provision of
this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as
prohibiting Parent from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such
breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, the recovery of
damages from Stakeholder.

 



28 ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Non-Exclusivity_. The rights and remedies of Parent hereunder are not
exclusive of or limited by any other rights or remedies that Parent hereunder
may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of which
shall be cumulative (and not alternative). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the rights and remedies of Parent hereunder, and the
obligations and liabilities of Stakeholder hereunder, are in addition to their
respective rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities under the law of
unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets and the like. This
Agreement does not limit Stakeholders obligations or the rights of Parent (or
any affiliate of Parent) under the terms of any other agreement between
Stakeholder and Parent or any affiliate of Parent.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Survival_. Section 2 and Section 3 of this Agreement shall terminate upon
expiration of the Non-Competition Period; provided, however, that if, at any
time, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Stakeholder breached
Section 2 and/or Section 3 during the Non-Competition Period, the respective
Section(s) shall not terminate upon expiration of the Non-Competition Period,
but instead, shall remain in full force and effect until six (6) months
following the date that Stakeholder is no longer in breach of such provisions.
The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the expiration of the Non-
Competition Period.

 _Notices_. All notices and other communications pursuant to this Agreement
shall be in writing and deemed to be sufficient if contained in a written
instrument and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by electronic

WHEREAS, Equityholder holds shares of capital stock of Cyence Inc., a Delaware

of the Merger Agreement (the "Company").

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, the Company is
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as the same may be

Parent ("MergerCo I"), Caesar Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and directly wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo

First Merger, subject to the possibility of forfeiture in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (and, for the other Specified Equityholders, the

valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree
as set forth herein.

AGREEMENT

1\. Deferred Merger Consideration; Restrictions on Transfer.

(a) On the Closing Date, a portion of the Merger Consideration payable to
Equityholder at the Closing will be issued to Equityholder in the form of
Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)(iv)_ of the Merger Agreement
(such Parent Shares, the "Deferred Merger Consideration Shares") and such
Deferred Merger Consideration Shares shall be subject to the possibility of
forfeiture described in _Sections 2(c)_ , _3_ , _4_ and _7(b)(ii)_ hereof;
__provided_ , _however__ , that such Deferred Merger Consideration
Shares shall be held in a restricted account of the transfer agent of Parent
for the benefit of Equityholder unless and until, and to the extent, such
shares vest and are transferred to an account designed by Equityholder in
accordance with the terms hereof. Such Deferred Merger Consideration Shares
will cease to be subject to such risk of forfeiture solely in accordance with
the vesting and other terms of this Agreement (including _Exhibit A_ ) and the
Merger Agreement. Equityholders (i) Deferred Merger Consideration Shares and
(ii) Consideration Percentage shall be determined in accordance with the terms
of the Merger Agreement and set forth on the Spreadsheet. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, the portion of the Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares eligible to vest, if any, will be calculated based on the
attainment, as determined in accordance with _Exhibit A_ , of the
performance milestones described on _Exhibit A_ during the Periods, which
amount of Parent Shares may be equal to all or a portion, including none, of
Equityholders Deferred Merger Consideration Shares. Under no circumstance is
Equityholder entitled to receive (and neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation or liability to issue or deliver to
Equityholder) any Parent Shares under this Agreement or the Merger Agreement
in excess of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares.

2\. Vesting; Forfeiture

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2(d)_ and _Section 3_, Equityholders Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares will vest, if at all, in accordance with the
following schedule:



     |  |  | the Period One Eligible Shares, if any, will vest on the
date on which year-end bonuses are paid by Parent to similarly situated
employees as Equityholder with respect to Period One (the "Period One Vesting
Date"), subject to Equityholders continued employment with Parent through
such date (except as otherwise provided in _Section 2(d)_ or _Section 3)_;
and 
---|---|---|--- the date on which year-end bonuses are paid by Parent to similarly situated
employees as Equityholder with respect to Period Two (the "Period Two Vesting
Date"), subject to Equityholders continued employment with Parent through
such date (except as otherwise provided in _Section 2(d)_ or _Section 3)_. 
---|---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the performance milestones set forth on
_Exhibit A_ for the applicable vesting date still apply pursuant to
this Agreement and the final determination of such performance milestones has
not been made by the applicable vesting dates set forth above, then the
applicable portion of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares shall not vest
until such final determination has been made.

(b) Promptly (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days) after the
later of (i) the date of vesting of the applicable portion of the Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares in accordance with _Sections 2(a)_ , _2(d)_ or _3_
, as applicable, and (ii) the date Equityholder provides the written
designation contemplated by this sentence, Parent shall instruct its transfer
agent to facilitate the movement of such portion of the Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares (except to the extent any portion thereof was previously
forfeited pursuant to _Sections 3_ , _4_ or  _7(b)(ii)_ ) into a brokerage
account designated by Equityholder in writing to Parent or the transfer agent.

(c) The portion, if any, of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares that has
not vested by the Period Two Vesting Date and was not previously forfeited
pursuant to _Section 3_, _4_ or _7(b)(ii)_ prior to the Period Two Vesting
Date shall automatically be forfeited by Equityholder effective as of the
Period Two Vesting Date, without any further action on behalf of Equityholder
or Parent.

 

(d) If a Parent Change in Control occurs during either Period One or Period
Two, the following vesting provisions will apply:

 

(i) If the Parent Change in Control occurs during Period One, the Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares will vest solely on a time-based schedule on the
applicable vesting dates set forth in _Section 2(a)_, subject to
Equityholders continued employment with Parent through the applicable vesting
date (except as otherwise provided in Section 3), irrespective of the
achievement of the performance milestones set forth on _Exhibit A_.

(ii) If a Parent Change in Control occurs during Period Two and prior to the
Period One Vesting Date, then, with respect to the Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares that could become eligible to vest with respect to Period
One in accordance with _Exhibit A_ , only the Period One Eligible Shares
shall be eligible to vest on the Period One Vesting Date, subject to
Equityholders continued employment with Parent through the Period One Vesting
Date (except as otherwise provided in  _Section 3_).

(iii) If a Parent Change in Control occurs during Period Two (whether prior to
or after the Period One Vesting Date), then, upon the occurrence of the
Parent Change of Control, fifty percent (50%) of the Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares (which shall be in addition to any Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares that vest in accordance with  _Section 2(d)(ii)_) will
become eligible to vest with respect to Period Two, with such amount of
Deferred Merger Consideration Shares to vest on the Period Two Vesting Date
subject to Equityholders continued employment with Parent through such date
(except as otherwise provided in _Section 3_), irrespective of the
achievement of the performance milestones in Period Two as set forth on
_Exhibit A_ , and there will be no additional shares that become eligible to
vest with respect to Period Two if the performance milestones for Period Two
are achieved in whole or in part. (iv) In the event of a Parent Change in Control, all references to
"Parent Shares" or "Deferred Merger Consideration Shares" hereunder shall
refer to the consideration into which the Parent Shares have been converted or
exchanged as a result of such Parent Change in Control.

 

(e) From the Closing Date until the time they are vested pursuant to _Sections
2(a)_ , _2(d)_ , _3(a)_ or _3(b)_ , or forfeited pursuant to _Sections 2(c)_
, _3_ , _4_ or _7(b)(ii)_ of this Agreement, the Deferred Merger Consideration
Shares shall be treated by Parent and its Affiliates as issued and outstanding
capital stock of Parent, and Equityholder will be shown as the record holder,
will be entitled to exercise voting rights, and will be entitled to receive
dividends (other than non-taxable stock dividends, which shall be held in
a restricted account of the transfer agent of Parent for the benefit of
Equityholder and included as part of the Deferred Merger Consideration
Shares).

 

(f) Upon the forfeiture of any Deferred Merger Consideration Shares pursuant
to _Sections 2(c)_ , _3_ , _4_ or _7(b)(ii)_ , Parent shall be entitled to
instruct its transfer agent to transfer such portion of the Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares to Parent or a designee of Parent or to otherwise cancel
such shares. In order to facilitate any such transfer or cancellation of
forfeited shares, Equityholder shall, prior to the Closing, deliver three (3)
original executed copies of a Stock Power in the form attached as _Exhibit B_
hereto with respect to the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares, each in
blank, to the Secretary of Parent, or the Secretarys designee, to hold such
Stock Power in escrow and to take all such actions and to effectuate all such
transfers as are in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If at any
time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest Parent with full right, title and possession of, or
to enable Parent to cancel, any forfeited Deferred Merger Consideration
Shares, then Equityholder hereby agrees to execute and deliver any documents
or other instruments and to take such action as is reasonably necessary to
effect such forfeiture, transfer or cancellation, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Any failure of Equityholder to deliver such
Stock Powers or other documents or instruments shall not in any way affect the
forfeiture of any Deferred Merger Consideration Shares, or Parents right to
receive or cancel any such forfeited shares, in accordance with the terms
hereof.

(g) If Equityholder is married or is a party to a community property
agreement or arrangement with Equityholders spouse or domestic partner, he or
she has delivered with this Agreement a Spousal Consent in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "Spousal Consent"), executed by Equityholders
spouse or domestic partner, as applicable. Equityholder represents and
warrants to Parent that Equityholders spouse or domestic partner, as
applicable, is competent to execute and deliver the Spousal Consent.

3\. Termination of Service

 

(a) Death/Disability

 

(i) If Equityholders employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
terminates during Period One due to (i) Equityholders death or (ii)
termination by Parent or such Affiliate as a result of Equityholders
disability in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employment
Agreement (either of (i) or (ii), as applicable, a "Death/Disability Event"
and the date of such Death/Disability Event, the "Death/Disability Date"), one
hundred percent (100%) of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares will vest
automatically as of the Death/Disability Date, and the vesting specified in
_Section 2(a)_ and/or _Exhibit A_ will not apply with respect to such shares. (ii) If Equityholders employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
terminates after the end of Period One and prior to the Period One Vesting

the date the Period One Eligible Shares are determined in accordance with
Exhibit A), and the vesting specified in _Section 2(a)_ will not apply with
respect to such shares.

 

(iii) If Equityholders employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
terminates during Period Two (whether prior to or after the Period One
Vesting Date) due to a Death/Disability Event, fifty percent (50%) of the
Deferred Merger Consideration Shares (which shall be in addition to any
Deferred Merger Consideration Shares that vest in accordance with  _Section
3(a)(ii)_) will vest automatically as of the Death/Disability Date, and the
vesting specified in _Section 2(a)_ and/or _Exhibit A_ will not apply with
respect to such shares, and there will be no additional shares that become
eligible to vest with respect to Period Two if the performance milestones with
respect to Period Two are achieved in whole or in part.

 

(iv) If Equityholders employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
terminates after the end of Period Two and prior to the Period Two Vesting

with Exhibit A), and the vesting specified in _Section 2(a)_ will not apply
with respect to such shares.

(b) Without Cause/Good Reason

(i) If Equityholders employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
terminates during Period One due to (i) termination by Parent or such

Termination" and the date of such Vesting Termination, the "Termination
Date"), one hundred percent (100%) of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares
will vest automatically as of the Termination Date, and the vesting specified
in _Section 2(a)_ and/or _Exhibit_ A will not apply with respect to such

to such shares.

 

(iii) If Equityholders employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent

his or her termination of employment and was not otherwise forfeited pursuant
to Section _4_ or _7(b)(ii)_ prior to such termination date shall
automatically be forfeited by Equityholder effective as of such termination
date, without any further action by or on behalf of Equityholder or Parent.

employment by Parent or any of its Affiliates to enable Equityholder to be
employed by a different Affiliate of Parent, or, in the case of termination by
an Affiliate, to enable Equityholder to be employed by Parent, will not be
deemed a termination of employment hereunder.

4\. Indemnification Obligations

 

Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that Equityholders right to receive
delivery of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares is subject to Parents
set-off rights in connection with Equityholders indemnification obligations
set forth in the Merger Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall have the right, at its election, to set-off all or any portion of any
Losses for which it is entitled to be indemnified by Equityholder pursuant to
the terms of the Merger Agreement from any portion of Equityholders
Deferred Merger Consideration Shares that becomes or could become vested
hereunder, and any such amount of Deferred Merger Consideration Shares as to
which Parent exercises such set-off right shall automatically be forfeited by
Equityholder effective as of the date such set-off occurs, without any further
action by or on behalf of Equityholder or Parent.

 

5\. Nontransferability

 

(a) No portion of Equityholders Deferred Merger Consideration Shares may be
Transferred, whether by operation of law or otherwise, nor may any portion of
Equityholders Aggregate Deferred Merger Consideration Shares be made subject
to execution, attachment, or similar process, unless and until, and only to
the extent, such Deferred Merger Consideration Shares have actually vested
and thereafter been transferred to an account designated by Equityholder in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) To ensure compliance with the restrictions imposed by this Agreement,
Parent may issue appropriate "stop-transfer" instructions to its transfer
agent. Parent shall not be required (a) to transfer on its books any Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares that have been Transferred in violation of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or (b) to treat as owner of such Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares, or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends,
to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares has been purportedly so Transferred.

(c) Each book-entry security entitlement representing any Deferred Merger
Consideration Shares (or any other securities issued in respect of such shares
upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation
or similar event) shall bear the following legend (in addition to any other
legends required by law, the Merger Agreement, Parents certificate of
incorporation, Parents bylaws or any other agreement to which such
Equityholder is a party):

 



     | THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON
TRANSFER AND RISK OF FORFEITURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISSUER OF THE SHARES,
AS SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE ORIGINAL HOLDER OF
THESE SHARES, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE
ISSUER. (d) Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that the release of the Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares from the restrictions on transfer pursuant to
Section 5(a) will not affect (i) the restrictions on transfer applicable to
the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares under applicable Law, the terms of
the Merger Agreement, the terms of the Joinder Agreement between Equityholder
and Parent entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement, and, if
Equityholder is an employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the terms of
Parents securities trading policies or (ii) Parents set-off rights with
respect to the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares in accordance with Article
VII of the Merger Agreement and _Section 4_ hereof.

 

6\. Leave of Absence

For purposes of this Agreement, Equityholders employment with Parent does
not terminate when he or she is on an approved leave of absence for military
service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by Parent, if
Equityholders right to re-employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by
contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was
granted or if Parent otherwise so provides in writing. Vesting under
this Agreement will continue for up to six (6) months in an approved medical
leave of absence and for up to three (3) months in an approved non-
medical/personal leave of absence, and if Equityholder returns to work,
vesting will restart on the first day of return to work. Equityholders
employment terminates in any event when the approved leave ends unless
Equityholder immediately returns to active employee work. Parent shall have
the right to determine, in its sole discretion, which leaves count for this
purpose and when Equityholders employment terminates for all purposes under
this Agreement.

 

7\. Taxes

(a) _Tax Reporting_. Equityholder shall make an election under Section 83(b)
of the Code with respect to the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares (other
than Deferred Merger Consideration Shares issued upon exercise of Company
Options pursuant to  _Section 9_) in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_
within thirty (30) days of the issuance of such Deferred Merger Consideration
Shares and promptly provide a copy of such election to Parent. If such
election has been timely filed pursuant to the preceding sentence with
respect to Deferred Merger Consideration Shares, the parties to this Agreement
intend to treat such Deferred Merger Consideration Shares as payment of
consideration in exchange for Equityholders Company Capital Stock and not as
compensation income for income Tax purposes. Parent, the Company and their
Affiliates will prepare all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing tax
treatment, and in the event of any dispute with a taxing authority regarding
the foregoing tax treatment, Parent, the Company and their Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Equityholder, on the other hand, shall defend such tax treatment
in good faith until there is a contrary assessment or determination made by
such taxing authority in such dispute.

(b) Subject to _Section 7(a)_, Equityholder agrees, as a condition of this
Agreement, that he or she will make acceptable arrangements to pay any
required withholding or other taxes that may be due relating to any portion of
Equityholders Deferred Merger Consideration Shares and the payment of any
such amounts under this Agreement to Equityholder. In the event that Parent
or any of its Affiliates determines that any federal, state, local, or foreign
tax or withholding payment is required relating to any portion of
Equityholders Deferred Merger Consideration Shares or the payment of any
such amounts under this Agreement to Equityholder, Parent or any such
Affiliate will have the right to (i) require Equityholder to tender a cash
payment or (ii) reduce the number of Deferred Merger Consideration Shares to
be released to Equityholder upon vesting, in each case, in an amount equal to
the amount of such withholding payment (which shares shall thereupon be
automatically forfeited by Equityholder hereunder, without any further action
by Equityholder or Parent). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties shall
determine whether withholding or other taxes are due pursuant to this _Section
7(b) _in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 7(a)_. 8\. Disclaimer of Rights; Parent Obligations

 

(a) This Agreement does not give Equityholder the right to be retained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Parent and its Affiliates
reserve the right to terminate Equityholders employment at any time and for
any reason.

(b) Parent shall have sole discretion with regard to all matters relating to
the operation of the businesses of Parent and its Affiliates, including the
Company, to achieve the growth targets set for its businesses. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates, including the Company, shall have any obligation to operate any of
their businesses in order to achieve any Company Bookings target hereunder or
to maximize the amount of the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares that vest
or become eligible to vest hereunder, and there is no assurance that any
Company Bookings targets will be achieved or that any portion of the Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares will vest or become eligible to vest hereunder;
provided, however, that Parent will not take any action in bad faith with the
specific intent of preventing or hindering the achievement of Company Bookings
in order to avoid having the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares vest or
become eligible to vest hereunder.

9\. Exercise of Company Options

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Equityholder will exercise a sufficient number of
Company Options held by Equityholder (including the early exercise of all
such Company Options to the extent unvested), either on a full or net exercise
basis as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to ensure that Equityholder
receives a number of Parent Shares equal to Equityholders portion of
the Deferred Merger Consideration payable in accordance with _Section
2.6(a)(iv)_ of the Merger Agreement.

10\. Entire Agreement

(a) This Agreement (including the _exhibits hereto_ , which form an integral
part hereof) and the Merger Agreement constitute the entire understanding
between Equityholder and Parent regarding the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, no failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such

suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or

or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns (if
any); _provided_ , _however_ , that Equityholder may not assign or transfer
this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder (by operation of law or
otherwise) to any Person without Parents prior written consent and any
assignment or transfer in violation of this proviso shall be null and void.

(g) Equityholder acknowledges that (i) this Agreement is intended to be a
material inducement for Parent and MergerCo to enter into the Merger Agreement

---|---|--- 



     | 4. | Calculation of Company Bookings. As soon as reasonably
practicable, and in any event no later than sixty (60) calendar days following
the end of each Period, Parent shall determine the portion of the Deferred
Merger Consideration Shares that is eligible to vest for that Period, if any,
based on the amount of the Company Bookings during the Period. Promptly
following such determination, Parent shall provide written notice to the
Specified Equityholders of such determination (the "Parent Notice"). In the
event that the Majority Equityholders agree in writing to dispute Parents
calculation of the Company Bookings with respect to any Period (such
written agreement, the "Dispute Notice"), and the Majority Equityholders
provide a copy of the Dispute Notice to Parent within thirty (30) calendar
days after Parent delivers the Parent Notice for such Period, then Parent
and Equityholder agree to refer such dispute to an independent, nationally
recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Majority
Equityholders (the "Independent Auditor") and such firm shall make the
final determination with respect to the amount of Company Bookings for such
Period in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. If the
Majority Equityholders fails to deliver the Dispute Notice to Parent within
such thirty (30) calendar day period, the determinations made by Parent with
respect to such Period as set forth in the Parent Notice will be used for
purposes of determining the Deferred Merger Consideration Shares that is
eligible to vest for such Period and shall be final and binding on
Equityholder. If the Majority Equityholders timely deliver a Dispute Notice,
the process and procedures governing the resolution of any such dispute by the
Independent Auditor shall be determined by the Independent Auditor. Parent
and the Majority Equityholders shall make readily available to the Independent
Auditor all relevant books and records relating to the Companys performance
with respect to the Company Bookings and all other related items reasonably
requested by the Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor, acting as an
expert, and not an arbiter, shall make a determination only as to each of the
items in dispute, with the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Independent Auditor in making such determination being limited to whether the
items in dispute were determined in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Independent Auditor shall make its determination based solely
on the presentations and information provided by Parent or the Majority
Equityholders and not by independent review. The Independent Auditors
determination as to the resolution of the differences and the resulting amount
of Company Bookings shall be in writing and Parent and the Majority
Equityholders shall direct the Independent Auditor to furnish such
determination to Parent and the Majority Equityholders as promptly as
practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the Independent
Auditor (and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days thereafter). Parent
and the Majority Equityholders shall further direct the Independent Auditor
not to, and the Independent Auditor shall not, assign a value to any item in
dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on
the one hand, or the Majority Equityholders, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the
Majority Equityholders, on the other hand. The determination of the
Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on Parent and the Specified
Equityholders and may be used in a court of law by either Parent or the
Majority Equityholders for the purpose of enforcing such decision. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be shared equally between Parent
and the Majority Equityholders.

PARACHUTE PAYMENT WAIVER

 

WHEREAS, Guidewire Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); Caesar
Acquisition Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MergerCo I"); Caesar
Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo II"); Cyence Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"); and Shareholder Representative Services LLC,
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger
Agreement") whereby the Company will be acquired by Parent (the "Transaction")
and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

WHEREAS, the undersigned ("Disqualified Individual") has received, or is or
may be entitled to receive, certain payments and benefits as described in the
Golden Parachute Disclosure Statement (the "Disclosure Statement"), attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_.

 

WHEREAS, the payments and benefits described in the Disclosure Statement
(collectively, the "Payments") could constitute "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and the Treasury Regulations and related guidance thereunder (collectively,
the "Golden Parachute Provisions").

WHEREAS, the Golden Parachute Provisions provide that a payment or benefit
will not constitute a parachute payment if the individuals right to receive
or retain that payment or benefit is contingent upon the approval of such
payment or benefit by the corporations stockholders obtained in accordance
with the requirements of the Golden Parachute Provisions.

WHEREAS, Disqualified Individual is willing to waive any and all of
Disqualified Individuals right or entitlement to receive or retain portions
of the Payments to the extent that the aggregate value of the Payments exceeds
the amount that is $1.00 less than 3 times Disqualified Individuals average
annual taxable compensation from the Company during the preceding 5-year
period (or period of service with the Company, if shorter) (the "Base Amount")
as calculated in accordance with the Golden Parachute Provisions (the value
of such Payments that exceeds the amount that is $1.00 less than 3 times the
Base Amount, the "Excess Payments"), unless such Excess Payments are approved
by the Companys stockholders in accordance with the Golden Parachute
Provisions so that the Payments will not result in (i) the loss of tax
deductions by the Company or Parent under the Golden Parachute Provisions or
(ii) an imposition of an excise tax on Disqualified Individual under Section
4999 of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Disqualified Individual hereby
agrees as follows:

 

1\. Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in the Merger Agreement
or any document governing any of the Payments, Disqualified Individual hereby
waives any and all of Disqualified Individuals right or entitlement to
receive or retain any payments or benefits described in the Disclosure
Statement to the extent they would constitute Excess Payments unless the
Excess Payments are approved by the stockholders of the Company in accordance
with the Golden Parachute Provisions. Accordingly, in the absence of such
stockholder approval, Disqualified Individual shall not be paid the portions
of the Payments that constitute Excess Payments. 2\. This Parachute Payment Waiver shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California without reference to such
states principles of conflicts of law. Disqualified Individual hereby (i)
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court located within

to pay any taxes on any interest or other income from investment earned on the
Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to
distribute to Parent (to the account set forth in _Schedule IV_ hereto) (i)
within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter and (ii) upon any final

and directed to sell or redeem any such investments as it deems necessary to
make any payments or distributions required under this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss which may
result from any investment or sale of investment made pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement (unless such loss was caused by fraud, or by the gross negligence,
or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent in handling the investment). The
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment
permitted by this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such
affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or
dealing as principal for its own account. The parties hereto acknowledge that

p.m. (California time) on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following the date

shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent no later than
two (2) Business Days following each occurrence of an event under Section
7.4(b) or Section 7.4(c) of the Merger Agreement that entitles Parent to

joint written instruction will specify the amount of the Losses payable to
Parent or the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of the
applicable claim for indemnification, and, within three (3) Business Days
after delivery thereof, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Shares and
Escrow Cash from the Escrow Account, as applicable, in the amount of such

anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Final Release Date_ "), upon joint
written instruction from Parent and the Securityholders Representative, the
Escrow Agent shall release to the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent for
the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties (and in all cases subject to the
provisions of Article VII of the Merger Agreement and _Section 4(d)_ hereof)
any Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares then remaining in the Escrow Account, less
the sum of actual Losses or Losses estimated by Parent in good faith (i) in
respect of any resolved claims for indemnification that have yet to be paid
to the Parent Indemnified Parties or (ii) which may reasonably be required to
satisfy any unresolved and pending claims specified in any Claim Certificate
based on the facts and circumstances existing at the expiration of such
18-month period. The amounts to be so released will be specified in the joint
written instruction.

 

(c) _Release of Unresolved Claims_. In the event that there exist Unresolved
Claims as of the Escrow Release Date, as soon as any such Unresolved Claim
has been resolved and, if applicable, satisfied, upon joint written
instruction from Parent and the Securityholders Representative, the Escrow
Agent shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days
following receipt of such joint written instruction, deliver in accordance
with _Section 4(d)_ hereunder, the portion of the Escrow Account to the
Persons and in the amounts set forth in the instructions.

 

(d) _Distributions_.

(i)  _Disbursements to Parent_. Each claim for Losses that is to be satisfied
from the Escrow Account pursuant to _Article VII_ of the Merger Agreement
and, if applicable, the Closing Adjustment Amount Overpayment, shall be
satisfied by delivery to Parent pursuant to joint written instruction signed
by Parent and Securityholders Representative provided to the Escrow Agent
which will include the amount of shares and cash to be disbursed, on behalf of
the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties in the case of Losses or for the
benefit of Parent in the case of the Closing Adjustment Amount, of Escrow
Shares and Escrow Cash in an amount equal to such Losses or the Closing
Adjustment Amount Overpayment, as applicable. The amount of Escrow Shares and
Escrow Cash to be delivered to Parent to satisfy each such claim and, if
applicable, the Closing Adjustment Amount Overpayment, shall be determined by
reference to each Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the amount to be
so delivered and, as to each Indemnifying Party, out of such Indemnifying
Partys Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares in the same proportion as the Escrow
Cash and Escrow Shares deposited with respect to such Indemnifying Party into
the Escrow Account (i.e., 100% Escrow Cash with respect to former holders of
Company Common Stock and vested Company Options, and 40% Escrow Cash and 60%
Escrow Stock with respect to former holders of Company Preferred Stock).

 



4 (ii) _Disbursements to Indemnifying Parties_. With respect to disbursements of
Escrow Cash from the Escrow Account to the Indemnifying Parties, the Escrow
Agent shall, pursuant to joint written direction that includes the amount of
cash and Parent Shares to be disbursed, deliver to the Paying Agent the
amounts owed to the Company Stockholders and the Non-Employee Optionholders
and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation the amounts owed with respect
to the Eligible Options held by all other Company Optionholders, for the
benefit of the Indemnifying Parties, and the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall distribute to each Indemnifying Party its
portion of such distributed Escrow Cash. Disbursements of Escrow Shares to
Indemnifying Parties shall be made in accordance with _Section 4(d)(iii)_.
The amounts of Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares to be so delivered to each
Indemnifying Party shall be made in the form of Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares
in the same proportion as the Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares deposited with
respect to such Indemnifying Party to the Escrow Account pursuant to _Article
II_ of the Merger Agreement (i.e., 100% Escrow Cash with respect to former
holders of Company Common Stock and vested Company Options, and 40% Escrow
Cash and 60% Escrow Stock with respect to former holders of Company Preferred
Stock). The amount of any Escrow Cash to be so delivered to any Indemnifying
Party shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent, and the number of
Escrow Shares so delivered to any Indemnifying Party shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number of Parent Shares. Any Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash
remaining after such rounding shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to joint written instruction from the Parties, in an equitable
manner, as determined in good faith by the Surviving Company, taking into
account the Indemnifying Parties respective Pro Rata Portion, and in
connection therewith the Surviving Company may direct the Paying Agent to
liquidate all or any portion of such remaining Escrow Shares after such
rounding prior to any such distribution.

 

(iii) _Disbursement of Escrow Shares_. The Escrow Agent is not the stock
transfer agent for the Escrow Shares. The distribution or release of any
Escrow Shares to either Parent or any Indemnifying Party, as the case may be,
pursuant to this _Section 4 _shall be effected by Parents transfer agent
Computershare Shareowners Services LLC (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") (following
delivery thereto by the Escrow Agent of written direction which Parents
Transfer Agent may reasonably require of the Escrow Agent to effect such
transfer). The Escrow Agent may contact the Transfer Agent in accordance with
the contact information set forth in _Section 12(e)_ hereof. For purposes of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have delivered Escrow
Shares to the person entitled to it when the Escrow Agent has delivered such
written direction to the Transfer Agent with instructions to deliver a
certificate representing the appropriate number of shares to the appropriate
person with a certificate representing the residual shares comprising the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account to be returned
to the Escrow Agent (or to make such change in the book-entries with respect
to such Parent Shares). Following Escrow Agents delivery of such instructions
to the Transfer Agent, any Person entitled to Escrow Shares shall consult
directly with the Transfer Agent regarding any delay or problem with delivery
of Escrow Shares to such person. Distributions of Escrow Shares shall be made
to the holders of Escrow Shares at the addresses set forth in _Schedule I_ as
may be updated by the Securityholders Representative.

 



5 (iv) Delivery of the Escrow Amount or any portion thereof out of the Escrow
Account to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Section 4_ shall be
made by the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation and Transfer Agent, as
applicable, pursuant to joint written directions and based on each
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the amount to be so delivered as
contemplated above. For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, shares of Parent
Shares held in the Escrow Account shall be valued at the Parent Share Price.

 

Section 5\. _Termination_. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the
distribution of the entire Escrow Account from the account established
hereunder. The provisions of _Sections_ _6_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ and _12_ shall
survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement and the earlier resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent.

 

Section 6\. _Compensation of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to payment from Parent for customary fees and expenses for all services
rendered by it hereunder as set forth on _Schedule III_ hereto. The fee agreed
upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as compensation for the
Escrow Agents services as contemplated by this Escrow Agreement; provided,
however, that in the event that the conditions for the disbursement of funds
under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any
service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment
of interest in the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, or any material
modification hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the
Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Escrow
Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be
compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all reasonable
and out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable, documented out of
pocket attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay,
controversy, litigation or event, except in the case where such litigation
results in a final adjudication finding that the losses directly result from
the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any amount due
to the Escrow Agent hereunder is not paid within thirty (30) calendar days of
the date due, the Escrow Agent in its sole discretion may charge interest on
such amount up to the highest rate permitted by applicable law. The Escrow
Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Account
with respect to its unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied
indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or
entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid
fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the
Escrow Account.

Section 7.  _Resignation of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be
discharged from its duties hereunder at any time by giving thirty (30)
calendar days prior written notice of such resignation to Parent and the
Securityholders Representative. Parent and the Securityholders
Representative may remove the Escrow Agent at any time by giving thirty (30)
calendar days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent. Upon such notice, a
successor escrow agent shall be appointed by Parent and the Securityholders
Representative, who shall provide written notice of such to the resigning or
removed Escrow Agent. Such successor escrow agent shall become the escrow
agent hereunder upon the resignation or removal date specified in such
notice. If Parent and the Securityholders Representative are unable to agree
upon a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after such notice, the
Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, deliver the Escrow Amount to Parent
at the address provided herein or may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief. The costs and expenses (including its reasonably
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with
such proceeding shall be shared equally by Parent and the Securityholders
Representative (solely on behalf of the Indemnifying

 



6  Parties). Upon receipt of the identity of the successor escrow agent, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Account then held hereunder to the
successor Escrow Agent. Upon its resignation or removal and delivery of the
Escrow Account as set forth in this Section 7, the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection
with the Escrow Account or this Agreement.

 

Section 8\. _Indemnification of Escrow Agent_. Parent and the Securityholders
Representative (solely on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and in its
capacity as the Securityholders Representative, not in its individual
capacity) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, from and against
and reimburse the Escrow Agent for any and all losses, damages, injuries (to
person or property), penalties, stamp or other similar taxes, actions, suits,
judgments, reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket
attorneys fees and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to
defend against any claim of liability) of whatever kind or nature,
demanded, asserted or claimed against the Escrow Agent arising from claims
against the Escrow Agent by reason of its participation in the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation all reasonable costs
required to be associated with claims for damages to persons or property, and
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and court costs
except to the extent caused by the Escrow Agents fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The provisions of this  _Section 8_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement or the earlier resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent. The costs and expenses of the obligations contained in this
_Section 8_ shall be shared equally by Parent and the Securityholders
Representative (solely on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and in its
capacity as the Securityholders Representative, not in its individual
capacity).

 

Section 9\. _Limitation of Liability_. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT
OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW
AGENTS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

Section 10\. _The Escrow Agent_.

 

(a) The duties, responsibilities and obligations of Escrow Agent shall be
limited to those expressly set forth herein which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and no duties, responsibilities or obligations shall be
inferred or implied against the Escrow Agent. Under no circumstances will the
Escrow Agent be deemed to be a fiduciary to any Party or any other person
under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible or
liable for the failure of any other Party to perform in accordance with this
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor
chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument, or document other than this Escrow Agreement, whether
or not an original or a copy of such agreement has been provided to the Escrow
Agent; and the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to know or inquire as to the
performance or nonperformance of any provision of any such agreement,
instrument, or document. References

 



7  in this Escrow Agreement to any other agreement, instrument, or document are
for the convenience of the Parties, and the Escrow Agent has no duties or
obligations with respect thereto. This Escrow Agreement sets forth all
matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred or implied from the terms of
this Escrow Agreement or any other agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be
required to expend or risk any of its own funds or otherwise incur any
liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder, except for any ordinary course expenses incurred by the Escrow
Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder.

(b) If at any time the Escrow Agent is served with any judicial or
administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or
administrative process which in any way affects the Escrow Account (including
but not limited to orders of attachment or garnishment or other forms of
levies or injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of the Escrow
Account), the Escrow Agent is authorized to comply therewith in any manner it
or legal counsel of its own choosing deems reasonably appropriate; and if the
Escrow Agent complies with any such judicial or administrative order,
judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process,
in the absence of fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part,
the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any
other person or entity even though such order, judgment, decree, writ or
process may be subsequently modified or vacated or otherwise determined to
have been without legal force or effect.

 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted or
for any loss or injury resulting from its actions or its performance or lack
of performance of its duties hereunder in the absence of fraud, gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part. In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable (i) for acting in accordance with or
conclusively relying upon any instruction, notice, demand, certificate or
document from Parent and the Securityholders Representative or any entity
acting on behalf of Parent and the Securityholders Representative, (ii) for
any indirect, consequential, punitive or special damages, regardless of the
form of action and whether or not any such damages were foreseeable or
contemplated, (iii) for the acts or omissions of its nominees, correspondents,
designees, agents, subagents or subcustodians, or (iv) for an amount in
excess of the value of the Escrow Account, valued as of the date of deposit,
but only to the extent of direct money damages. Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to consult with legal counsel in the event that a question or dispute arises
with regard to the construction of any of the provisions hereof, and shall
incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with
the advice or opinion of such counsel.

 

(d) _Escheat_. The Parties are aware that under applicable state law, property
which is presumed abandoned may under certain circumstances escheat to the
applicable state. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to the Parties,
their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, or any
other party, should any or all of the Escrow Account escheat by operation of
law. 

(e) Attorneys and Agents. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the advice of counsel or other professionals retained
or consulted by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed as set
forth in Section 3.1 for any and all compensation (fees, expenses and other
costs) paid and/or reimbursed to such counsel and/or professionals. The Escrow
Agent may perform any and all of its duties through its agents,
representatives, attorneys, custodians, and/or nominees.

choosing as to any matter relating to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent
shall not incur any liability in acting in good faith in accordance with any
advice from such counsel.

Escrow Agreement shall not be construed as duties.

 

(h) The Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability, in the absence of fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, for not performing or
delay in performance of any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or
responsibility hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond the control of the
Escrow Agent (including but not limited to any act or provision of any present
or future law or regulation or governmental authority, any act of God or war,
civil unrest, local or national disturbance or disaster, any act of terrorism,
or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or facsimile or other
wire or communication facility).

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order,
judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing
delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity
or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity or
the service thereof. The Escrow Agent may act in conclusive reliance upon any
written instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume
that any person purporting to give receipt or advice to make any statement or
execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so.

(j) The Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to give the Escrow Amount
held by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar
property.

(k) The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible in any respect for the
form, execution, validity, value or genuineness of documents or securities
deposited hereunder, or for any description therein, or for the identity,
authority or rights of persons executing or delivering or purporting to
execute or deliver any such document, security or endorsement. The Escrow
Agent shall not be called upon to advise any party as to the wisdom in selling
or retaining or taking or refraining from any action with respect to any
securities or other property deposited hereunder. 

(l) At any time, the Escrow Agent may request an instruction in writing in
English from Parent and the Securityholders Representative and may, at its
own option, include in such request the course of action it proposes to take
and the date on which it proposes to act, regarding any matter arising in
connection with its duties and obligations hereunder.

 

(m) When the Escrow Agent acts on any information, instructions or
communications (including, but not limited to, communications with respect to
the delivery of securities or the wire transfer of funds) sent by telex,
facsimile, email or other form of electronic or data transmission, the Escrow
Agent, absent fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, shall
not be responsible or liable in the event such communication is not an
authorized or authentic communication of Parent and/or the Securityholders
Representative or is

 



9  not in the form Parent and/or the Securityholders Representative sent or
intended to send (whether due to fraud, distortion or otherwise). Parent and
the Securityholders Representative (solely on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties and in its capacity as the Securityholders Representative, not in its
individual capacity) shall indemnify the Escrow Agent against any loss,
liability, claim or expense (including legal fees and expenses) it may incur
with its acting in accordance with any such communication.

(n) In the event of any apparent ambiguity in any notice, instruction or
other communication received by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow Agent
may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action other than to
retain possession of the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Cash in the Escrow
Account, unless the Escrow Agent receives written instructions, signed by
Parent and the Securityholders Representative, which addresses such apparent
ambiguity.

 

(o) In the event of any dispute between or conflicting claims among Parent and
the Securityholders Representative and any other person or entity authorized
to act with respect to any Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled,
in its sole discretion, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands
or instructions with respect to such Escrow Account so long as such
dispute or conflict shall continue, and the Escrow Agent shall not be or
become liable in any way to Parent and the Securityholders Representative for
failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or
instructions. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to refuse to act until, in
its sole discretion, either (i) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands
shall have been determined by a final order, judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction, which order, judgment or decree is not subject to
appeal, or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced
in a writing satisfactory to the Escrow Agent or (ii) the Escrow Agent shall
have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to it sufficient to hold
it harmless from and against any and all losses which it may incur by reason
of so acting. Any court order, judgment or decree shall be accompanied by a
legal opinion by counsel for the presenting party, reasonably satisfactory to
the Escrow Agent, to the effect that said order, judgment or decree represents
a final adjudication of the rights of the parties by a court of competent
jurisdiction, and that the time for appeal from such order, judgment or
decree has expired without an appeal having been filed with such court. The
Escrow Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinions without further
question. The Escrow Agent may, in addition, elect, in its sole discretion, to
commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as it
may deem, in its sole discretion, necessary. The costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
proceeding shall be paid by, and shall be shared equally by Parent and the
Securityholders Representative (solely on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties).

(p) The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the contents of any
writing of the arbitrators or any third party contemplated herein as a means
to resolve disputes and may conclusively rely without any liability upon the
contents thereof.

 

(q) The Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Account
deposited hereunder but is serving as escrow holder only and having
only possession thereof. Parent and the Securityholders Representative
(solely on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and in its capacity as the
Securityholders Representative, not in its individual capacity) shall pay
or 

 



10  reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for any transfer taxes or other
taxes relating to the Escrow Account incurred in connection herewith (other
than taxes imposed on the Escrow Agent as the result of its fees and other
income derived by it pursuant to this Agreement) and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Escrow Agent from any amounts that it is obligated to pay in the
way of such taxes. Any payments of income from this Escrow Account shall be
subject to withholding regulations then in force with respect to United States
taxes. Parent, at the instruction of Computershare Trust Company N.A in its
capacity as exchange agent for the First Merger, will provide the
Escrow Agent with appropriate IRS Forms W-9 for tax identification number
certifications, or, if applicable, IRS Forms W-8 for non-U.S. person
certifications, for each Indemnifying Party. This paragraph shall survive
notwithstanding any termination of this Escrow Agreement or the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent.

 

(r) Any corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent may be
converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated, or to which it may
sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business and
assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation or
association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or
transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party, shall be and become the
successor escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement and shall have and succeed
to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and privileges as its predecessor,
without the execution or filing of any instrument or paper or the performance
of any further act.

(s) The Escrow Agent shall provide to Parent and the
Securityholders Representative monthly statements identifying transactions,
transfers or holdings of the Escrow Account.

Section 11\. _Tax Reporting_.

(a) Pursuant to _Section 3(d)_ above, while it is being held in the Escrow
Account, the Escrow Cash shall be treated for tax purposes (including for all
U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax reporting purposes) as being owned
by Parent. The Escrow Agent and Parent agree that the following specific
transactions will be reported as provided in this  _Section 11_. The Escrow
Agent shall be deemed the payor of any interest or other income paid upon
investment of the Escrow Account for purposes of performing applicable tax
reporting. The Escrow Agent will prepare and file, if required in connection
with any interest payments made by the Escrow Agent to Parent under this
Agreement, IRS Form 1099-INT. With respect to any other payments made under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be deemed the payor and shall have
no responsibility for performing tax reporting, and the Escrow Agents
function of making any such payments is solely ministerial and upon express
direction of the Parties.

 

(b) Prior to closing, the Parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with
certified tax identification numbers by furnishing appropriate forms W-9 or
W-8 and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may request.
The Parties understand that if such tax reporting documentation is
not provided and certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be
required by the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold
a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the
Escrow Amount.

 



11 (c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of interest or other income derived from the investment of
the Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent
possible from the Escrow Account. Parent and the Securityholders
Representative (solely on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and in its
capacity as the Securityholders Representative, not in its individual
capacity), jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow
Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or
other cost or expense that may be assessed against the Escrow Agent on or with
respect to the Escrow Amount and the investment thereof unless such tax, late
payment, interest, penalty or other expense was directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.

Section 12\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (i) constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (ii)

laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise

jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (unless the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the
matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware
for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection
which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.
Each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except
in such courts. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES A TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY AND ALL ISSUES ARISING IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THEM OR THEIR
SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF ITS PROVISIONS OR ANY NEGOTIATIONS IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

 

(d) In the event that any claim(s) of inconsistency between this Agreement and
the terms of the Merger Agreement arise, as they may from time to time be
amended, the terms of the Merger Agreement shall control, except with respect
to duties, liabilities and rights, including compensation and indemnification,
of the Escrow Agent, which shall be controlled by the terms of this
Agreement.

The headings of the Sections of this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience and shall not modify, define, limit or expand the
express provisions of this Agreement.

(f) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder of parties hereto
may not be assigned except with the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of each Partys respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
expressly provided herein, no other person shall acquire or have any rights
under or by virtue of this Agreement. This Agreement is intended to be for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto, and (subject to the provisions of this
_Section 12(f))_ their respective successors and assigns, and none of the
provisions of this Agreement are intended to be, nor shall they be construed
to be, for the benefit of any third person.

 

(g) The Escrow Agent makes no representation as to the validity, value,
genuineness or the collectability of any security or other document
or instrument held by or delivered to it.

(h) The Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise any party as to the
wisdom in selling or retaining or taking or refraining from any action with
respect to any securities or other property deposited hereunder.

(i) It is understood that the Escrow Agent shall be responsible for income
reporting only with respect to income earned on the Escrow Account and will
not be responsible for any other reporting.

 

(j) This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be enforceable against the parties actually executing such
counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument. A
facsimile, telecopy, PDF or other reproduction of this Agreement may be
executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party by
facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the
signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen. Any such facsimile,
telecopy, PDF or other reproduction shall be deemed an original. Such
execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for
all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to
execute and deliver an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile,
telecopy or other reproduction hereof.

 



14 (k) The rights and remedies conferred upon the parties hereto shall be
cumulative, and the exercise or waiver of any such right or remedy shall not
preclude or inhibit the exercise of any additional rights or remedies. The
waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall not preclude the subsequent
exercise of such right or remedy.

 

(l) Each of Parent and the Securityholders Representative hereby represents
and warrants with respect to itself (i) that this Escrow Agreement has been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company, as
applicable, action, executed and delivered on their behalf and, assuming due
execution and delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against Parent and the
Securityholders Representative in accordance with its terms and (ii) that to
its knowledge the execution, delivery and performance of this Escrow Agreement
by it does not and will not violate any applicable law or regulation.

(m) In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
parties or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

(n) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day
other than a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal holiday in the State of California or
a day on which commercial banks in the State of California are required or
authorized to close.

 

(o) _Security Procedure for Funds Transfer_. Concurrent with the execution of
this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
authorized signers forms in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_ to
this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall confirm each funds transfer
instruction received in the name of Parties by confirming with an authorized
individual as evidenced in _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_. Once delivered to
the Escrow Agent, Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 may be revised or rescinded only
in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such
revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and
following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a
reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised _Exhibit  B-1_ or _Exhibit
B-2_ or a rescission of an existing _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit  B-2_ is
delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to
either party, such document shall be accompanied by additional documentation
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the
rights and responsibilities of the Parties. The Parties understand that the
Escrow Agents inability to receive or confirm funds transfer instructions
may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and agree that the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any such delay.

 



15 Section 13\. _USA PATRIOT Act Section 326 Customer Identification Program_.
The parties hereto acknowledge that in order to help the United States
government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities,
pursuant to Federal regulations that became effective on October 1, 2003
(Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act) requires all financial institutions to
obtain, verify, record and update information that identifies each person
establishing a relationship or opening an account. The parties to this
Agreement agree that they will provide to the Escrow Agent such information
as it may request, from time to time, in order for the Escrow Agent to satisfy
the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, including but not limited to the
name, address, tax identification number and other information that
will allow it to identify the individual or entity who is establishing the
relationship or opening the account and may also ask for formation documents
such as articles of incorporation or other identifying documents to be
provided to the Escrow Agent for these purposes.

16 _General Instructions_

 

THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCOMPANYING THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL SHOULD BE READ
CAREFULLY BEFORE THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND THE ACCOMPANYING TAX FORMS
ARE COMPLETED.



     |  |  | Holders of Company Securities: List all
certificate/option grant numbers and share numbers in the appropriate box on
Pages 1 and 2. You should complete one Letter of Transmittal listing all
Company Securities registered in the same name. If your stock certificate(s)
are lost, please check the appropriate box below the primary boxes, complete
the Letter of Transmittal and the enclosed Affidavit of Lost Certificate and
return the Letter of Transmittal and Affidavit of Lost Certificate to the
Paying Agent. You should complete one Letter of Transmittal listing all
Company Securities registered in the same name. If any Company Securities are
registered in different ways on several certificates, you will need to
complete, sign, and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there
are different registrations of certificates. You may not submit fewer than the
entire number of shares of Company Securities represented by a certificate.
Stock certificates need NOT be endorsed or accompanied by separate, stock
powers and the signature(s) need NOT be guaranteed. An Affidavit of Lost
Certificate, in the form attached as Annex B, must be completed in order to
effectively surrender a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s). For the
avoidance of doubt, you must return your stock certificate(s) with this Letter
of Transmittal to receive payment, unless the Paying Agent has received your
stock certificate directly from the Company and the Company has informed you
accordingly; however you do not need to deliver any Warrants you hold, if any. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Wire Instructions: To elect a bank wire transfer, please
provide the appropriate instructions herein on the page entitled "Payment
Instructions". Please contact your bank for questions regarding
the appropriate bank routing number and account number to be used. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Signatures: __ The signature on this Letter of
Transmittal must correspond exactly with the name(s) as written on the face of
any certificate(s) surrendered or converted unless the Shares have
been assigned by the registered holder or holders thereof, in which event
this Letter of Transmittal should be signed in exactly the same form as the
name(s) of the last transferee(s) indicated on the transfers attached to or
endorsed on the certificate(s). 
---|---|---|--- 

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a trustee, executor, administrator,
guardian, officer of a corporation, attorney-in-fact, or other person acting
in a fiduciary or representative capacity, the person signing must give his or
her full title in such capacity and enclose appropriate evidence of his or
her authority to so act.



     |  |  | IRS Form W-9 or Applicable IRS Form W-8: If your Company
Securities are accepted for payment, in order to prevent "backup withholding"
of federal income tax on the payment of the Consideration with respect to your
Company Securities, you must provide the Paying Agent with your correct TIN on
IRS Form W-9 (if you are a U.S. person (as defined in the instructions to the
enclosed IRS Form W-9)) or a properly completed and appropriate IRS Form W-8
(if you are not a U.S. Person (as defined in the instructions to the enclosed
IRS Form W-9)). If the Paying Agent is not provided with a properly completed
IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, you
may be subject to various penalties and backup withholding at the statutorily
imposed rate (currently 28%). 
---|---|---|--- 
 

To prevent backup withholding, if you are a U.S. person (as defined in the
instructions to the enclosed IRS Form W-9), you must provide your correct TIN
by completing the enclosed IRS Form W-9, and certify that (i) the TIN provided
is correct, (ii) (a) you are exempt from backup withholding, (b) you have not
been notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding as a
result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has
notified you that you are no longer subject to backup withholding, and (iii)
you are a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien), or otherwise
establish an adequate basis for exemption. If the Company Securities are held
in more than one name or not in the name of the actual owner, consult
the instructions to the enclosed IRS Form W-9 for information on which TIN to
report.

Certain Holders (including, among others, certain corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are exempt from these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. To prevent erroneous backup withholding, an exempt Holder who is
a U.S. Person (as defined in the instructions to the enclosed IRS Form W-9)
must enter the appropriate "Exempt payee code" in box 4 on IRS Form W-9. See
the instructions to the enclosed IRS Form W-9 for additional instructions.
Exempt Holders who are not U.S. Persons (as defined in the instructions to the
enclosed IRS Form W-9) must submit a properly completed and appropriate IRS
Form W-8, signed under penalties of perjury attesting to such exempt status.
An IRS Form W-8BEN and an IRS Form W-8BEN-E are enclosed. Other IRS Forms W-8
may be obtained from the IRS at _www.irs.gov_. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the
federal income tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding will
be reduced by the amount of tax withheld provided that the required
information is properly furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained
provided that the required information is properly furnished to the IRS in a
timely manner.

TO PREVENT BACKUP WITHHOLDING ON PROCEEDS, EACH HOLDER SHOULD COMPLETE AND
PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH THE ENCLOSED IRS FORM W-9 (FOR PAYEES THAT ARE U.S.
PERSONS, INCLUDING U.S. RESIDENT ALIENS) OR AN APPROPRIATE IRS FORM W-8 (FOR
PAYEES THAT ARE NOT U.S. PERSONS). CONSULT THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ENCLOSED
IRS FORM W-9 FOR THE DEFINITION OF "U.S. PERSON."

 _Lost Securities Surety Premium/Service Fee Calculation_

 

 _The following formula should be used to calculate the surety premium, if
any, and service fee that you must submit with this Letter of Transmittal._

1\. _Calculate the share value of the lost securities by multiplying the
number of shares that are lost by the applicable Cash Rate:_



     | _A._  | _Enter the number of share(s) of Cyence Inc. Capital
Stock lost  _   _ X (Bond Premium
Rate) _$ __[ ●] __ _=  _ _ share value_ __ 
---|---|--- 
 



     | _B._  | _Add Processing fee of $80.00_ 
---|---|--- 



     | _C._  | _Add the totals listed in Items A and B $ _
  _. _ 
---|---|--- 

Multiply the number of shares lost by the Safeco Insurance Company of America
Bond premium noted above to calculate the premium you owe. If you have Lost
Securities representing [TBD] or fewer shares, there is a minimum premium of
$20.00. There is also a processing fee of $80.00. PLEASE MAKE YOUR CHECK
PAYABLE TO "COMPUTERSHARE" FOR THE BOND PREMIUM AND PROCESSING FEE AND
ENCLOSE WITH THIS AFFIDAVIT. If your request is approved, Computershare will
forward the Bond premium to Safeco Insurance Company of America. We cannot
complete your exchange without a Surety Bond. NOTE: This premium is
calculated based upon each lost share, not per each lost certificate.

EXACTLY below as the name(s) appear on the front of this form.

If your lost certificates are held by a trust or are part of an estate, or
are valued at more than $250,000, please contact Computer share for
