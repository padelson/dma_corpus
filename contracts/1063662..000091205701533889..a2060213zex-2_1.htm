 B. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with Delaware law, the board of directors of Company has unanimously (i) declared this Agreement to be advisable, (ii) approved this Agreement and approved and authorized the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) determined that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Company and fair to, and in the best interests of, Company and its stockholders and (iv) determined to recommend that the stockholders of Company adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger. 

  

 C.

 D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition of and inducement to the willingness of Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, certain affiliates of Company are entering into a voting agreement with Acquiror in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a "Voting Agreement" and collectively, the "Voting Agreements"), and an affiliate agreement with Acquiror in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (each, an "Affiliate Agreement" and collectively, the "Affiliate Agreements").

 (a) _ Conversion of Company Capital Stock._ Each share of capital stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Company (the "Company Capital Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Capital Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.6(b), will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section 2.6(e) and Section 2.6(f)) into the right to receive 0.571 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Genesis Delaware ("Genesis Delaware Common Stock"), upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.7 (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if

Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested
or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement
with Company, then the shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Capital Stock will also be unvested or
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Genesis Delaware Common
Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Company shall take
all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Genesis Delaware is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Company-Owned and Genesis Delaware-Owned Company Capital Stock._ Each share of Company Capital Stock held by Company, Genesis Delaware or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or Genesis Delaware (including, without limitation, Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (c) _ Stock Options._ Each option to purchase Company Capital Stock and stock appreciation rights then outstanding under any of Company\'s Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Plan (the "Company Option Plan"), whether vested or unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable (each, a "Company Stock Option" and collectively, the "Company Stock Options"), shall be assumed by Genesis Delaware in accordance with Section 6.8. Each purchase right outstanding under Company\'s Amended and Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be treated as set forth in Section 6.8. 

  

 (d) _ Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) _ Adjustments to Exchange Ratio._ The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Genesis Delaware Common Stock or Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Genesis Delaware Common Stock or Company Capital Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) _ Fractional Shares._ No fraction of a share of Genesis Delaware Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Genesis Delaware Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.7 (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.9), receive from Genesis Delaware an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) such fraction, and (y) the average closing price of Common Shares of Acquiror ("Acquiror Common Shares") for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately following the Effective Time beginning on the first full trading day immediately following the date upon which the Effective Time shall occur, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market System ("Nasdaq"). 

  

  2.7 _ Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Cash and Stock Consideration._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror or Genesis Delaware shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the Merger. 

  

 (b) _ Genesis Delaware to Provide Common Stock and Cash Consideration._ Genesis Delaware shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i) the shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Capital Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d). 

  

 (c) _ Exchange Procedures._ As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Acquiror or Genesis Delaware, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock into which their shares of Company Capital Stock were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.6, payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section 2.7(d) as to the payment of dividends, to evidence only the ownership of the number of full shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted pursuant to Section 2.6, the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and the right to receive any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Capital Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d). 

  

 (d) _ Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Genesis Delaware Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificate(s) with respect to the shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificate(s) shall surrender such Certificate(s). Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, a certificate(s) representing whole shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect to such whole shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock. 

  

    

  (e) _ Transfers of Ownership._ If any certificate representing shares
of Genesis Delaware Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Genesis Delaware or any
agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Genesis
Delaware or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

Company has provided or made available to Acquiror true, complete and correct copies of each of the Leases; no term or condition of any of the Leases has been modified, amended or waived except as shown in such copies; each of the Leases constitutes the entire agreement of the landlord and the tenant thereunder; and there are no other agreements or arrangements whatsoever relating to Company\'s use or occupancy of any of the premises described in any of the Leases.

There is no pending or, to Company\'s knowledge, threatened condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any Leased Property or any portion thereof, and Company has no knowledge that any such action is currently contemplated.

In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Company and its board of directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger and this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and this Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Acquiror or Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any, material business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

 (c) Acquiror shall give prompt notice to Company of any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Acquiror or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

     6.8 _ Company Stock Options; Company 401(k) Plan; Company ESPP;
Employee Benefit Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Company Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, Genesis Delaware shall assume all options to purchase Common Stock issued by Company pursuant to the Company Option Plans, whether vested or unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable. The Company\'s repurchase right with respect to any unvested shares of Company Common Stock shall be assigned to Genesis Delaware by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder of the outstanding Company Common Stock. Immediately after the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option at the Effective Time, such number of shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock as is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of such option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of each such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the exercise price of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The term, vesting schedule, and all of the other terms of the Company Options shall otherwise remain unchanged. It is the intention of the parties that the Company Options so assumed by Genesis Delaware qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Within 30 business days after the Effective Time, Genesis Delaware will issue to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of a Company Option assumed by Genesis Delaware a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by Genesis Delaware. 

  

 (b) _ 401(k) Plans._ Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Acquiror provides written notice to Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated). Unless Acquiror provides such written notice to Company, no later than five business days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall provide Acquiror with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company\'s board of directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Acquiror. Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Acquiror may reasonably require. 

  

 (c) _ Company ESPP._ The rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to any offering then underway under the Company ESPP shall be determined by treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of such offering and by making such other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering but otherwise treating such shortened offering as a fully effective and completed offering for all purposes under the Company ESPP. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall be exercised in accordance with Section 13(b) of the Company ESPP, and each share of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to such exercise shall by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.6(a), without issuance of certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to participants under the Company ESPP. As of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall be terminated. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall (i) provide Acquiror with evidence that the Company ESPP has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of Company\'s board of directors; the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior review and approval of Acquiror and (ii) take such 

  

    

 other actions (including, but not limited to, if appropriate, amending the
Company ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transaction
contemplated by this Section 6.8(c).

   

 (d) _ Employee Benefit Matters._ Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Acquiror shall take reasonable actions to ensure that all employees of Company continue participation in the same Company health and welfare plans and arrangements in effect prior to the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror may, in its sole discretion, terminate any such benefit plans and arrangements, _provided, however_ , that all employees of Company are provided with substantially equivalent levels of health and welfare benefits as those provided to similarly situated eligible employees of Acquiror. 

  

  

 6.9 _ Form S-8._ Within fifteen (15) days following the Effective Time, Genesis Delaware shall file, if available for use by Genesis Delaware, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form thereto) relating to Genesis Delaware Common Stock issuable pursuant to awards under the Company Option Plan assumed by Genesis Delaware pursuant to this Agreement. If required by applicable rules of the Nasdaq, Genesis shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Company Stock Options assumed by Genesis Delaware pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 6.10 _ Indemnification._ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Genesis Delaware will cause to be maintained in effect in all respects the current obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified parties thereunder (the "Indemnified Parties") as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Genesis Delaware will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company; _provided, however_ , that in no event will Genesis Delaware or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of one hundred and seventy five percent (175%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company. 

  

 (c) This Section 6.10 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its respective successors and assigns. In the event Genesis Delaware or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. 

  

 6.11 _ Nasdaq Listing._ Acquiror agrees to cause Genesis Delaware to authorize for listing on Nasdaq the shares of Genesis Delaware Common Stock issuable, and those required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, upon official notice of issuance.

Company and Acquiror each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; provided, however, that Acquiror shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Acquiror or the Company or any of Acquiror\'s subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Acquiror or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company, its affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock (assuming for purposes of determining materiality in this Section 6.13 that the Merger shall have been effected). 

  

 6.14 _ Restructuring of Acquiror._ As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Acquiror shall prepare and shall file with the SEC and such other governmental regulatory authorities as may be required by law a document or documents that will constitute a prospectus and proxy statement necessary to effect the Restructuring in accordance with Annex I hereto.
