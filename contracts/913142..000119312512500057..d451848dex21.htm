Because the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is more than Thirty Nine
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US $39,500,000) (the " _Target Net

(b) As used herein, the following terms shall have the definitions set forth
below:

 

(i) The term " _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the positive or negative
difference between the combined Current Assets of the Acquired Companies (as
defined in _Schedule 1.3_ hereto) minus the combined Current Liabilities of
the Acquired Companies (as defined in _Schedule 1.3_ hereto).

 

(ii) The term " _Closing Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the Net Working
Capital of the Acquired Companies as of the close of business Eastern Time on
the Closing Date.

(c) Within sixty (60) calendar days of the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to the Seller Representative unaudited combined balance sheets of
the Acquired Companies as of the close of business Eastern Time on the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and shall include a

_Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
(x) fairly present the combined Current Assets and Current Liabilities of the
Acquired Companies of the close of business Eastern Time on the Closing Date
in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of
the Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined) and _Schedule 1.3_. The
Closing Net Working Capital shall be calculated in the manner described on
_Schedule 1.3_ hereto based upon amounts reflected in the Closing Balance

2 (d) The Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i)
the date the Seller Representative notifies Buyer of its acceptance of the
Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital or
(ii) the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following Seller RepresentativeÂ’s
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, unless the Seller Representative
notifies Buyer in writing prior to such date of its disagreement with any
aspect of the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If delivered, the Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the amount, nature and basis
of any such disagreement, including the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s own proposed
adjustments to BuyerÂ’s calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer within thirty (30) calendar days
of the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement, then the Closing Net Working Capital amount shall become final and
binding only upon the earlier of (A) the date that Buyer and the Seller
Representatives resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, or (B) the date any
disputed matters are finally resolved through accounting arbitration pursuant
to _Section 1.3(e)_; _provided_ that in no event shall Closing Net Working
Capital be less than BuyerÂ’s calculation of Closing Net Working Capital set
forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement or more than the Seller
RepresentativeÂ’s calculation of Closing Net Working Capital set forth on
a Notice of Disagreement.

(e) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly and timely delivered pursuant
to  _Section 1.3(d)_, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall, during the
thirty (30) days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith in respect
of the disputed items. If the Seller Representative and Buyer are unable to
resolve any such dispute during such period, the dispute shall be referred to
Grant Thornton LLP or any other independent accounting firm of national
standing agreed upon by the Seller Representative and Buyer (the "
_Independent Firm_ ") for definitive resolution. The Independent Firm shall
set forth the procedures for the presentation of evidence (unless Buyer and
Seller Representative otherwise agree on the procedures for the presentation
of evidence) and shall make its determination and calculation with respect to
such dispute in a written report to be delivered to Buyer and Seller
Representative within thirty (30) calendar days of its appointment or as soon
as commercially practicable. In making such calculation, the Independent Firm
shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or
BuyerÂ’s calculation of Closing Net Working Capital as to which Seller
Representative have disagreed and shall not conduct an independent review.
The Independent Firm shall act as an arbitrator, and, subject to the proviso
at the end of _Section 1.3(d)_, its determination shall be final and
conclusive as between the parties, absent fraud or manifest error. All fees
and expenses of the Independent Firm shall be borne (i) by Buyer if the
difference between the Closing Net Working Capital (as determined by the
Independent Firm) and BuyerÂ’s calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital
set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement is greater than the
difference between the Closing Net Working Capital (as determined by the
Independent Firm) and the Seller RepresentativeÂ’s calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, (ii) by the
Seller Representative if the first such difference is less than the second
such difference, and (iii) if such differences are equal, then equally by
Buyer on the one hand, and the Seller Representative on the other hand.

 



3 (f) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Net Working Capital amount
becomes final and binding pursuant to _Section 1.3(d)_ or _Section 1.3(e)_,
if the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, then Seller Representative and Buyer shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay the amount of such difference to Buyer from the Working
Capital Escrow Amount in immediately available funds to an account designated
by Buyer and to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the remainder of the Working
Capital Escrow Amount in immediately available funds to an account designated
by the Seller Representative, provided, however, that, if the difference
between the Closing Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital is greater than the Working Capital Escrow Amount, then Seller
Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the entire
Working Capital Escrow Amount in immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer and Sellers shall be liable to Buyer for the remainder of
such shortfall. If the Closing Net Working Capital is more than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay the amount of such
difference to Sellers in immediately available funds to the accounts
designated by Sellers and instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the entire Working
Capital Escrow Amount in immediately available funds to any account designated
by the Seller Representative. Any payment made pursuant to _Section 1.3(f)

agreements (written or oral) with any other Senior Executive relating to
the provision of services of or to any of the Acquired Companies, bonus
payments, severance obligations or deferred compensation.

 

(b) _Schedule 2.8(b)_ sets forth a complete list of each "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), and each plan, agreement, practice,

(within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) and (o) of the Code, such
persons being referred to as " _Related Persons_ "), for the

 



12  benefit of current or former employees, officers, directors or other service
providers of the Acquired Companies, or with respect to which the Acquired
Companies have any liability (contingent or otherwise) (each of the preceding
hereinafter is referred to individually as an "Employee Benefit Plan" and
collectively as the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "). A current, correct and
complete copy of all documents which comprise each Employee Benefit Plan
(including the most recent summary plan descriptions), and all related trust
agreements, funding agreements, and service agreements have been made
available to Buyer by Sellers.

 

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.8(c)_ , no Employee Benefit Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, no Employee Benefit
Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA or
Section 3(37) of ERISA, and no Acquired Company or Related Person maintains or
contributes to, or has ever maintained or contributed to, an employee pension
benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (" _Title IV Plan_ "), including,
without limitation, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) or
4001(a) of ERISA. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)
of ERISA), no Seller, Acquired Company or Related Person has any actual or
potential withdrawal liability (including, without limitation, any contingent
liability) from any complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections
4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from any such multiemployer plan.

 

(d) Each of the Employee Benefit Plans that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Plans_ ") is the subject of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS to such effect, and to the
Knowledge of Sellers, nothing has occurred, whether by action or inaction,
which could cause any such plan to not be so qualified. Each Employee Benefit
Plan is in material compliance with, and has been maintained and operated in
all material respects with, the requirements of applicable Laws and its
governing documents. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such
term is defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and the guidance
thereunder) under which the Company makes, is obligated to make or promises to
make, payments (each, a " _409A Plan_ ") are and have been operated
in reasonable good faith compliance, in both form and operation, with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the applicable guidance
thereunder. No payment to be made under any 409A Plan, to SellersÂ’ Knowledge
will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

(e) All contributions and premiums required by applicable Laws or to be made
by the terms of or with respect to any Employee Plan have been or will be

have been and are reflected in the Financial Statements or the books and
records of the Acquired Companies for periods of time after the date of the
Current Balance Sheet.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.8(f)_ , none of the Employee Benefit
Plans or Service Agreements provide for continuing welfare benefits or
coverage, or other non-pension benefits, to any retired or other former
employee, officer, director, service provider, participant or any beneficiary
of a participant except as may be required by the continuation coverage
requirements of Sections 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("
_COBRA_ ").

 

(g) There is no contract, plan or arrangement covering any current or former
employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Acquired
Companies that,

 



13  individually or collectively, as a result of or in conjunction with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, could give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible by the applicable Acquired Company by
reason of Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.8(g)_
and with respect to the Employee Transaction Bonus Amount, the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or together with any other event which, standing alone, would
not by itself trigger such entitlement or acceleration) will not (1) entitle
any Person to any payment, severance, forgiveness of indebtedness,
distribution, or increase in benefits under or with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan or Service Agreement or (2) otherwise trigger any acceleration
(of vesting or payment of benefits or otherwise) under or with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan or Service Agreement.

(h) No "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (other
than reportable events for which the notice period has been waived under the

meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has occurred with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan and no Tax, penalty or liability has been
imposed or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, could reasonably be expected to be
imposed, pursuant to Section 4975 or Section 4976 of the Code or Title I of
ERISA in respect thereof. Neither any Seller nor any Acquired Company has
incurred any material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(the " _PBGC_ "). With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan: (i) no filing,
application or other matter is pending with the Internal Revenue Service, the
PBGC, the United States Department of Labor or any other governmental body,
and (ii) there are no outstanding liabilities for Taxes, penalties or fees. 

(i) The Sellers, Acquired Companies and Related Persons have not filed notice
of intent to terminate any "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2)(A) of
ERISA) or adopted any amendment to treat any such plan as terminated.

(j) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan covering US employees, such
Employee Benefit Plan permits the Sellers or Acquired Companies to amend or
terminate the Employee Benefit Plan at any time and without any liability, or
permits the Sellers or Acquired Companies to terminate its participation in
such Employee Benefit Plan at any time and without any liability, except for
claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination, as may be required
under applicable Laws, vested benefits which cannot be modified, and for
administrative expenses associated with such termination or amendment.

injunctions, decrees, rulings or assessments of any Governmental Entity, or
any arbitration awards, relating to employment, equal opportunity,
nondiscrimination, immigration, sexual harassment, wages, hours,
benefits, collective bargaining, the payment of social security and similar
taxes, income tax withholding, and/or privacy rights of employees. Except as

Acquired Company is being conducted in compliance in all material respects
with all existing federal, state and local constitutions, codes, acts,
treaties, statutes, laws, ordinances, orders, judgments, rules or regulations

investigation for, the violation of any Laws, including any Laws relating to
employment practices, terms, and conditions of employment, equal employment

being rendered invalid or unenforceable. 

(f) No Invention Disclosure describes any invention that has been publicly
disclosed or offered for sale creating a bar to filing patent applications

Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Straddle Period and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income
and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be equal to the amount of Tax which
would be payable for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date if such portion were a complete Tax period and the Pre-Closing
Tax Period ended on and included the Closing Date (determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business Eastern Time on the
Closing Date). All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation
set forth in the foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent
with prior practice of the Companies (unless otherwise required by Law). All
other Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period shall be attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(viii) " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ " shall mean a Tax Return filed with
respect to a Straddle Period.

(d) Buyer shall not, nor shall it permit any Acquired Company to, file any
amended Tax Return for any period relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that the Seller
Representative shall consent if Buyer agrees to reimburse Sellers for adverse
financial impact.

(e) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing of
any Tax Return (including any report required pursuant to Section 6043A of the

litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Buyer and Sellers
further agree, upon request, to use all reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or
customer of the Acquired Companies or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including but not
limited to with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). 

(f) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid. To the extent any such amounts are so
withheld, Buyer shall pay such amount to the applicable Governmental Entity
and shall provide Seller with a receipt for the amounts paid to a Governmental
Entity.

 

(g) At BuyerÂ’s request, PPC and each Seller shall join with Buyer in making a
Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to the purchase and sale of the PPC

other tax items resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on their Tax
Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Sellers shall also pay any
Tax imposed on PPC attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10)

income Tax Laws (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_ ") in a manner
consistent with the Section 338 Allocation. Buyer and the Sellers shall
timely file such Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable Taxing
Authorities. Buyer and the Sellers agree that none of them shall revoke the
Section 338(h)(10) Election following the filing of the Section 338(h)(10)
Forms without the prior written consent of Buyer or the Sellers, as the case
may be. Buyer and the Sellers shall (i) file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Section 338(h)(10) Forms
and the Section 338 Allocation and (ii) take no position contrary thereto in
connection with any Tax Proceeding or otherwise. Buyer shall deliver to the
Sellers, and the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer, at Closing one or more
duly executed IRS Forms 8023 (and any similar forms under state, local or
non-U.S. Law) that reflect the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(h) If Buyer wishes to make an election(s) under section 338(g) of the Code
(or any corresponding election under state, local, or non-U.S. law) for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall make such elections
only for the SKT Shares, the shares of St. Kitts Technology Limited, a company
organized under the laws of St. Kitts, and the shares of BiBiXi Communications
System (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of China. If
Buyer makes such elections with respect to any one of these shares, Buyer
shall make the elections for all of the SKT Shares, the shares of St. Kitts
Technology Limited and the shares of BiBiXi Communications System (Suzhou)
Co., Ltd. 

(i) PPC and Sellers shall not revoke PPCÂ’s election to be taxed as an S
corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code. PPC and
Sellers shall not take or allow any action other than the sale of PPCÂ’s stock
pursuant to this agreement that would result in the termination of PPCÂ’s
status as a validly election S corporation within the meaning of sections
1361 and 1362 of the Code.

(j) All Tax Sharing Agreements with respect to or involving any of
the Acquired Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and after
the Closing Date none of the Acquired Companies shall be bound thereby or have
any liability thereunder.

 

Section 4.5 _Preservation of Records_. Sellers and Buyer agree that each of
them shall preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
business of the Acquired Companies for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel available to the others
as may be reasonably required by any party in connection with, among other
things, any Tax audits, any insurance claims by or legal proceedings against
or governmental investigations of Sellers or Buyer or any of their Affiliates
or in order to enable Sellers or Buyer to comply with their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. The party requesting such records
will reimburse the nonrequesting party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the nonrequesting party. The nonrequesting party
will afford access to such records during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice given by the requesting party, and subject to such
reasonable limitations as the nonrequesting party may impose to delete
competitively sensitive or privileged information.

 



33 Section 4.6 _Mail and Communications_. Sellers shall promptly remit to Buyer
any mail or other communications received by Sellers exclusively with respect
to the Acquired Companies from and after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
promptly remit to Sellers any mail or other communications of Sellers received
by Buyer or the Acquired Companies from and after the Closing Date.

Section 4.7 _Directors and Officers; Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) Buyer and the Acquired Companies agree that, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, (i) all rights to indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Acquired Companies, including as may
be provided in the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other constituent
documents of the Acquired Companies, or in any agreements between the Acquired
Companies and any current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Acquired Companies, will survive the Closing and will continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of not less
than six (6) years after the Closing Date (or, in the case of any agreement,
in accordance with its terms), (ii) all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or
former managers, directors, officers or employees of the Acquired Companies
shall be presently vested contractual rights and shall not hereafter be
eliminated or limited in any way whatsoever and (iii) with respect to any
right to indemnification or advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall be the
indemnitors of first resort, responsible for all such indemnification or
advancement, without regard to any right to indemnification or advancement
that any manager, director, officer or employee of the Acquired Companies may
have from any other Person.

(b) As of the Closing, Buyer shall purchase, or cause the Acquired Companies
to purchase, "tail" coverage for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date under the directors and officers liability insurance policies of
the Acquired Companies, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "
_Tail D andO Policy_"), with coverage (including terms, conditions, retentions
and limitations of liability) at least as favorable as the coverage under the
existing Acquired CompaniesÂ’ policies. This _Section 4.7_ shall be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the current or former directors,
officers and employees of the Acquired Companies, and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators and estates. 

Section 4.8 _Confidentiality_.

(a) As used in this _Section 4.8_, the term " _Confidential Information_ "
includes any of the following information held or used by or relating to any
Acquired Company:

 

(i) all information that constitutes know-how, trade secrets, confidential or
proprietary information, customer lists, technical information, data, process
technology, plans, drawings, inventions, and discoveries whether or not
patentable (collectively, " _Trade Secrets_ ");

(ii) all information concerning product specifications, data, know-how,
formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches, photographs, graphs,
drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past, current, and planned research
and development, current and planned manufacturing or distribution methods and
processes, computer hardware, software and computer software, database

34 (iii) all information concerning the business and affairs of any Acquired
Company, including historical and current financial statements, financial
projections and budgets, tax returns and accountantsÂ’ materials, historical,
current, and projected sales, capital spending budgets and plans, business
plans, strategic plans, marketing and advertising plans, publications, client
and customer and prospect lists and files, current and anticipated customer
requirements, price lists, market studies, contracts, the names and
backgrounds of key personnel and personnel training techniques and materials,
however documented.

(b) Each Seller acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the
Confidential Information and agrees that such Seller and its trustees and
beneficiaries shall (i) keep the Confidential Information confidential and
deliver promptly to Buyer, or immediately destroy at BuyerÂ’s option, all
embodiments and copies of the Confidential Information that are in such
SellerÂ’s possession; (ii) not use the Confidential Information for any reason
or purpose; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the
Confidential Information to any Person, except with BuyerÂ’s consent.

(c) _Section 4.8(b)_ does not apply to any Confidential Information that (i)
in the event that the Sellers are required to disclose the Confidential
Information by law or regulation, or requested to do so by any Governmental
Entity, or in connection with any legal proceedings; (ii) is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
the Sellers in violation of this agreement, or (iii) is or becomes available
to the public on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Sellers
or their Affiliates. 

(d) If any Seller becomes compelled in any legal proceeding to make any
disclosure that is prohibited by this  _Section 4.8_, such Seller shall, to
the extent legally permissible, provide Buyer with prompt notice of such
compulsion so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section
4.8_. In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, such Seller may
disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information
that, based upon the opinion of such SellerÂ’s counsel, such Seller is legally
compelled to disclose; provided, however, that such Seller shall use its best
efforts to obtain written assurance that any Person to whom any Confidential
Information is so disclosed shall accord confidential treatment to such
Confidential Information.

under this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect after the date hereof
for a period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date; provided that the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_
, _2.4_ , _2.14(b)_ and _2.27_ ( _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.4, 2.14(b)_ and
_2.27_ being referred to herein as the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") and
of Buyer contained in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ shall survive the Closing and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby forever and the 

 



35  representations and warranties of Sellers contained in _Section 2.16 _(such

warranty, covenant or undertaking prior to such expiration.

Section 5.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to the restrictions and limitations
in this _Article V_, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify Buyer,
its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, shareholders, directors,
employees and agents (collectively, " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against and hold
them harmless from any loss, liability, damages, fines, penalties, judgments,
claims, causes of actions, obligations, awards, assessments, cost or expense
(including external costs of investigation reasonable legal fees and expenses)
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by such Buyer Indemnitees
to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Sellers contained in this Agreement or any document or certificate delivered
at Closing (but excluding any Ancillary Agreement), (ii) any breach of any
covenant or undertaking of Sellers contained in this Agreement, (iii) all Pre-
Closing Taxes, and (iv) any Closing Date Indebtedness not deducted from the
Initial Purchase Price or included in the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term " _Losses_ " for all purposes
under this Agreement shall not include, and no party shall be required to
indemnify or hold harmless any other party for, any lost profits, multiple
damages, restitution, mental or emotional distress, exemplary, consequential,
incidental, special or punitive damages, except those with respect to third
party claims.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and without limiting the
rights Buyer has under _Section 5.2(a)(i) _and the affirmative indemnities
contained in _Sections 5.2(a)(ii)_ , _5.2(a)(iii)_ and _5.2(a)(iv)_ no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification from Sellers (other than with
respect to the Fundamental Representations or claims made pursuant to
_Section 2.16_) pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the
cumulative amount of the Losses suffered or incurred by all Buyer Indemnitees
exceeds Four Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$4,200,000) in the
aggregate, and then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed such
amount (the " _Deductible Amount_ ").

(c) In no event shall SellersÂ’ aggregate liability under _Section 5.2(a)(i)_
exceed:

(i) with respect to claims made pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)(i)_ (other than
the Fundamental Representations or _Section 2.16_) (the " _Non-Fundamental
Representation Claims_ "), Fifty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
(US$51,500,000); and

 



36 (ii) with respect to claims made pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)(i)_ with respect
to Fundamental Representations or _Section 2.16_, an amount equal to the
Purchase Price _less_ any amounts paid with respect to Non-Fundamental
Representation Claims.

 

Section 5.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date and subject to the restrictions and
limitations in this _Article V_ , Buyer shall indemnify Sellers (" _Sellers
Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or
incurred by such Sellers Indemnitees to the extent arising from (i) any breach
of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (ii)
any breach of any covenant or undertaking of Buyer contained in this
Agreement, (iii) all Post-Closing Taxes, (iv) except with respect to any
matter for which Buyer is indemnified under _Section 5.2_ herein, the
operation of the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date, (v) any contracts
and guarantees described in _Section 4.7_ with respect to events arising from
and after Closing, (vi) the WARN Act or any similar foreign, state or local
Law arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (vii) any claims for severance or other termination benefits asserted
against any Sellers by any Employee who is terminated by Buyer or its
Affiliates from and after the Closing Date and who is not a Leased Employee
(as defined under the Employee Lease Agreement dated of even date herewith by
and between PPC and JM Wireless, LLC).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and without limiting the
rights Sellers have under the affirmative indemnities contained in _Sections
5.3(a)(ii)_ , _5.3(a)(iii)_ , _5.3(a)(iv)_ , _5.3(a)(v)_ , _5.3(a)(vi)_ and 
_5.3(a)(vii)_ no Sellers Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification from
Buyer pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to the
representation or warranties set forth in _Section 3.1_ and  _Section 3.2_)
unless and until the cumulative amount of the Losses suffered or incurred by
all Sellers Indemnitees exceeds the Deductible Amount in the aggregate, and
then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed such amount.  

(c) In no event shall BuyerÂ’s aggregate liability under _Section 5.3(a)(i)_
exceed:

 

(i) with respect to claims made pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_ (other than
the representation or warranties set forth in  _Section 3.1_ and _Section

(ii) with respect to claims made pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_ with respect
to representation or warranties set forth in  _Section 3.1_ and _Section
3.2_, an amount equal to the Purchase Price _less_ any amounts paid with
respect to other claims made pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_.

 

Section 5.4 _Single Recovery_. Any liability for indemnification under this
Article V shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the set of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking, or one or more
rights to indemnification, including any matter that has been taken
into account as a liability in calculating Closing Net Working Capital
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.3_ or for which any reserve has been
established in the Financial Statements or in the books and records of Sellers
in accordance with GAAP.

 



37 Section 5.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims premised in fraud or claims
for injunctive relief or specific performance, Buyer and Sellers each
acknowledge and agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective
Affiliates, that the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims relating
to breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and undertakings
contained in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article V. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
and Sellers hereby waive, for themselves and on behalf of their respective
Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights of rescission or similar remedies. Any and all claims for
indemnification made by Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 5.2_ shall
first be satisfied out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer make an
indemnification claim for a breach of representations set forth in _Section
2.14(b)_ which alleges that a tangible asset used in the Business was
improperly transferred out of an Acquired Company in connection with the
Wireless Restructuring, then Sellers shall have the right to cure such breach
by promptly re-conveying such tangible asset to such Acquired Company at no
cost to such Acquired Company.

Section 5.6 _Indemnification Procedures_. If there occurs an event or
occurrence (including any claim asserted or action or proceeding commenced by
a third party) which any party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") asserts
constitutes an indemnifiable event pursuant to  _Sections 5.2_ or _5.3_ ,
the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice to the party obligated to
provide indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), setting forth
the nature of the claim and the basis for indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Party shall give such written notice to the Indemnifying Party,
with respect to third party claims, promptly after it becomes aware of the
existence of any such event or occurrence and, with respect to all claims
that are not third party claims, promptly after determining in good faith that
the Indemnified Party intends to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder.
Such notice shall be a condition precedent to any liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
provide prompt notice as provided herein will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If a party receives
written notice under this Article V and does not agree that it is required to
indemnify (and, with respect to a third party claim, action or proceeding to
defend) the party giving such notice, it shall give notice of the same (an "
_Objection Notice_ ") within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice of
the claim. In the event that the parties cannot agree whether such claim is
indemnified hereunder within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the
Objection Notice, then the parties shall be free to pursue other available
legal remedies to resolve such dispute. If no Objection Notice is received
within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the party receiving notice of a
claim shall be deemed to have acknowledged liability for indemnity for the
relevant claim. In case any third-party action shall be brought against any
Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of
the commencement thereof and its claim for indemnification with respect
thereto pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate therein at its sole cost and expense.
The Indemnifying Party, to the extent that it wishes, may assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by it and, after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of such election so to assume the defense
thereof, provided that the Indemnifying Party has not denied its
responsibility to

 



38  indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder in the entirety with respect to
such matter or in any way reserved any right to contest its duty to defend and
indemnify the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
undertakes the defense of the Indemnified Party without a denial of indemnity
or defense or a reservation of rights with respect to indemnity or defense,
the Indemnified Party may participate in such action and employ separate
counsel of its choice with the cost of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s separate
counsel borne by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if such Objection
Notice relates to a claim for an injunction against any business
or operations of the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to retain control of the defense of such claim with counsel selected
by it at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (and the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled only to participate in the defense of such claim, at its
sole cost and expense through counsel of its own choice). The Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate fully with (and to provide all relevant, non-
privileged documents and records and make all relevant personnel available
to) the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense of any such asserted
claim at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party shall
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld or delayed, unless such judgment or settlement includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each
Indemnifying Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim.
No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this Article V for any settlement,
compromise or discharge of any claim effected without its consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnifying Party
shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
without the prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such judgment
or settlement and such third-party claim, (ii) such judgment or settlement
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of an express, complete and unconditional
release from all liability in respect to such claim; and (iii) the entry of
such judgment or settlement does not impose non-monetary obligations on
the Indemnified Party or otherwise prejudice the business or property
interests of the Indemnified Party.

Section 5.7  _Adjustments for Insurance and Taxes_. Each Loss which an
Indemnifying Party is required to pay pursuant to this _Article V_ shall (i)
be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party and (ii) be reduced or increased, as
applicable, to take account of any reduction of net Taxes or increase in net
Taxes actually realized by the Indemnified Party as a direct result of such
Loss (determined after properly taking into account the actual and reasonably
anticipated effect on (including increase of) Taxes (including future Taxes)
of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof as a result of any
indemnification amount paid or payable for such Loss under this _Article V_
and any reasonable additional cost incurred to realize such net reduction in
Taxes).

 

Section 5.8 _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for
any indemnification claim pursuant to this  _Article V_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates may have against any other Persons
with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and
the Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably require to perfect such subrogation or to pursue such rights
against such other Persons as the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
may have.

 



39 Section 5.9 _Treatment of Indemnity Claims_. Any indemnification payment
by Sellers pursuant to this _Article V_ shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price hereunder.

 

Section 5.10 _Materiality_. In order to determine the amount of any Loss in
connection with a claim for Indemnification for breach of representation and
warranty pursuant to _Sections 5.2(a)(i)_ or _5.3(a)(i)_ , all qualifications
or exceptions included in such representations or warranties relating to
Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar qualifications shall be
disregarded.
