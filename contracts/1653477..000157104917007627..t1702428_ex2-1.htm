Buyer such Transferred Contract or Permit, without any conditions to such
transfer or changes or modifications of terms thereunder and (ii) in respect

assign in part or sublicense such Contract to the Buyer or one or more
designees of the Buyer, as applicable, or (B) if such Contract does not

(c) If any Transferred Contract or Shared Contract cannot be so
assigned or sublicensed by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be amended, or
if such assignment, sublicense or amendment would impair the benefit the
parties thereto derive from such Transferred Contract or Shared Contract,
then, for a period of time not to exceed twelve (12) months from the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates to, take such other reasonable and permissible actions (including
(x) entering into a subcontracting arrangement with the other party governing
the parties' relative obligations under the Transferred Contract or Shared
Contract and (y) providing prompt notice to the other party with respect to
any relevant claim of Liability or other relevant matters arising in
connection with a Transferred Contract or Shared Contract so as to allow such
other party the ability to exercise any applicable rights under such
Transferred Contract or Shared Contract) to cause (i) the Buyer to receive
the rights and benefits, and to bear the burden of the corresponding
Liabilities (including any Liabilities that may arise by reason of such
arrangement), of such Transferred Contract or portion of such Shared Contract
to the extent relating to the Business, as applicable, and (ii) the Seller to
receive the rights and benefits, and to bear the burden of the corresponding

assets owned by, and/or Liabilities of, as applicable, such party, beginning
upon the Closing Date, and (ii) neither report nor take any tax position (on a
Tax Return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment (unless required by
applicable Law). Nothing herein is intended to create a partnership, joint
venture, agency, or other relationship creating fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary
duties or similar duties and obligations or to subject the parties to joint
and several or vicarious liability or to impose any duty, obligation, or
Liability that would arise therefrom.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall require any party hereto to
make any payment, incur any obligation or grant any concession for the
benefit of (i) in the case of the Seller and Seller Parent, the Buyer and (ii)
in the case of the Buyer, the Seller and Seller Parent, in order to effect
any transaction contemplated by this _Section 2.5_, _provided_ that the
parties agree that the intent of this _Section 2.5_ is to permit Buyer to
obtain, subject to the provisions hereof, the benefit of Transferred Contract
or Shared Contract (to the extent relating to the Business) that cannot be
assigned to the Buyer and the parties will work in good faith to ensure that
any required payments in respect of Transferred or Shared Contracts are
timely made and in accordance with _Section 5.12_.

to (a) $315,000,000, _plus_  (b) the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus,

disagreement, setting forth the basis of such disagreement in reasonable
detail and the adjustment, in the Buyer's opinion, that should be made to the

Adjustment Statement and/or any of the components thereof or calculations
therein.

_Purchase Price Adjustment_ ".

  



  

(b) No later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller Parent a
statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") which includes (i) a balance sheet
of the Business as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ")
and (ii) the Buyer's good faith calculation of (A) the Net Working Capital of

Sheet or to address any dispute described in this _Section 2.11(b)_ and (y)

(c) Seller Parent and Buyer will conduct a joint physical count of

measure changes in Net Working Capital without the introduction of new or
different accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures,
classifications, judgments or estimation methodologies from the guidelines set
forth on _Schedule 1.1(d)_. The Adjustment Statement and the calculation of
the Net Working Capital contained therein shall entirely disregard (I)
any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Business as a result
of the transactions contemplated hereby or of any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by the Buyer or any other transaction
entered into by the Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (II) any of the plans, transactions or
changes which the Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated
or made after the Closing with respect to the Business, or any facts or
circumstances that are unique or particular to the Buyer or any of its assets
or liabilities.

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Seller Parent shall, within thirty (30) days following its
receipt of the Adjustment Statement, accept or reject in writing the
Adjustment Statement submitted by the Buyer. If Seller Parent disagrees with
the Adjustment Statement or the calculation of any component thereof, it
shall give written notice to the Buyer of such dispute and the specific items
and amounts to which Seller Parent objects within such period, including an
alternative calculation thereof (such notice, a " _Dispute Notice_ "). Should
Seller Parent fail to deliver to the Buyer a Dispute Notice within such
30-day period, Seller Parent shall be deemed to agree with the Buyer's
calculations. In the event Seller Parent delivers a Dispute Notice, the Buyer
and Seller Parent shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any
resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. If Seller Parent and the Buyer are unable
to reach a resolution with such effect within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by the Buyer of Seller Parent's Dispute Notice, Seller Parent and the
Buyer shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to Deloitte
and Touche LLP or, if such Person is unwilling or unable to serve, by a
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon in writing by
Seller Parent and the Buyer (such identified or selected firm, the "
_Independent Accountant_ "). The Independent Accountant shall determine,
based solely on the submissions by Seller Parent and Buyer, and not by
independent review, only those items set forth in the Dispute Notice (and
those raised by the Buyer in response thereto) that remain in dispute, and
shall determine a value for any such disputed item which is equal to or
between the final values for such disputed item proposed by the Buyer and
Seller Parent in their respective submissions. No discovery will be permitted
and no arbitration hearing will be held. The parties hereto shall request
that the Independent Accountant issue its report as to all matters in dispute
(and only such matters) and the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment
as soon as possible, but in any event within thirty (30) days after such
dispute is referred to the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant
shall not have the power to modify or amend any term or provision of this
Agreement. The Buyer on the one hand, and Seller Parent on the other hand,
shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with such
arbitration, except that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
hereunder shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller Parent, on
the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accountant that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed
items so submitted. This provision for arbitration shall be specifically
enforceable by the parties hereto and the decision of the Independent
Accountant in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be final and binding
with respect to the matters so arbitrated and there shall be no right of
appeal therefrom.

  



  

(e) The Purchase Price Adjustment shall be deemed final for the
purposes of this _Section 2.11_ upon the earliest of (i) the failure of the
Seller to deliver to the Buyer a Dispute Notice within the prescribed period
set forth in _Section 2.11(d)_ , (ii) the resolution of all disputes set
forth in any such Dispute Notice, pursuant to _Section 2.11(d)_ , by the
Seller and the Buyer or (iii) the resolution of all disputes set forth in any
such Dispute Notice, pursuant to _Section 2.11(d)_ , by the Independent
Accountant. The Purchase Price Adjustment included in such final Adjustment
Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto for the
purposes of this _Section 2.11_.

  



    

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Upon finalization of the Adjustment Statement, the following
adjustments will be made:

  



  

(i) If the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time as finally
agreed in accordance with _Section 2.11(e)_ is greater than the Estimated
Net Working Capital _plus_ $250,000 (the amount of the difference between the
Net Working Capital as finally agreed and the Estimated Net Working Capital
being the " _Net Working Capital Surplus_ "), then the Closing Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to the Net Working Capital Surplus
and the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, within three Business Days of
the finalization to the Seller an amount equal to such Net Working Capital
Surplus by wire transfer in immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Seller; and

  



  

(ii) If the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time as finally
agreed in accordance with _Section 2.11(e)_ is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital _minus_ $250,000 (the positive amount of such difference
between the Net Working Capital as finally agreed and the Estimated Net
Working Capital being the " _Net Working Capital Deficit_ "), then the
Closing Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to the
Net Working Capital Deficit and Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, within
three Business Days, to the Buyer an amount equal to such Net Working Capital
Deficit by wire transfer in immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Buyer.

  



  

(g) If the Purchase Price Adjustment is zero (i.e. the Net Working
Capital as of the Effective Time as finally agreed in the
Adjustment Statement is equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital), there
will be no payment required pursuant to this _Section 2.11_.

  



  

2.12 _Withholding_. The Buyer, its agents and any other Person
required to make a payment under this Agreement shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payment under any applicable Tax Law; _provided_ that, if the Buyer (or
any such agent or other Person) determines that an amount is required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to any such payment, the Buyer will
provide the Seller with written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold
reasonably in advance of making such payment, and the Buyer will reasonably
cooperate with the Seller to seek to eliminate or reduce the basis for such
deduction or withholding (including by providing the Seller with a reasonable
opportunity to provide forms or other evidence that would establish an
exemption from withholding). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

5.3 _Update of Disclosure Schedules; Knowledge of Breach_. The
Seller shall have the right from time to time prior to the Closing to
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or discovered which if existing or known at the date of
this Agreement would have been set forth or described in such Disclosure
Schedules and also with respect to events or conditions arising after the
date hereof and prior to Closing (a " _Schedule Update_ "); _provided_ that in
no event shall Seller have the right to update any Schedules required by
_Article I_ , _Article II_ and _Article V_ (other than to the extent
contemplated by _Section 5.6(a)_) of this Agreement. In the event that the
Seller provides any Schedule Update, the matters set forth on such Schedule
Update shall not be effective to cure and correct for purposes of _Article
VII_  any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made on the date
of this Agreement which would have existed if the Seller had not provided
such Schedule Update. In the event that prior to the Closing Date the Seller
provides to the Buyer notification pursuant to the terms of this _Section
5.3_ of the failure of any condition in _Article VII_ as a result of any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller due to facts
or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this Agreement that, but
for this _Section 5.3_ , would entitle Buyer to not consummate the Closing (a
" _Termination Update_ "), the Buyer may terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1_ (for the avoidance of doubt, without paying a
Termination Fee). If the Buyer proceeds to consummate the Closing after
receiving a Termination Update, the Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
and all rights, remedies or other recourse against the Seller to which Buyer
might otherwise be entitled in respect of a breach that would be cured by
such Termination Update, including any rights or remedies under _Article VIII_
, and such Termination Update shall be effective to cure and correct for all
other purposes any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
which would have existed if the Seller had not provided such Termination
Update, and all references to any Disclosure Schedule hereto which is
supplemented or amended as provided in this _Section 5.3_ shall for all
purposes after the Closing be deemed to be a reference to such Disclosure
Schedule as so supplemented or amended. If the Buyer proceeds to
consummate the Closing after receiving any Schedule Update that is not a
Termination Update, the Buyer shall be entitled to exercise any rights or
remedies pursuant to this Agreement in respect of a breach that would be cured
by such Schedule Update, including any rights or remedies under _Article
VIII_ , and such Schedule Update shall not be effective to cure and correct
for any purpose any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
which would have existed if the Seller had not provided such Schedule Update.

  



  

5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any fact,
change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ of this Agreement becoming incapable

5.6 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) _Business Employees_. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, but in any event, not less than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer employment (effective as of the
Closing) to each active Business Employee (it being understood that _Schedule
1.1(b)_ shall be modified (x) by the Seller for Business Employees who have
left employment or the replacement thereof or (y) by mutual agreement of the
Buyer and the Seller at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing to
reflect changes in the Persons comprising the Business Employees between the
date hereof and the date of such modification) whether salaried or hourly, in
a comparable job or position and geographic location as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (i) at a salary or wage level and bonus
opportunity that is comparable in the aggregate to the salary or wage
level and bonus opportunity to which such Business Employees were entitled
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) with benefits, perquisites and
other terms and conditions of employment that are at least as favorable in the
aggregate as the benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions that
similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates receive. All non-
active Business Employees shall be offered employment by the Buyer if they
return to active work within 180 days of the Closing Date, subject to each
such Business Employee providing Buyer (upon Buyer's request) with medical
certification that they are able to perform the essential functions of their
job with or without a reasonable accommodation. Business Employees who accept
such offers of employment from and actually commence employment with the
Buyer are referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_ ". The employment
of each Transferred Employee shall be deemed terminated with Seller as of the
date such employee commences employment with Buyer. The obligation of the
Buyer to provide the conditions of employment relating to pay, severance and
employee benefits in accordance with this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall continue
for a period ending not earlier than the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date. No later than the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall notify the Seller as to each Business
Employee who has accepted employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_, and each Business Employee who has
rejected the Buyer's offer of employment. The Buyer shall not assume any of
the Business Benefit Plans. The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller and its
Affiliates for any costs incurred related to severance payments payable to
the Business Employees solely as a result of the Buyer's failure to make an
offer of employment to such Business Employees in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Seller's consequent termination of such Business
Employee.

  



  

(b) _Service Credit_. With respect to each employee benefit plan,
policy and practice, including, without limitation, severance, vacation and
paid time off plans, policies and practices, sponsored or maintained by the
Buyer or its Affiliates, the Transferred Employees shall receive credit for
all periods of employment and/or service with the Seller and its Affiliates
(including service with predecessor employers, where such credit was provided
by the Seller or its Affiliates) prior to the Closing for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence benefits
and severance).

(c) _Employee Benefits -- General; COBRA_. Without limiting the
generality of _Section 5.6(a)_ , the Buyer agrees that (i) effective not
later than the Closing Date, the Buyer shall establish or have in effect
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in accordance
with this _Section 5.6_ , (ii) the Buyer will cause the Buyer Benefit Plans
to recognize all costs and expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees
(and their dependents and beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Closing
Date, for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment,
coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or
limitations on coverage under any such benefit plan, and, to the extent
required by Law, to waive any preexisting condition, evidence of insurability,
good health or actively-at-work exclusions for the Transferred Employees,
(iii) for the remainder of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs and
for the succeeding calendar year, the vacation and holiday plan offered to
Transferred Employees shall be comparable in the aggregate to what the Seller
or its Affiliates, as applicable, would have provided the Transferred
Employees had they remained employees of the Seller or its Affiliates, as the
case may be, and (iv) the Buyer shall have in effect for at least one
year starting on the Closing Date severance and retention plans, practices
and policies applicable to the Transferred Employees that are comparable in
the aggregate to such practices and policies in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date with respect to the Business Employees as set forth on
_Schedule 5.6(c)_. Seller shall retain all Liabilities to provide
continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601
of ERISA to Persons whose "qualifying event" occurs on or before the Closing,
including for any Transferred Employee or any former Business Employee and the
"qualified beneficiaries" of any such Transferred Employee or former Business
Employee. Seller shall pay to the Transferred Employees (x) accrued salary
and (y) bonuses in the ordinary course, in each case, as soon as practicably
possible after the Closing Date; _provided_ that, if the Closing occurs on or
after January 1, 2018, the Buyer shall pay all bonuses in respect of 2018 to
the Transferred Employees.

  



  

(d) _Defined Contribution and other Business Benefit Plans_. Each
Transferred Employee who is a participant in a defined contribution plan that
is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Seller Savings Plan_
"), a defined benefit plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a " _Seller Pension Plan_ "), or a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, a supplemental retirement plan or a performance unit plan (each, a "
_Specified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") shall cease to be an active
participant under each such plan effective as of the Closing Date. Effective
as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have in effect a defined contribution
plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code (the " _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") in which the Transferred Employees
shall be eligible to participate. The Seller and its Subsidiaries shall take
all actions necessary to fully vest Transferred Employees in their accrued
benefits in the Seller Savings Plan, Seller Pension Plan and each Specified
Deferred Compensation Plan _._ Each Transferred Employee who, prior to the
Closing, participated in the Seller Savings Plan shall be eligible to receive
a distribution of his or her account balance under the Seller Savings Plan in
accordance with applicable plan provisions, and to elect to roll over such
account (including any note representing any outstanding plan loan) into the
Buyer Savings Plan. As of or promptly after the Closing, the Seller shall make
to the Seller Savings Plan all employer contributions that would have been
made on behalf of such employees through the Closing Date, regardless of any
service or end of year employment requirements, but prorated for the portion
of the plan year that ends on the Closing Date in compliance with applicable
plan provisions.

regulation with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined

payments to enable the Buyer to pay one hundred percent (100%) of such

Closing, the Buyer shall assume the collective bargaining agreement between
the Seller and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers AFL-CIO, Local 1362 (the " _Union_ ") to the extent covering Business

this _Section 5.6_, the terms and conditions of employment of Transferred

solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and is not intended
to confer upon any other Persons any rights or remedies hereunder, including

5.8 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties shall hold, and shall
cause its Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of the other party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2017, between the Buyer
and Seller Parent, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time (and
only upon the Closing) such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of
the parties under this _Section 5.8_ shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_
, that after the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
only in respect of that portion of the documents and materials referenced

from and after the Closing, except as would have been permitted under the

shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, treat and hold as
confidential, and not disclose to any Person all information (including such
information provided pursuant to _Section 5.2_ ) furnished or provided by the
Seller, or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives to the

commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the three (3) year anniversary
of the Closing Date, Seller and Seller Parent will, and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, hold, and will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to

Affiliates may disclose Confidential Information to their respective
Representatives and Affiliates or use Confidential Information in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements; provided that the Seller and Seller Parent will be responsible for

Agreement, become Representatives of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer)
and (ii) Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may
disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Law or
Order or at the request of a Governmental Body; _provided_ , that, to the
extent permitted by Law, Seller and Seller Parent will, or, if applicable,
will cause their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, promptly notify Buyer to
permit Buyer, at its expense, to seek a protective order or take other
appropriate action. The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ to hold the
Confidential Information in confidence after the Closing will be satisfied if
the Seller, Seller Parent, their Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their
respective Representatives exercise the same care with respect to the
Confidential Information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality
of their own similar information in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. The Seller, Seller Parent
and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not disclose to any
Third Party Proprietary Information related to the Business. The Seller,
Seller Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall protect
and treat the Proprietary Information related to the Business, including any
Proprietary Information or other confidential information related to the
Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, with at least the same care,
and to same extent, as it does its own Proprietary Information of like nature.
Following the Closing, upon the reasonable request of the Buyer, Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to, assign over to
the Buyer the benefit of any nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements with
respect to Proprietary Information, confidential and other information that
relates to the Business to which any Transferred Employee is subject.

more difficult, or to increase the time required, to obtain (1) the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or such
other approval, consent or clearance as may be necessary, proper or advisable
under any foreign Antitrust Law or (2) all other authorizations, consents,
orders, and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(d) Neither Party hereto shall be required to enter into any

any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, (ii) result in any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements being rescinded following the Closing
or (iii) limit or otherwise adversely affect the right of the Buyer (or any

(as applicable).

5.15 _Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation_.

  



  

(a) _Noncompetition_. During the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, none of
Seller Parent nor its Subsidiaries will, nor will such Person direct any of
their respective Affiliates to, anywhere in the world, engage in the
Business, including, without limitation, the production, manufacturing, and/or
marketing of the Products (a " _Competing Activity_ "); _provided_ , that the
foregoing will not prohibit Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, from:

  



  

(i) the acquisition of all or any portion of the assets or equity
interests of any Person engaged in a Competing Activity; _provided_  that if
the Competing Activity accounts for more than twenty five (25%) of the
revenues of such assets or such Person (based on the latest relevant annual
financial statements), Seller Parent will, or, if applicable, will cause its
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) limit such
Competing Activity or (B) divest a portion of the assets that constitute such
Competing Activity, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), within one

required to comply with the revenue thresholds set forth in this _Section

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect
ownership of any voting stock, capital stock or other voting equity
interest of any Person engaged in a Competing Activity, so long as such
ownership interest represents not more than twenty percent (20%) of the
aggregate voting power of such Person;

  



  

(iii) the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect
ownership of any non-convertible debt or non-convertible debt securities of
any Person engaged in a Competing Activity;

  



  

(iv) the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect
ownership of any capital stock or other equity interest, whether voting or
non-voting, of any Person engaged in a Competing Activity which capital stock
or other equity interest is received by Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceeding, _provided_ , that Seller Parent or such Subsidiary disposes of
such capital stock or equity interest following receipt thereof in accordance
with its usual commercial practices with respect thereto;

  



  

(v) owning, engaging in, conducting or operating (A) any of the
Excluded Assets, or (B) any business (other than the Business)
now, previously or hereafter conducted by Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including Other Businesses; or

  



  

(vi) performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

Each investment or acquisition made by Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that is subject to the provisions of this _Section
5.15(a)_ must be permissible hereunder at the time of such investment;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such investment or acquisition of the type
described in the immediately foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) which was
permissible when made cannot thereafter be the basis of a claim of violation
of this _Section 5.15(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined below) of Seller
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, this Agreement shall not limit or prohibit
the controlling Person or group (or its Affiliates) after such Change of
Control transaction from engaging in any of the Competing Activities or any
other activities prohibited pursuant to this _Section 5.15(a)_. " _Change of
Control_ " with respect to a Person means (i) the acquisition at any time by
a Person or "group" (as used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange
Act) who or which are the beneficial owners (as defined in Rule 13(d)-3 under
the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities representing more
than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding equity securities of such
Person or any successor of such Person; (ii) any sale or disposition of
substantially all of the assets of such Person; or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, or statutory share exchange to which such Person is a party as
a result of which the Persons who were stockholders immediately prior to the
effective date of the merger, consolidation or share exchange shall have
beneficial ownership of less than fifty percent (50)% of the surviving
corporation. For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.15(a)_ will survive any change of control and will continue to
apply to Seller Parent notwithstanding such change of control.

(b) _Nonsolicitation_. During the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date:

and acting on its behalf to) hire or employ, or solicit the employment of, or
make or extend any offer of employment to, any Transferred Employee;
_provided_ that the restrictions of this _Section 5.15(b)(i)_ will cease to
apply to any such Person after the three (3)-month anniversary of the date of
termination of his or her employment with Buyer (or Buyer's applicable
Affiliate). Nothing in this _Section 5.15(b)(i)_ will restrict or prevent
Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from making generalized searches for
employees by the use of advertisements in the media of any form (including
trade media) or by engaging search firms provided that they are not

trade media) or by engaging search firms provided that they are not instructed
to solicit the employees described in this _Section 5.15(b)(ii)_ or, in
either case, hiring any employee who responds to such generalized searches or
search firm solicitations. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, the Seller and Seller Parent shall not take any action,
and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to take any action, such that any
Person who would have otherwise been a Business Employee becomes an employee
of or other service provider to the Seller, Seller Parent or any
Affiliate thereof with respect to the Other Businesses.

  



  

5.16 _Wastewater Permit_. As soon as practicable following the date

operated by the Business prior to the Closing and is similar in content to
the wastewater discharged by the Business prior to the Closing.

  



  

5.17 _Further Assurances_. Subject to, and without amendment of,

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, after the Closing

Governmental Authority to perfect its right, title and interest in material
Business Intellectual Property; _provided_ that the Seller shall provide Buyer
with reasonable cooperation and assistance at Buyer's request and expense
(including the execution and delivery of any documentation as may be
reasonably required) in connection with such recording. To the extent any
Transferred Asset is owned or held by any Subsidiary of Seller Parent (other
than the Seller), Seller Parent will cause such transferee Subsidiary to
comply with all obligations of the Seller hereunder in respect of such
Transferred Asset, including by executing the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement or Bill of Sale, as applicable.

8.4 _Procedures_.

  



  

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a
" _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof
to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third-Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
any claim for indemnification hereunder and the basis for indemnification
(including the applicable provision of this Agreement alleged to have been
breached and under which indemnification is being sought), an estimate in
reasonable detail of the Losses incurred in connection therewith and (if
applicable and if known), the method of computation of such amount and such
other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request, to the extent available; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from Liability under this Agreement with respect to such
claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of
rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such claim or (ii) material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such claim.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice
to the Indemnified Party within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third-Party Claim, to assume the
defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, _provided_ _,_  that the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to assume control of such defense if the claim over which the
Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control (i) involves a claim which would
be materially detrimental to or materially injure the Indemnified Party's
reputation, employee, customer, payor or other material business relations,
(ii) primarily seeks non-monetary relief (except if the only non-monetary
relief sought is a declaratory judgment), (iii) involves criminal allegations
against the Indemnified Party, (iv) is one in which the Indemnifying Party is
also a party and joint representation would be inappropriate due to conflicts
of interest or there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party
which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
Party, (v) involves a claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the
appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend, (vi) such claim is by a
Governmental Authority (other than if such claim relates to Taxes or the
Other Businesses) or (vii) it is reasonably likely that damages will be
awarded in excess of the Indemnifying Party's cap on liability for Losses
arising in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof so long
as such participation does not interfere with the Indemnifying
Party's defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
at the expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party and at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent.

  



    

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, no settlement or compromise thereof may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), _provided_ , _however_ , that such consent shall not
be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and
unconditional general release by the Third Party asserting the claim to all
Indemnified Parties affected by the claim without any obligation on the part
of any Indemnified Party (other than an obligation to pay amounts being borne
entirely by the Indemnifying Party) and (ii) the settlement agreement
provides, as the sole relief, monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party and does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the
conduct or operations of any business by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary
herein, in the event that the Indemnifying Party provides prior written
notice to the Indemnified Party of any settlement or compromise of, or offer
to settle or compromise, any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party
withholds its consent to such settlement or compromise then, in the event the
Indemnifying Party is determined to be liable for indemnification hereunder,
in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable for indemnification in
amount greater than the monetary amount contained in such settlement
or compromise of, or offer to settle or compromise, any Third-Party Claim,
plus any reasonable costs of defense as provided herein.

  



  

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against
any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third-Party Claim
being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the
Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation
of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to
provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise
resolving such matters, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party. Such
assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and
copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters,
furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of
such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

8.5 _Environmental Indemnity Matters_. The parties hereto agree on
behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers, managers, employees and other agents and
Representatives that, in addition to the provisions set forth in  _Section
8.4_ ( _provided_ that, in the event of any conflict between this _Section
8.5_ and _Section 8.4_, this _Section 8.5_ will govern), with respect to
any environmental matter (including any matter arising under any
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or involving any Remedial Action)
subject to indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3 _(each an "
_Environmental Indemnity Matter_ " ):

  



  

(a) The Seller and Seller Parent shall have no obligation to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party for any Liability to the extent,
and for the avoidance of doubt any such Liability that arises from the
matters contemplated by this _Section 8.5(a)_ shall be deemed to be an
Assumed Environmental Liability, but in each case only to the extent such
Liability (i) is discovered as a result of any soil or groundwater testing or
sampling conducted by or on behalf of the Buyer, its Affiliates or any other
Buyer Indemnified Party after the Closing Date unless and to the extent (A)
necessary to comply with or required to be performed under Environmental Law
or an Environmental Permit; (B) demanded by a Governmental Authority so long
as none of the Buyer, its Affiliates or any other Buyer Indemnified Party has
taken affirmative steps or actions for the purpose of initiating or
encouraging such demand unless such steps or actions are required under
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit; (C) reasonably necessary to
respond to or correct an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health
or the environment; (D) reasonably necessary for the maintenance,
replacement, improvement (but not expansion) and/or repair of the Transferred
Assets, which maintenance, replacement, improvement (but not expansion)
and/or repair is performed for a bona fide business purpose (which bona fide
business purpose shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, include any purpose
to trigger a remediation of Hazardous Substances except as otherwise
provided under this _Section 8.5(a)_); (E) reasonably required (1) pursuant
to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, the Paper Mill Services
Agreement or the Crossett Sublease, including (x) to develop services to be
provided by the Buyer to the Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to the terms
of the Shared Services Agreement and the Paper Mill Services Agreement or (y)
to replace services to be provided by the Seller and its Affiliates to the
Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement and the Paper
Mill Services Agreement; or (2) to replace services the Seller and its
Affiliates will not provide to the Buyer after the Closing; (F) subject to
_Section 8.4_, reasonably necessary to defend or resolve a Third-
Party Claim; (G) conducted to comply with any lease requirements pertaining
to any Leased Real Property; or (H) reasonably limited to Remedial Action
reasonably necessary to respond to any Release of Hazardous Substances
occurring after the Closing Date; (ii) results from a Release of Hazardous
Substances at the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property by any Person
(other than the Seller or its Affiliates or any personnel, contractor,
employee, agent, tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee of
any of the foregoing) that first begins on or after the Closing Date, or the
exacerbation of any other Release of Hazardous Substances at the Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property, if first caused by any Person (other than
Seller or its Affiliates or any personnel, contractor, employee, agent,
tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee of any of
the foregoing) on or after the Closing Date; (iii) results from activities by
the Buyer or its Affiliates or any personnel, contractor, employee, agent,
tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee of any of the
foregoing on or after the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of
business including any material change of use or any material new use, any
construction, expansion, cessation of business activities, closure,
demolition, or the abandonment of any of the Transferred Assets or the portion
of the Owned Real Property that is the subject of the Crossett Sublease, as
applicable, except to the extent reasonably required pursuant to the terms of
the Shared Services Agreement, the Paper Mill Services Agreement or the
Crossett Sublease; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that any repair,
maintenance, improvement (but not expansion) or replacement of the Transferred
Assets reasonably necessary to operate the Business in the ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as it was operated as of the Closing shall not
violate the foregoing limitation; (iv) except with respect to Environmental
Liabilities as set forth in items (b), (c) (solely to the extent provided in
the proviso to the definition of "Environmental Law") and (d) of
the definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities, results from the coming
into force of, or the change in, any Environmental Law (including any new or
modified cleanup standard or requirement) on or after the Closing Date; (v) is
caused by any failure by any Buyer Indemnified Party to take commercially
reasonable measures to comply in all respects with Environmental Laws and
mitigate any Loss in accordance with _Section 8.9_; (vi) with respect to
Straddle Environmental Liabilities, continues after the Closing during the
Buyer's or its Affiliate's ownership or operation of the Business, the
Transferred Assets or, with respect to the operation of the Business, the
TOFRAC Plant Real Property; or (vii) otherwise has been caused,
exacerbated, compounded or aggravated on or after the Closing Date by the
Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any other Buyer Indemnified Party, or any
employee, agent, contractor, tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or
invitee of any of the foregoing.

(b) Any obligation of the Seller and Seller Parent to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties or of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties for any Environmental Indemnity Matter shall be limited
to, and its obligations under this Agreement shall be satisfied upon
achievement of, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, the minimum standards
required to be met based on industrial use, to attain or maintain compliance
with applicable Environmental Laws as in effect as of the Closing Date. The
parties hereto expressly agree that such minimum standards may include,
without limitation, risk-based clean-up remedies and standards and/or the
imposition of institutional controls, such as deed restrictions and
engineering or institutional controls that are approved by a
Governmental Authority, and further agree to request the application of, and
to implement, risk-based clean-up remedies and standards and/or the
imposition of institutional controls for any remediation required for an
Environmental Indemnity Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such remedies
and standards shall not materially hinder, impair, or limit the continued use
of the property or operation of the Business as a pine chemical business.

  



  

(c) The Seller and Seller Parent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to retain the defense and control of any Environmental
Indemnity Matter arising under _Section 8.2_ , including the management,
disclosure, investigation, negotiation, performance, remediation and
settlement thereof, and all interactions with Governmental Authorities with
regard thereto, and shall (i) keep the Buyer reasonably informed relating to
the progress of such Environmental Indemnity Matter (including, without
limitation, providing the Buyer with copies of all material plans, reports
and external correspondence) and provide reasonable opportunity for the
Buyer to comment to the Seller on any proposed activities, plans, reports and
external correspondence relating to such Environmental Indemnity Matter; (ii)
select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence in connection with such Environmental Indemnity Matter (and the
Seller agrees to incorporate any reasonable comments of the Buyer with respect
to the same); (iii) diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof;
and (iv) not, to the extent practicable, unreasonably interfere with the
Buyer's business operations in connection with such access, and prior to
undertaking any Environmental Indemnity Matter or related investigation,
Seller and Seller Parent shall notify the Buyer of same and give the Buyer the
opportunity to make suggestions to minimize disruption-related impacts or
costs.

  



  

(d) In the event Seller or Seller Parent does not retain the defense
and control of any Environmental Indemnity Matter arising under _Section 8.2_
, and the Buyer provides a defense for the Environmental Indemnity Matter in
accordance with _Section 8.4_, the Buyer shall (i) keep the Seller or Seller
Parent, as applicable, reasonably informed relating to the progress of such
Environmental Indemnity Matter (including, without limitation, providing the
Seller or Seller Parent, as applicable, with copies of all material plans,
reports and external correspondence) and provide reasonable opportunity for
the Seller or Seller Parent, as applicable, to comment to the Buyer on any
proposed activities, plans, reports and external correspondence relating to
such Environmental Indemnity Matter (and the Buyer agrees to incorporate any
reasonable comments of the Seller or Seller Parent, as applicable, with
respect to the same); (ii) select counsel, contractors and consultants of
recognized standing and competence in connection with such Environmental
Indemnity Matter (subject to the approval of the Seller or Seller Parent, as
applicable, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); and (iii) diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto agree to cooperate with and assist any
defense of any Environmental Indemnified Matter, and shall not interfere with
any such defense. The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, provide reasonable access to the Transferred Assets and the
Crossett Facilities (for clarity, including the portion thereof leased by the
Buyer as of and following the Closing), Representatives, utilities, staging
areas and other goods and services that may be necessary or convenient to
manage any such Environmental Indemnity Matter, and to all non-privileged
records and other materials in the possession of the parties hereto, any of
their respective Affiliates, and provide reasonable assistance in the
collection of information or documents, in each case as reasonably required
in connection with an Environmental Indemnity Matter.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a
claim for an Environmental Indemnity Matter may be brought by (i) a Seller
Indemnified Party solely under (A) _Section 8.3(c)_ or (B) _Section
8.3(d)_ in respect of an Assumed Liability identified in _Section 2.3(d)_,
_Section 2.3(i)_ or _Section 2.3(j)_ and (ii) a Buyer Indemnified Party
solely under (A) _Section 8.2(d)_ or (B) _Section 8.2(e)_ in respect of an
Excluded Liability identified in _Section 2.4(d)_ or _Section 2.4(g)_.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.6 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Seller's and Seller Parent's obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be limited as follows:

  



  

(a) no amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ unless and until such Buyer Indemnified Party shall have suffered
indemnifiable Losses in excess of $3,300,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") in the
aggregate, in which case such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover only Losses in excess of the Deductible, _provided_ that the
Deductible shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification
under _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.2(c)_ or _Section
8.2(e)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Seller shall not be obligated to provide indemnification with respect to any
individual claim pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ for Losses if the entire amount
of Losses relating to such claim is less than $25,000 (the " _Per-Claim
Threshold_ "), _provided_ that in the case of any group of claims arising out
of a common or related set of facts, events or circumstances, such claims
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Per-Claim
Threshold has been exceeded. Losses less than the Per-Claim Threshold shall
not be included in the Losses that will be cumulated to determine when the
Deductible is attained;

  



  

(b) in no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to
be paid by the Seller pursuant to (i) _Section 8.2(a)_ exceed $32,000,000
and (ii) _Section 8.2(d)_, together with any claims brought under _Section
8.2(a), _exceed $50,000,000.

  



  

(c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (other than with
respect to _Section 8.2(e)_) the Seller and Seller Parent shall not have any
indemnification obligation under this Agreement for an aggregate amount
greater than the Purchase Price;

  



  

(d) for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims, the
amount of each claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an
amount equal to, and any payments by the Seller pursuant to _Section 8.1_
shall be limited to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting
therefrom (i) any Third Party insurance proceeds (other than proceeds from any
representation and warranty insurance) and (ii) any indemnity, contributions
or other similar payment payable by any Third Party with respect thereto, in
each case, net of any deductible amounts, increases in premiums and costs,
expenses and Taxes paid or incurred with respect to such proceeds, including
any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in procuring such recovery
and only to the extent actually received by a Buyer Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
under _Article VIII_ to the extent a Liability or reserve relating to the
matter giving rise to such Loss has been included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital;

  



  

(f) the Seller and Seller Parent shall not be liable for any Loss
of a Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent that it would not have arisen but
for, or that the Liability to which it relates has been increased by, any
omission carried out on or after the Closing by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party; and

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter
of a claim for indemnification hereunder (but not for purposes of determining
whether there has been a breach), each representation and warranty (other
than _Section 3.7(b)_ and _Section 3.8(b)_) in this Agreement will be read
without regard and without giving effect to the term "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar phrases contained in such representation or
warranty, the inclusion of which would limit or potentially limit a claim by
an Indemnified Party (as if such words were deleted from such representation
and warranty).

  



    

 | 69| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.7 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party receives
any payment from the Seller or Seller Parent in respect of any Losses
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ and the Buyer Indemnified Party could have
recovered all or a part of such Losses from a Third Party (a " _Potential
Contributor_ "), based on the underlying claim asserted against the Seller or
Seller Parent, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall assign, on a non-recourse
basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights
to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Seller or Seller Parent to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount
of such payment. Any payment received in respect of such claim shall be
distributed, (i) first to the Buyer Indemnified Party in the amount of any
deductible or similar amount required to be paid by the Buyer Indemnified
Party prior to the Seller or Seller Parent being required to make any payment
to the Buyer Indemnified Party, (ii) second to the Seller or Seller Parent in
an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by the Seller or Seller Parent
to the Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, plus costs and
expenses incurred in investigating, defending or otherwise incurred in
connection with addressing such claim and (iii) the balance, if any, to the
Buyer Indemnified Party.

  



  

8.8 _Subsequent Recovery_.

  



  

(a) In any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from a
Third Party any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which
the Seller has indemnified it pursuant to this Agreement, such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Seller or Seller Parent, as
applicable, the amount so recovered, but not in excess of the sum of (i) any
amount previously so paid by the Seller or Seller Parent, as applicable, to
or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii)
any amount expended by the Seller in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter; and

  



  

(b) In any case where a Seller Indemnified Party recovers from a
Third Party any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which the Buyer
has indemnified it pursuant to this Agreement, such Seller Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Buyer the amount so recovered net of any costs
of collection or increase in premiums, but not in excess of the sum of (i) any
amount previously so paid by the Buyer to or on behalf of the Seller
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by
the Buyer in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

  



  

8.9 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to
observe its common law duty to mitigate any Loss arising out of or relating to
any matter for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

8.10 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



    

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.11 _Exclusivity_. Except with respect to (a) any claim in which the
Seller or Seller Parent is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have knowingly committed fraud made with the intent to
deceive the Buyer regarding the representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ of this Agreement, or (b) any breach of _Section 5.15_, the
provisions of _Section 2.11_, this _Article VIII_ and _Section 10.13_
hereof set forth the exclusive remedies of the parties to this Agreement for
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to
seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any party
hereto with respect to matters arising under or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

of such condition to be satisfied on or prior to such date; _provided,_
_further_ , that the foregoing proviso shall not prevent the Buyer from being
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ in
the event that it has fulfilled its obligations under _Section 5.9_ until the
time of such termination pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_; or

of breach or alleged breach of _Section 5.9_ or _Section 5.17_ (to the

conditions of _Section 9.2(a)(i)_)).

this _Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by

not enter into this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the Regulatory
Termination Amount, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section
9.2_, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Seller receiving such amount in
the circumstances in which the Regulatory Termination Amount is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The
Regulatory Termination Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Seller and its Affiliates for any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
(x) _Section 9.1(b)_ related to a breach by the Buyer of the covenants in
_Section 5.9(b)_, (y) _Section 9.1(c)_ or (z) _Section 9.1(d)_;

Regulatory Termination Amount when due and owing hereunder or (iii) for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to the rights of the parties hereto to seek
specific performance pursuant to _Section 10.13_ prior to the termination of
this Agreement.

jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not

10.18 _Buyer Parent Guaranty_.

  



  

(a) Buyer Parent unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each
Seller Indemnified Party and their respective successors and assigns the full
and timely performance of the Buyer's obligations required to be performed
prior to, at, or following the Closing pursuant to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including without limitation the obligation to pay the
Closing Purchase Price, the Purchase Price Adjustment (if owed by the Buyer),
the Regulatory Termination Amount (if owed by the Buyer) and any amount owed
by the Buyer under _Section 2.11(d)_, _Section 4.7_, _Section 5.9(f)_,
_Section 6.1_,  _Section 6.3_ and _Article VIII_ (collectively, the "
_Guaranteed Obligations_ "). Buyer Parent acknowledges and agrees that its
guaranty is full, absolute and unconditional, is a guaranty of performance and
not merely of collection and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any
attempt to collect from the Buyer, and no extension, increase, modification,
amendment, waiver, consent, release or extinguishment of any Guaranteed
Obligation, or other change in any Guaranteed Obligation, whether by
agreement of the Buyer and the Seller, decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or
otherwise, will affect the continuing validity and enforceability of its
guaranty, nor will such validity and enforceability be affected by any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Buyer Parent hereby
waives, for the benefit of the Seller, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded
by Law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties,
including those which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the
Seller (other than full performance and payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations), and further waives any notice (including notice of acceptance or
nonpayment), presentment, demand, performance, protest, suit or other action
as the same pertains to the Buyer or any of the applicable
Guaranteed Obligations, or any right to require the Seller to proceed against
the Buyer or to exhaust any security held by the Seller, or to pursue any
other remedy with respect to any of the applicable Guaranteed Obligations.
Buyer Parent may not exercise any rights of subrogation it may acquire due to
its payment of an obligation of the Buyer unless and until the Seller has been
paid in full under this Agreement. In the event that Buyer Parent receives
any payment on account of such rights of subrogation while any portion of the
obligations guaranteed hereby remains outstanding, Buyer Parent shall pay all
such amounts so received to the Seller to be applied to the payment of the
obligations payable hereunder. Buyer Parent agrees that it will indemnify the
Seller and Seller Indemnified Parties for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including legal fees) incurred by the Seller and Seller Indemnified Parties
in connection with the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations.

  



  

(b) Buyer Parent represents and warrants to the Seller that (i) it
is duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the state of its formation or incorporation, (ii)
it has all requisite entity power and authority to (A) execute and deliver
this Agreement, (B) perform its respective obligations hereunder and (C)
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) this Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by it and (iv) assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Seller, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer Parent,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity.

  



  

(c) The obligations of Buyer Parent under its guarantee, with
respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall not be subject to
any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination whatsoever by reason of
the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any Guaranteed Obligation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of Buyer
Parent under its guarantee, with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by, (i)
the failure of the Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy under this _Section 10.18_ or any other agreement, (i) any
default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of all or
any part of any Guaranteed Obligation or (iii) any other act or omission or
delay to do any other act which might in any manner or to any extent vary the
risk of Buyer Parent or which would otherwise operate as a discharge or a
guarantee as a matter of law, and Buyer Parent hereby waives (i) all
presentments, demands for performance or performance of the Buyer, notices of
protest for non-payment or non-performance, notices of default, any other
notice, any proof of reliance by the Seller upon the guarantee contained in
this _Section 10.18_ or acceptance of the guarantee contained herein and all
other formalities, (ii) any rights to set-off recoupments,
claims, counterclaims and (iii) any right to revoke or terminate this
guarantee.

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The Seller and the Buyer may at any time and from time to time
without notice to or consent of Buyer Parent and without impairing
or releasing the obligations of Buyer Parent under its guaranty, with respect
to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, (i) by written agreement make any
change in the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) take or fail to take
any action of any kind in respect of any security for the Guaranteed
Obligations, or (iii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against
the Buyer or others. Buyer Parent shall not institute, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to institute, any Action asserting that this guaranty is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms. This guaranty
may not be revoked or terminated and will remain in full force and effect and
will be binding on Buyer Parent, its successors and assigns until all of its
respective Guaranteed Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full. This
guaranty will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the case may
be, if and to the extent that any payment of, or other transaction satisfying
any Guaranteed Obligation, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the
recipient thereof as a result of the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
similar event of the Buyer, Buyer Parent or any other Person.

  



  

10.19 _Electronic Signature_. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail transmission shall be
as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the Agreement.

  



  

10.20 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the Buyer and the
Seller acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by
counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against
the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

  



  

10.21 _No Conflict; Privilege_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties, for itself and its Affiliates, hereby
confirms that no engagement that King and Spalding LLP has undertaken or may
undertake on behalf of any of the Seller or any of its respective current or
former equity holders or any of their respective Affiliates (the "
_Continuing Clients_ ") will be asserted by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
either as a conflict of interest with respect to, or as a basis to preclude,
challenge or otherwise disqualify King and Spalding LLP from any current or
future representation of any of the Continuing Clients; and (ii) hereby waives
any conflict of interest that exists on or prior to the Closing, or that
might be asserted to exist after the Closing, and any other basis that might
be asserted to preclude, challenge or otherwise disqualify King and Spalding
LLP in any continuing or post-Closing representation of any of the
Continuing Clients.

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications and attorney work-
product documentation between or among any of the Continuing Clients, on the
one hand, and King and Spalding LLP, on the other hand, including that which
was made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery
and performance under, or any dispute or Action arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, or
any matter relating to any of the foregoing (collectively, "
_Protected Material_ "): (i) are privileged and confidential communications
and documentation between or among one or more of the Continuing Clients and
such counsel; (ii) shall be deemed to belong solely to the Continuing Clients;
and will not pass to, be claimed, held or used by or become, following the
Closing, an asset or property of the Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to
disputes between the Buyer, on the one hand and the Seller on the other hand.
From and after the Closing, (A) none of the Buyer, its Affiliates, nor any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Buyer or any of their its
Affiliates, will seek to obtain Protected Material by any process, and (B)
the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, will not assert against
any of the Continuing Clients, or against any manager, director, member,
partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of any of the Continuing Clients, any
attorney-client privilege, or any right to discover or obtain information or
documentation, with respect to disputes relating to this Agreement, any
agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, between King and Spalding LLP, on
the one hand, and either any of the Continuing Clients, on the other hand,
occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any representation from and
after the Closing.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties hereby waives
any attorney-client privilege, including relating to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in connection with any third-
party private or governmental adversarial investigation, proceeding, or
litigation with respect to disputes between the Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Seller on the other hand.

  



  

(i) The Buyer further agrees that King and Spalding LLP is a third
party beneficiary of this _Section 10.21_.
