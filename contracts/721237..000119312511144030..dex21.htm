the holders of any shares of Common Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "
_Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

(a) (i) each share of Common Stock or Series D Preferred Stock held by the
Company as treasury stock or that is issued or outstanding and owned directly
or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be automatically cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor; 

(ii) any shares of Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right to receive the Common
Merger Consideration and shall, at the election of Parent, either (A) convert
into shares of a class of stock of the Surviving Corporation designated by
Parent in connection with the Merger or (B) be cancelled;

(b) each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;

 



-3-  (c) each share of Common Stock (including each share of Restricted Stock) that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $11.75, without interest and
subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable Law (the " _Common
Merger Consideration_ ") and all such shares of Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Common Stock Certificate_ ")
or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any shares of Common Stock shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except, in
all cases, the right to receive (other than with respect to the Cancelled
Shares and the Dissenting Shares) the Common Merger Consideration, without
interest, to be paid in consideration therefore upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.05_; and

(d) each share of Series D Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to $1.88, without interest and subject to any
withholding of taxes required by applicable Law (the " _Series D Merger
Consideration_ ", and together with the Common Merger Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ") and all such shares of Series D Preferred Stock
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented any shares of Series D
Preferred Stock (a " _Preferred Stock Certificate_ " and together with a
Common Stock Certificate, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Series D Preferred Stock, except, in
all cases, the right to receive (other than with respect to the Cancelled
Shares and the Dissenting Shares) the Series D Merger Consideration, without
interest, to be paid in consideration therefore upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with  _Section 2.05_.

Section 2.02 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Common Merger Consideration or the Series D Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section 2.01(c)_ or _Section 2.01(d)_, as
applicable, but instead shall entitle such stockholder to the right to receive
such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares (as defined in  _Section 8.03_) in accordance with the provisions of

due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions

fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such stockholder to receive such consideration
as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such 

 



-4-   Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Common Merger
Consideration or the Series D Merger Consideration, as applicable. The
Company shall (a) serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal
of any shares of Common Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal

proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Without limiting

or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.03 _Restricted Stock; Company Stock Options_.

 

(a) _Restricted Stock_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take, and cause the Board or any committee administering the Stock Option
Plans to adopt resolutions approving the taking of, all actions to provide
that each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the
Stock Option Plans or any applicable restricted stock award agreement
(collectively, " _Restricted Stock_ ") (i) shall automatically vest and become
free of such restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and (iii) shall be automatically converted into the
right to receive the Common Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section
2.01(c)_.

(b) _Stock Options_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall offer to
amend each option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then exercisable or vested, that represents the right to
acquire shares of Common Stock and was issued under, or is otherwise subject
to the terms of, a Company Stock Plan (other than the 2000 Stock Option Plan
and the 2010 Stock Option Plan) (the " _Eligible Options_ "), which amendment
(the " _Option Amendment_ ") will provide that each holder of such Eligible
Options shall be entitled to receive, subject to and effective as of
the Effective Time, the Option Cash Amount for all of such holders Eligible
Options, whether or not then exercisable or vested, in consideration of the
cancellation of all Eligible Options held by such holder (including any
Eligible Options with exercise prices per share equal to or greater than the
Common Merger Consideration), all subject to and effective as of the Effective
Time. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each such holder
of Eligible Options to consent to the Option Amendment. The Company shall
provide Parent with copies of all documents in connection with the Option
Amendment and allow Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and make
reasonable changes to any documents which are proposed to be sent to the
holders of Eligible Options. Additionally, at or prior to the Effective Time
and except as set forth on _Schedule 2.03(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , with respect to each option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, that represents
the right to acquire shares of Common Stock under the 2000 Stock Option Plan
and/or

 



-5-   2010 Stock Option Plan (such options, the " _Cash Out Options_ "), the
Company shall take, and cause the Board or any committee administering the
2000 Stock Option Plan and/or 2010 Stock Option Plan to adopt resolutions
approving the taking of, all actions to provide that each such Cash Out Option
shall as of the Effective Time (A) automatically become fully vested and
exercisable, (B) cease to be outstanding and be automatically cancelled and
cease to exist, and (C) be automatically converted into the right to receive
the Option Cash Amount. For purposes of this _Section 2.03(b)_, "Option Cash
Amount" shall mean (1) as to those Eligible Options or Cash Out Options, as
the case may be, with an exercise price that is equal to or less than the
Common Merger Consideration, the product of (w) the excess, if any, of the
Common Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the
applicable Eligible Option or Cash Out Option, as the case may be, and (x) the
number of shares subject to the applicable Eligible Option or Cash Out Option,
as the case may be, and (2) as to those Eligible Options or Cash Out Options,
as the case may be, with an exercise price that exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the product of (y) $0.10 and (z) the number of shares subject
to the applicable Eligible Option or Cash Out Option, as the case may be; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Option Cash Amount shall be paid net of any
applicable tax withholdings as set forth below, which the Surviving
Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly pay when due to
the appropriate Government Entity for the account of each holder of the
Eligible Option or Cash Out Option, as the case may be.

(ii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay the aggregate Option Cash Amount
payable by the Surviving Corporation with respect to all Eligible Options that
have been modified by an Option Amendment (the " _Option Merger Consideration_
"), and with respect to all Cash Out Options, to the account or accounts
designated by the Company by wire transfer of immediately available United
States funds. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
the second business day thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
holders of Eligible Options that have entered into an Option Amendment, and
Cash Out Options, as the case may be, the cash payments specified in this
_Section 2.03(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on such cash
payments. To the extent the Surviving Corporation or Parent is required to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Eligible Options or Cash Option Options, as
the case may be, or participant in a Company Stock Plan with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any provision of any other tax Law, the amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Eligible Options or Cash Out Options, as the
case may be, or participant in a Company Stock Plan in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.04 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
_ARTICLE II_ to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of
shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), split-up,
combination or exchange or readjustment of shares, (b) a stock dividend or
dividend payable in any other securities of the Company shall be declared
with a record date within such period, or (c) any similar event shall have
occurred, then in each case the Common Merger Consideration, the

 



-6-   Series D Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Common Stock,
Series D Preferred Stock, Eligible Options and Cash Out Options,
respectively, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

 

Section 2.05 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares; Paying Agent_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate, and
enter into an agreement with, a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as paying agent for the Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock as a result of the Merger
upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Parent will
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock that have
been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.01(c)_ and _Section 2.01(d)_, cash sufficient to effect the
payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ and _Section 2.01(d)_ upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. Such Merger Consideration,
once deposited with the Paying Agent, shall, pending its disbursement to such
holders, be held in trust for the benefit of such holders and shall not be
used for any other purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may direct
the Paying Agent to invest such cash in (i) short-term direct obligations of
the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, or (iii) money market funds investing
solely in a combination of the foregoing. Parent shall promptly replace any
funds deposited with Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to
this _Section 2.05(a)_.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but
no later than the second business day thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common Stock
and Series D Preferred Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, held by a holder to the Paying Agent and shall be in such a
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation
may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of
the applicable Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled.
Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as the Paying
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest, in exchange for each share of Common Stock
or Series D Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any
portion of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, is registered, then it shall be a condition
to the payment of 

 



-7-   such Merger Consideration that (A) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall
have (1) paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such payment
in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, surrendered, or (2) established to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that any such taxes either have been paid or
are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.05(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, (other than a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, representing shares of Common
Stock cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the
shares of Common Stock or Series D Preferred Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ or _Section 2.01(d)_, as applicable.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock or Series D Preferred Stock;
Transfer Books_. All consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or

Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock which were

shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, and shall be paid, by the

by the Company of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time
or both) a default under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,

sheet arrangements of any type (including any off-balance sheet arrangement
required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act) that have not been so described in the
Company SEC Documents nor any obligations to enter into any such arrangements.

Subsidiaries, required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act
is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities.

(vi) The Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is reasonably

Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has identified or
been made aware of "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as
defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or
operation of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting which
could reasonably adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, in each case which has not been
subsequently remediated. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances that would prevent the Companys chief executive officer and

required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(ix) The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of

in or waiver of the Companys code of ethics with respect to any such persons,
as required by Section 406(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the Companys
Knowledge, there have been no violations of provisions of the Companys code
of ethics by any such persons.

the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (ii) there has
not been (A) any Material Adverse Change or any event, change or occurrence
that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change, or

methods except insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP, or (C)
any action or event that, had such action or event occurred after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, would be prohibited by
_Sections 4.01(a)(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vii)_ , _(ix)_ , _(xiii)_
, _(xiv)_ and/or _(xvii)_.

(h) _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.01(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, there is no suit, claim, action, legal or administrative
proceeding pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including, without
limitation, any such suit, claim, action, legal or administrative proceeding
that challenges the validity or propriety, or seeks to prevent consummation,
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order,
writ, judgment, decree, injunction, ruling, arbitration award or decree by or
before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against, or, to the
Companys Knowledge, investigation by any Governmental Entity involving, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is not
currently any material internal investigation or inquiry being conducted by
the Company, the Board (or any committee thereof) or, to the Companys
Knowledge, any third party or Governmental Entity at the request of any of
the foregoing concerning any financial, accounting, conflict of interest, self

Section 4.02 _No Solicitation_.

attorneys, accountants and other representatives (collectively, " _Agents_
"), its Subsidiaries and their

 



-39-   respective Agents to immediately cease all discussions and negotiations with
any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and
deliver a written notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company
is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to
any Takeover Proposal and such notice shall also request such Person to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries Agents to (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be likely
to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (which, for the purposes of this subclause
and subclause (ii) shall not include providing information to a member of the
Board in his capacity as a director), (ii) provide any non-public information,
or afford access to the properties, books, records, or personnel of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to any Person that the Company has reason

enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any Person
in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Takeover Proposal or otherwise
in connection with any Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse, recommend, or

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section 4.02(a)_, if,
prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval the Board receives a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal from any Person, which Takeover Proposal did not
result from any breach of this _Section 4.02_ by the Company or its Agents,
then the Company may, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with provisions
relating to confidentiality that are no less favorable to the Company than the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement shall contain provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including _Section 4.02_
hereunder) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), furnish non-
public information to the Person making such Takeover Proposal, provided that
such information either has been provided to Parent or is promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours of furnishing such information) provided to Parent, and,
following the execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, afford
access to the properties, books, records, and personnel of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person in connection with a Takeover Proposal, _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, (i) the Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors and after
taking into consideration any revised offers or proposals submitted by
Parent) that such Takeover Proposal is, or could reasonably be likely to lead
to the delivery of, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its legal advisors) that failure to

 



-40-   take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(d) The Company will notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48
hours) after receipt by the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective Agents) of any Takeover Proposal or any request (other than in the
ordinary course of business and not related to a Takeover Proposal) for non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the properties, books, or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person who the Company knows to be considering making, or
has made, a Takeover Proposal. In such notice, the Company shall identify the
material terms of any such Takeover Proposal or request, including identifying
the party making such Takeover Proposal and include copies of all relevant
documents or communications provided to the Company by such party that relate
to the terms of the Takeover Proposal or request. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status of any such Takeover
Proposal or request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and
any modifications thereto). The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48
hours prior notice of any meeting of the Board at which the Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication
of interest from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or
"group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to,
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) sale,
lease, exchange, transfer, license (other than licenses in the ordinary
course of business), acquisition or disposition of assets of the Company or
its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or
to which 20% or more of the Companys net revenues or net income on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 20% or more (or, in
the case of any person beneficially owning (for purposes of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of
the date of this Agreement, any additional shares of any class of outstanding
voting or equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 20% or more (or, in the case of any person beneficially
owning (for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) 20% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement, any
additional shares) of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend or other significant corporate
reorganization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the business of
which constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (E) any combination of the
foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated
assets, net revenues or net income and Company Common Stock involved is 20% or
more; in each case, other than the Transaction;

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written, bona fide proposal or offer, or
series of related proposals or offers, made by any Person or "group" (as such
term is defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) to consummate an
Acquisition Transaction, which, in the good faith determination of the Board,
taking into consideration the various legal,

 



-41-   financial, and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Transaction and the
Person or group making the proposal or proposals for such Acquisition
Transaction (including any required financing, stockholder approval
requirements of the Person or group making the proposal, regulatory approvals,
stockholder litigation, breakup fee and expense reimbursement provisions,
expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation, and, to the
extent deemed appropriate by the Board, such other factors that may be
considered in making such a determination under the DGCL) (A) if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of the Company than the Transaction; and

(iii) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, sale or
disposition or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which a Person (or its stockholders) would own, if
consummated, all or substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Company (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect
parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(f) Except as permitted by this  _Section 4.02(f)_, neither the Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to make, amend, change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to amend, change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend to the stockholders
of the Company any Takeover Proposal, Acquisition Transaction or Superior
Proposal, (ii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender or exchange
offer for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) business days after
commencement of such offer, (iii) make any public statement inconsistent with
the Company Recommendation (actions described in clauses (i)-(iii) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (iv) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Agents to enter into any Acquisition Agreement, (v) take any action
pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ or (vi) resolve to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Board may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in order to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction
in connection with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(d)(ii)_ if the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (x) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (y) that such Acquisition Transaction constitutes a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking such
action (1) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) calendar days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
include a copy of the Superior Proposal, a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Agents to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement and any other agreements relating to the Transaction
such that it would cause such Acquisition Transaction to no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice period, the Board
shall have considered in good faith any proposed

 



-42-   revisions to this Agreement and any other agreements relating to the
transaction contemplated hereby proposed in writing by Parent in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have
determined that the Acquisition Transaction would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect and (4) in the
event of any material change to the material terms of such Acquisition
Transaction, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above and the
notice period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be
at least three (3) calendar days (rather than the four (4) calendar days
contemplated by clause (i) above); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this  _Section 4.02_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, any purported termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.02(f)_ shall be void and of no
force and effect, unless the Company termination is in accordance with
_Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ and the Company pays Parent the applicable Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 7.02_ prior to or concurrently with such
termination. 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.02_ shall prohibit the Company from
(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that any
disclosures permitted under this _Section 4.02(g)_ that does not contain
either an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of
the Company) in which the Company indicates that it has not changed the
Company Recommendation.

generality of the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as
the case may be, shall promptly furnish to the other in writing the
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will
not on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the
time of the Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the

cleared by the SEC and its staff for mailing to the stockholders of the
Company, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the Stockholders Meeting (the "
_Stockholder Approval_ ") to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone
or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting only (i) with the consent of Parent or
(ii) for the absence of a quorum.

(d) Unless the Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with _Section 4.02(f)_, the Board shall make the Company
Recommendation, include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement 

 



-44-   and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval, and
the Company shall otherwise comply with all Laws applicable to the
Stockholders Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_,
the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Stockholders Meeting and the matters constituting the
Stockholder Approval shall be submitted to the holders of Common Stock at the
Stockholders Meeting whether or not (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall have occurred or (B) any Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal
shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to the
Company or any of its Agents. Unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.01_, the Company agrees that it shall not
submit to the vote of the stockholders of the Company any Takeover Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the holders of
Common Stock with respect to the Merger at the Stockholders Meeting. The
notice of such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to approve
and adopt this Agreement and the Merger will be considered at the Stockholder
Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or voted upon at the
Stockholder Meeting without Parents prior written consent.

Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to restrictions under applicable Law, the Company shall afford to
Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors, Debt Financing Sources and their respective Agents, reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the
Company during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement, to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books,
Contracts, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall
furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, (ii) a copy
of each correspondence or written communication with any United States Federal
or state governmental agency, and (iii) all other information concerning its
and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that that the Company may
restrict the foregoing access to such information or personnel to the extent
that such disclosure would based on the advice of legal counsel result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege applicable to such information. 

(b) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated December 6, 2008 as amended by the letter
agreement dated July 7, 2010, between the Company and Parents Affiliate (as
amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), Parent shall
hold, and shall cause Merger Sub and its and Merger Subs respective
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Agents
to hold, all information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ or information provided
or received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of
the representations or warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of the parties
hereto.

 



-45-  Section 5.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and

proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its respective reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause

under any Material Contract or Company Lease or otherwise to the extent
related to the Merger; provided that none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub

anything of value to obtain such consents. The parties agree that obtaining
the Education and Childcare Approvals shall be the responsibility of the
Company and shall be a condition precedent to Parents obligation to effect
the Closing. Parent shall cooperate with all reasonable requests from the
Company for information in connection with obtaining such Education and
Childcare Approvals and consistent with the general obligations in this
_Section 5.02_, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use its

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all obligations of the

their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ "),
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust
Division_ ") or any other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or
such transactions, and (C) cooperate with each other in connection with any
such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or

 



-46-   other Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. Each such party shall furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall promptly inform the
other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of
written communications with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with a Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable
Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analysis, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws.

efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "
_Antitrust Laws_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the
execution of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with the
receipt of any necessary governmental approvals or clearances (including under
any Antitrust Law), nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or Merger
Sub, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of Parent agree or proffer to, divest, hold separate, or enter
into any license or similar agreement with respect to, or agree to restrict
the ownership or operation of, or agree to conduct or operate in a specified
manner, any portion of the business or assets of Parent, any Affiliate of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of
any suit, claim, action, litigation, arbitration, proceeding (including any
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or appellate proceeding),
hearing, audit, examination or investigation commenced, brought, conducted or
heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any court or other Governmental
Entity or any arbitrator or arbitration panel (a " _Proceeding_ "), whether
judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity or appeal any
order issued, granted or entered by any Governmental Entity (i) challenging or
seeking to make illegal, delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries any damages in connection therewith, or (ii) seeking to prohibit
or limit in any respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or
operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates of all
or any portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of 

 



-47-   its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or to require any such Person to dispose of,
license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or enter
into a consent decree or hold separate all or any portion of the business,
assets or any product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case as a result of or in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
(i) shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
Proceeding against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) will obtain the
prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such
Proceeding, unless the effects of any such settlement or satisfaction do not
include any of the effects described in this _Section 5.03(c)_.

Section 5.04 _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and
Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective
Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (1) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (2) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee
in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or taken at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, trustee
or fiduciary of another Person (including any Company Benefit Plan), in each
case under (1) or (2), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in
whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (1) the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the organizational documents of
its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and (2) any
indemnification agreement between any such Indemnitee and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as currently in effect, to the extent such agreement is
set forth in _Section 5.04 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, which
agreements shall survive the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 5.04_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this _Section 5.04_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of, and all
limitations

 



-48-   on the personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for in this
_Section 5.04_ or in the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or other applicable organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof (including through
any indemnification agreement) shall not be modified, and shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on personal liability
in respect of any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation asserted
or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation.

(b) The Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume and control the defense of any threatened or actual
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating to any acts or
omissions covered under this _Section 5.04_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") unless
there is a conflict of interest between Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
on the one hand, and the Indemnitee, on the other;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Claim for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder without the prior
written consent of such Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability
arising out of such Claim; and _provided further_ that the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable,
that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnitee in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any Indemnitee wishing to
claim indemnification under this  _Section 5.04_, upon learning of any such
threatened or actual Claim, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent thereof; _provided_ that
the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent except to the extent, if any, such failure to
promptly notify materially prejudices such party. Each of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in the defense of
any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and
any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to
such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage required above with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not
be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent
such premiums exceed 200% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
the Company for such insurance (such 200% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); and
_provided further_ that, if the

 



-49-   aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed the Base Premium,
then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual
premium equal to the Base Premium. Prior to the Effective Time Parent or the
Company may purchase, for an aggregate amount that shall not exceed the Base
Premium, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing
at least materially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by Parent or the
Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations of the Parent to
obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 5.04_. The Surviving Corporation
shall not amend, modify, cancel or revoke such policy and each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations
thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.04_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 5.04_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this _Section 5.04_ applies unless (A) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law, or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.04_ applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.04_).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 5.04_.

Section 5.05 _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent
shall pay all of the filing fees and expenses for Parents pre-merger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall pay all of the fees and expenses in connection with
preparation of the Companys pre-merger notification and report forms under
the HSR Act, if any.

 

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) a party
may, without the prior written consent of the other party, issue such press
release or make such public

 



-50-   statement as may be required by Law or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press release or making
such public statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do
so in a timely manner, and (b) the Company may, without the prior written
consent of Parent, and in compliance with any applicable notification
provisions in _Section 4.02_, issue such press release or make such public
statement release or announcement with respect to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change effected in accordance with  _Section 4.02(f)_. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

 

Section 5.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or, in the case of the Company, a Company Subsidiary,
and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which relate to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty or breach of covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section
6.02_ not to be satisfied.

Section 5.08 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of not less than six (6) months following the Effective
Time, the employees of the Company who remain in the employment of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
the employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
excluding stock-based compensation and severance/retention-
related compensation or benefits).

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent
for purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit accruals in any benefit plan,
program or policy covering that Continuing Employee following the Effective
Time, but not for the purposes of benefit accruals that would result in
duplication of benefits.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person; _provided_ , _however_ , that Surviving
Corporation will, and Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to, comply
with terms and conditions of all employment, severance and other compensatory
agreements or arrangements with any directors or employees of the

 



-51-   Company that are in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are listed in
_Section 5.08(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.08_ will create any third-party beneficiary
right for the benefit of any Person other than the parties to this Agreement,
or any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Nothing in this  _Section 5.08_ or
any other provision of this Agreement (i) will be construed to establish,
amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) will limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any
of the Company Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

Section 5.09 _Financing_ _._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Companys
compliance with its obligations contained in this Agreement, Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters
and any Fee Letter and not to permit any amendment or modification to be made
to, or any waiver of any material provisions under, the Commitment Letters or
any Fee Letter, if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing, (B) imposes additional conditions precedent
to the initial availability of the Debt Financing or amends or modifies any
of the existing conditions to the provision of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to delay, prevent or render materially less
likely to occur the Debt Financing, or any portion thereof, on the Closing
Date, or (C) adversely impacts the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto; (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, or, to the
extent the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is not
available to Parent, on other terms not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions set forth
in such Debt Commitment Letter applicable to Parent and Merger Sub that are
within their control; (iv) subject to the satisfaction of the condition
contained in _Section 6.02(d)_ and subject to _Section 5.09(e)_, fully
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters; and (v) comply in all
material respects with its covenants and other obligations under the
Commitment Letters.

 



-52-  (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Companys
compliance with its obligations contained in this Agreement and subject to
the satisfaction of the condition contained in _Section 6.02(d)_, if any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing from alternative
sources (such sources, together with the lenders set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") in an amount, when taken
together with the amount of the Financing that is then available, sufficient
to consummate the Transaction on terms not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event (such alternative debt financing, the " _Alternative Debt
Financing_ "). Parent will give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach by any party to the Financing Letters, of which Parent becomes aware,
or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and the Company shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) provide, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Agents (and its Subsidiaries Agents),
including legal and accounting Agents, to provide, in each case, at
Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub and that is necessary in connection with arranging and obtaining
the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or Alternative
Debt Financing (collectively with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_
"), including without limitation (i) assisting Parent with the preparation of
information memoranda and packages, lender presentations and similar documents
and materials, in connection with the Available Financing, (ii) participating
in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions
(including bring down diligence sessions) in connection with the Available
Financing, including direct contact between senior management and Agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and the Debt Financing Sources in the
Available Financing, (iii) (A) within twenty-five (25) days after the end of
each fiscal month that ends after the date hereof, deliver to Parent
consolidated unaudited monthly financial statements (balance sheet, income
statement and statement of cash flows), and (B) as soon as reasonably
practical after Parents request therefor but in no event later than thirty
(30) days from the date of such request, (x) provide to Parent true and
complete copies of consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as reasonably requested by Parent (collectively, the financial
statements referred to in clause (A) and (B) above, the " _Required Financial
Information_ "), and (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Companys independent auditors to provide consent to the use of any audited
financial statements contained in the Required Financial Information in the
offering documents (iv) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive financing documents, including collateral documents,
hedging agreements and other certificates and documents as may be requested by
Parent or Merger Sub (including a certificate of the chief financial officer
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters), (v)
facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Available Financing, including
taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the Debt Financing
Sources in the Available Financing to evaluate the Companys and
its Subsidiaries real property and current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and
other accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements in
connection with the Available Financing, (vi) using commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consents, waivers, estoppels, approvals, authorizations
and instruments which may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in

 



-53-   connection with the Available Financing and collateral arrangements,
including customary payoff letters, lien releases, instruments of termination
or discharge, legal opinions, appraisals, engineering reports, surveys, title
insurance, landlord consents, waivers and access agreements and (vii)
facilitating the consummation of the Available Financing, including
cooperating with Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions precedent to
the Available Financing to the extent within the control of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub
to permit the consummation of the Available Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation immediately
upon the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, no obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Agents
under any such agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be
effective until the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment
fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent or to incur any liability with
respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Required Financial
Information required to be delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.09(c)_ shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, for the absence of footnotes and normal, recurring year-
end adjustments).

(d) Parent and Merger Sub will take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do
(or cause to be done) all things necessary or advisable to obtain the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and to fully enforce
the Equity Commitment Letter.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.09_ shall require, and in no event shall
the efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either
Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action against any source of
the Financing to enforce its respective rights under the Financing Letters or
any Fee Letter, except that Parent shall seek enforcement of the Equity
Commitment Letter solely if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of
specific performance to consummate the Merger after all conditions to the
granting therefor set forth in _Section 8.12_ of this Agreement have been
satisfied, including, without limitation, that the Debt Financing Sources have
indicated in writing that they are prepared to fund the Debt Financing if and
when the Equity Provider funds the Equity Financing, (ii) seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or
(iii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Letters
(whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

Section 5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover applicable Law becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger, the
Voting Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
anti-takeover applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

 



-54-  Section 5.11 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, other than
with respect to any directors identified by Parent in writing to the Company
two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent resignations executed by each director of
the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which
resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Interpretative
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities with respect to equity securities of the Company) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of
the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect
to equity securities of the Company.

five years been, a "United States real property holding corporation" (within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code). 

 



-56-  Section 6.03 _Conditions to Obligations of the Company_. The obligation of

warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true

Parent by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub._ Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to
be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and
the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an

or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
6.01_, _Section 6.02_, or _Section 6.03_, as the case may be, to be

such suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination Fee at the prime

determines in a final, non-appealable judgment that the Company is not
entitled to the Parent Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then the
Company shall pay the Parent and Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit.

 

(h) The parties acknowledge that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the applicable Parent Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

Section 7.03 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 7.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void

 



-60-   and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of

employees, partners, members or stockholders;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the agreements contained in _Section 5.02(b)_, _Section 5.05_, _Section
7.02_, _Section 7.03_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ shall survive the termination of
this Agreement, and (ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be
relieved from liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree
shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and
that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit either party from seeking to
prove that such damages include the benefit of the bargain lost by such party
or such partys stockholders) arising out of the willful and material breach
by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, subject to _Sections 7.03(b)_ and
_8.12(c)_ ; provided, further, that the failure of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger after all conditions in _Section 6.01_ and _Section
6.02_ have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied upon Closing), shall
be deemed a willful and material breach by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement.

(b) The parties agree that (i) the payment of the Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect
to this Agreement and the Transaction in the event any payment of the
Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms of this Agreement,
and, upon payment of the Termination Fee the Company shall have no further
liability to Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, and (ii) the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the
Company with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction in the event any
payment of the Parent Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms
of this Agreement, and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any further liability to the Company. The
parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee in the circumstances in
which the Termination Fee becomes payable, constitutes liquidated damages and
is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable amount that will compensate
the Parent and Merger Sub for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties further agree that the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee
becomes payable, constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty, but
rather a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties agree that
for the purpose of this Agreement the Parent Termination fee shall not be due
and payable under the terms of this Agreement until the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iii)_.

with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
It is accordingly agreed that prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.01_ (i) the parties shall be
entitled to seek (in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in
_Section 8.12(d)_) an

 



-67-   injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than
Parents and/or Merger Subs obligations to effect the Closing), without bond
or other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 7.02_ and/or _Section 7.03_,
but subject in all cases to  _Section 8.12(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ below and
(ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions
and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent nor Merger Sub would
have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly further agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable remedy to specifically enforce the Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth
herein (as opposed to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedy to force Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their other obligations
set forth herein (other than Parents and/or Merger Subs obligations to
effect the Closing), which shall be governed by the preceding sentence) _only_
in the event that (A) all conditions in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is then capable of
being satisfied at a Closing on such date) at the time when the Closing would
have occurred but for the failure of the Parent to comply with its
obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (B)
the Debt Financing (or, if applicable, the Alternative Debt Financing) has
been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Parent complies with its
obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and
(C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or, if applicable, the
Alternative Debt Financing) are funded, then the Closing will occur.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that
the payment of the Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as provided in
_Sections 7.02_ and _7.03(b),_ constitutes the sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement and with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for the party to whom payment thereof has become due and payable.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that in all
other circumstances, the parties only remedies under this Agreement and with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be (i) prior
to a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.01_,
the equitable remedies to the extent provided in  _Section 8.12(a)_, and
(ii) following a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.01_, the right to seek monetary damages for a willful and material
breach of this Agreement to the extent provided in _Section 7.03(a)_ and
subject to the limitations provided in _Section 8.12(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any party be entitled to receive both of
the remedies set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) (but such party
may seek the remedies set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) until
one of them is awarded).

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for damages or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be limited to $78,539,304
(the " _Parent Liability Cap_ "). In no event shall the Company seek or permit
to be sought on behalf of the Company any damages or any other recovery,
judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, from any officer, director, agent or employee of Parent or
Merger Sub, any direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or
securities of Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or

 



-68-   indirect director, officer, employee, partner, Affiliate, member,
controlling Person or representative of any of the foregoing, in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that its has no right of recovery against, and no
personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to damages, any
Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub to the extent provided in
this Agreement or the Equity Provider to the extent provided in the Equity
Commitment Letter), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim
by or on behalf of the Company against Parent or any Affiliate thereof, by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise. The Company
acknowledges that both Parent and Merger Sub are newly-formed companies and
do not have any material assets except in connection with this Agreement or as
provided by the Equity Commitment Letter. The provisions of this _Section
8.12_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties expressly referred to above.

(d) Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
or of any state court located in the State of Delaware situated in New Castle
county, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware or a state court located in the State of Delaware situated in New
Castle county.

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (a) no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of any
action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event
of a legal action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this
waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has
been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual
waiver and certifications in this _Section 8.13_.

Section 8.14  _Severability_. If any term, condition or other provision of
this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term, condition or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.
