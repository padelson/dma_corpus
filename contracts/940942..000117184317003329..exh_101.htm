provided that such consent shall not be a condition to Closing and if any of
the lenders under the Equipment Note Debt do not consent to the assumption
of all or a portion of the Equipment Note Debt by the Company (such portion
of the Equipment Note Debt that is not assumed by the Company hereunder is
referred to herein as the " _Unassumed Equipment Note Debt_ " and that portion
of the Equipment Note Debt that is assumed by the Company hereunder is
referred to herein as the " _Assumed Equipment Note Debt_ "), the Closing
shall not be delayed or terminated on account thereof and Purchaser shall pay
off such Unassumed Equipment Note Debt at Closing in the same manner as
Purchaser is required to pay the holders of other Indebtedness under _Section
2.4(a)_ of this Agreement in accordance with the payoff letters delivered by
Seller to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.2(s)_.

  



  

2.5   _Earnout_.

  



  

(a)  Purchaser shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount not to
exceed the Maximum Aggregate Earnout Payments on the following terms and
conditions:

  



  

(i)  for each of (A) the period constituting the first twelve full months
following the Closing Date (the " _First Earnout Period_ "), and (B) the
period beginning the day after the end of the First Earnout Period and ending
on the twelve month anniversary thereof (the " _Second Earnout Period_ " and
together with the First Earnout Period, each, an " _Earnout Period_ "),
Purchaser shall make a cash payment (each, an " _Earnout Payment_ ") to Seller
based on the Business EBITDA for that Earnout Period;

  



  

(ii)  for each Earnout Period, (A) if the Business EBITDA for that Earnout
Period is equal to or exceeds the Target Business EBITDA for such Earnout
Period, the Earnout Payment shall be an amount equal to the Maximum Annual
Earnout Payment for such Earnout Period, (B) if the Business EBITDA for that
Earnout Period is greater than the Minimum Target Business EBITDA for that
Earnout Period but less than the Target Business EBITDA for that Earnout
Period, the Earnout Payment shall be an amount equal to (I) the Maximum
Annual Earnout Payment for that Earnout Period _multiplied by_ (II) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Business EBITDA for that Earnout
Period in excess of the Minimum Target Business EBITDA for that Earnout Period
and the denominator of which is the aggregate difference between the Target
Business EBITDA for that Earnout Period and the Minimum Target Business EBITDA
for that Earnout Period or (C) if the Business EBITDA for that Earnout Period
is equal to or less than the Minimum Target Business EBITDA for that Earnout
Period, the Earnout Payment shall equal zero (in the event that the Business
EBITDA for an Earnout Period is less than the Target Business EBITDA for that
Earnout Period, it is referred to herein as a " _Business EBITDA Shortfall_
");

  



   

19

 



    

  

(iii) if in either Earnout Period, the Business EBITDA for such Earnout
Period exceeds the Target Business EBITDA for the Earnout Period, such excess
(" _Excess Business EBITDA_ ") may be applied to the previous or subsequent
Earnout Period in which there was a Business EBITDA Shortfall in the
following manner:

  



  

(A)  if the Excess Business EBITDA is applied to the previous
Earnout Period and if the sum of the Business EBITDA for that
previous Earnout Period plus the Excess Business EBITDA would have resulted
in an Earnout Payment greater than the Earnout Payment actually earned in the
previous Earnout Period as calculated under _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_ , Purchaser
shall make a "catch-up" payment (a " _Catch-Up Payment_ ") to Seller in an
amount equal to (x) the Earnout Payment that Seller would have earned in the
previous Earnout Period if the Excess Business EBITDA had applied to such
Earnout Period _less_ (y) the Earnout Payment actually earned in the previous
Earnout Period; and

  



  

(B)  if the Excess Business EBITDA is applied to the future
Earnout Period in which a Business EBITDA Shortfall exists, such excess shall
be added to the Business EBITDA for the later Earnout Period to determine the
amount of the Earnout Payment, if any, payable under _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_ ;

  



  

(iv) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Purchaser be obligated to pay to Seller aggregate Earnout
Payments (including any Catch-Up Payment) in excess of the Maximum Aggregate
Earnout Payments; and

  



  

(v)  the Earnout Payments and Catch-Up Payment, if any, are subject to set-
off in accordance with _Sections 2.5(f)_ and  _12.6_.

  



  

(b)  Within ninety (90) days after the end of each Earnout
Period, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a statement, including work papers
and schedules supporting such statement certified by Purchaser's Chief
Financial Officer (each an " _Earnout Statement_ "), setting forth
Purchaser's calculation of (i) the Business EBITDA for that Earnout Period;
and (ii) the Earnout Payment (and any Catch-Up Payment) for that Earnout
Period based thereon.

  



  

(c)  Within thirty (30) days after an Earnout Statement is
delivered to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ , Seller shall complete its
examination thereof and shall deliver to Purchaser either (i) a written
acknowledgement accepting such Earnout Statement; or (ii) a written report
setting forth in reasonable detail any proposed adjustments to the such
Earnout Statement (each an " _Earnout Adjustment Report_ "). If Seller fails
to respond to Purchaser within such thirty (30) day period, Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to such Earnout Statement (and the
calculations thereon) as delivered pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_. During such
thirty (30) day period, Purchaser shall provide to Seller reasonable access to
the appropriate personnel, accountants, financial books and records of
Purchaser and the Company, as well as any additional relevant information and
work papers as it may reasonably request, to enable it to properly evaluate
each Earnout Statement.

  



   

20

 



    

  

(d)  In the event Seller and Purchaser fail to agree on any of
Seller's proposed adjustments contained in an Earnout Adjustment Report
within thirty (30) days after Purchaser receives such Earnout Adjustment
Report, then Seller and Purchaser agree that the Independent Auditors shall
make the final determination with respect to the correctness of the proposed
adjustments in such Earnout Adjustment Report in light of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditors to resolve
all disagreements as soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty
(60) days after submission of the dispute to the Independent Auditors. The
decision of the Independent Auditors shall be final and binding on Seller and
Purchaser. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditors incurred in
connection with the determination of the disputed items by the Independent
Auditors shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party, as determined by the Independent Auditors.

  



  

(e)  All payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.5_
with respect to any Earnout Period shall be by the wire transfer of
immediately available funds within fifteen (15) Business Days following the
final determination of the Earnout Payment (and any Catch-Up Payment) for
such Earnout Period to an account designated by Seller to Purchaser in writing
in advance of the payment thereof; _provided_ that (i) with respect to the
Earnout Payment, if any, for the First Earnout Period, said Earnout
Payment shall not be paid until determination of the Insurance Deficiency, if
any, pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_ for the Seller policy years 2015/2016 and
2016/2017, and (ii) respect to the Earnout Payment, if any, for the Second
Earnout Period, said Earnout Payment (including any Catch-Up Payment) shall
be subject to set off by the amount, if any, by which the Deficiency Offset
Amount, if any, exceeds the amount determined to be the Earnout Payment for
the First Earnout Period

  



  

(f)  Seller and Purchaser agree that Purchaser shall have the
right to set off against any Earnout Payment (including the Catch-Up Payment)
the Deficiency Offset Amount. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser on
or about August 1, 2018 a written report (together with all supporting
documentation) setting forth a calculation for the 2015/2016 policy year of
the Business (but excluding claims prior to January 1, 2016) and the
2016/2017 policy year of the Business (but excluding claims after December 31,
2016) of any Deficiency Offset Amount. The " _Deficiency Offset Amount_ "
shall be (i) zero if the Insurance Deficiency is less than zero, or (ii) if
the Insurance Deficiency is greater than zero, the product of 6.75 _multiplied
by_ the Insurance Deficiency, but (iii) in no event greater than $5,400,000.
Truline losses shall be excluded from the determination. Any dispute as to
the determination of an Insurance Deficiency shall be submitted to the
Independent Auditor to be resolved as provided in  _Section 2.5(d)_.

  



  

(g)  Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller's right
to receive the Earnout Payments pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ is solely an
unsecured contractual right and is not a security for purposes of any federal
or state securities Laws, (ii) will not be represented by any form of
certificate or instrument, (iii) does not give Seller any distribution rights,
voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights, anti-dilution rights or
other rights common to holders of equity securities, (iv) is not redeemable
and (v) may not be sold, assigned, pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated, gifted,
conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed of, except by operation of law
(and any such action in violation of this _Section 2.5(g)_ shall be null and
void _ab initio_ ). In connection with the payment to Seller of the Earnout
Payments, if any, Seller will execute and deliver to Purchaser a
customary payoff letter and upon receipt by Seller of an Earnout Payment, a
release of claims solely with respect to the calculation of such Earnout
Payment, in favor of Purchaser and its Affiliates.

  



   

21

 



    

  

(h)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall impose no restrictions on, or require Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates to take any action with respect to, the operations, business
or activities of Purchaser or the Company after the Closing. The
Equityholders and Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) the Company, Purchaser
and its Affiliates may make from time to time such business decisions and
take such actions as they deem appropriate in respect of the conduct of the
business of the Company following the Closing, including decisions or actions
that may have an impact on the Business EBITDA and Seller and the
Equityholders shall have no right to claim any lost Earnout Payment or other
Adverse Consequences as a result of such decisions or actions so long as the
decisions or actions were not taken by the Company, Purchaser or its
Affiliates in bad faith a significant purpose of which is to frustrate the
provisions of this _Section 2.5_ or to reduce the amount or likelihood of
payment of any Earnout Payments and (ii) Purchaser shall have no duty or
obligation to make any capital contribution to the Company. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Equityholders and Seller further
acknowledge and agree that at such time following the Closing as may be
reasonably determined by Purchaser, provided that Purchaser maintains the
ability to separately track Business EBITDA for purposes of this _Section
2.5_ , (A) all financial statements, billing matters, payment of accounts
payable, collections of accounts receivable, bank accounts, credit facilities
and other financial operations or activities of the Company may be
consolidated with other operations of Purchaser and its Affiliates; (B) the
Company's business may transition to using Purchaser's operational and
financial technology, and (C) Purchaser may dissolve or terminate the Company
and operate the Company's business as a division of Purchaser or an Affiliate
of Purchaser, in each case, provided that such actions are not taken by the
Company, Purchaser or its Affiliates in bad faith a significant purpose of
which is to frustrate the provisions of this _Section 2.5_  or to reduce the
amount or likelihood of payment of any Earnout Payments.

  



  

(i)  Seller's right to receive the Earnout Payments shall be
terminated in the event of the breach in any material respect by any
Restricted Party of its or his obligations under _Section 15.5_ or _15.6_ ,
which breach is not cured by such breaching party within ten (10) days
following delivery by Purchaser to such breaching party of written notice
informing such breaching party of such breach.

  



  

(j)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Earnout Payments (and any Catch-Up Payment) shall be reduced by an aggregate
amount equal to the sum of (i) any and all amounts payable by the Company
under the Employee Incentive Agreements (before reduction for withholding
Taxes) and (ii) all employer Taxes with respect to the amounts payable under
the Employee Incentive Agreements.

the date hereof, each of Seller and the Company shall (i) promptly file, or
cause to be promptly filed, with any Governmental Authorities all such
notices, applications or other documents set forth on _Schedule 4.1(b)_ as
are necessary for Seller to contribute, assign, convey, transfer and deliver
to the Company all Permits held by Seller that are necessary for the Company
to operate the Business in substantially the same manner as operated by
Seller on the date hereof and prior to the Closing in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and (ii) thereafter diligently pursue

shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate amount of all
filing fees under the HSR Act and any required filings under any other
antitrust or competition laws of any applicable jurisdiction, but both shall
be responsible for their respective legal fees regarding such filings. The
parties further agree to comply at the earliest practicable date with any
formal or informal request for additional information or documentation
received from the FTC, DOJ or any foreign competition authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party further
agrees to cooperate with the other parties in order to resolve any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby initiated by the FTC, DOJ or any foreign competition authority. The
parties agree to promptly inform the other party of any material communication
made to or received from the FTC, DOJ or any foreign competition authority.
The parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to offer
to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
taking all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority may
assert under the HSR Act or any other Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as expeditiously possible; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall control any
response with respect to any such investigation or other inquiry; and
_provided further_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.1(c)_ shall require or be
construed to require (i) Purchaser, the Company or their Affiliates to
propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition
of any Purchased Assets or any assets or businesses of the Business or
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates, or (ii) Purchaser, the
Company or their Affiliates to take or commit to take actions that after the
Closing Date would limit the freedom of Purchaser, the Company or their
Affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their
respective businesses or assets (including the Business and the
Purchased Assets), in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
Closing.

by the Company at or prior to the Closing;

  



  

(d)  any Retained Liabilities;

  



  

(e)  any Retained Assets; or

  



  

(f)  the following Taxes: (i) Seller's allocable share of any
Transfer Taxes (and related out-of-pocket expenses), in each case, as
determined pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ; and (ii) any Retained Taxes.

  



  

12.2   _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Article XII_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser covenants and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Equityholders, and, as applicable,
their respective officers, directors, managers, equityholders, employees,
agents and heirs (together, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any and all Adverse Consequences incurred or suffered by the Seller
Indemnitees to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

  



  

(a)  any inaccuracy in or breach of, or, with respect to a
third-party claim, any alleged breach or inaccuracy of, any representation or
warranty of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or in any document or
certificate delivered by Purchaser in connection with this Agreement;

  



   

55

 



    

  

(b)  any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set
forth herein or in any document or certificate delivered by Purchaser in
connection with this Agreement;

  



  

(c)  any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth herein or in any document or certificate delivered by the Company in
connection with this Agreement, in each case, to be performed or complied with
by the Company after the Closing;

  



  

(d)  any Assumed Liability;

  



  

(e)  Purchaser's allocable share of any Transfer Taxes (as
determined pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ); or

  



  

(f)  the Guarantees (but solely to the extent arising or
resulting from a liability incurred after the Closing under the
associated Lease, License, Material Contract or Indebtedness).

  



  

12.3   _Claim Procedure/Notice of Claim_.

  



  

(a)  A party entitled, or seeking to assert rights, to
indemnification under this _Article XII_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall
give written notification (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") which contains (i) a
description and the amount (the " _Claimed Amount_ "), if then known, of any
Adverse Consequences incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Indemnified Party and (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this _Article XII_ for such Adverse Consequences and
a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor.

  



  

(b)  Within twenty (20) days after delivery of a Claim Notice
(other than a Claim Notice based on a third-party claim), the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
(the " _Response_ ") in which the Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount or
(ii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any or all of
the Claimed Amount and the basis for such dispute (in such an event, the
Response shall be referred to as an " _Objection Notice_ "). If no Response
is delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within such
20-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed that an
amount equal to the entire Claimed Amount shall be payable to the Indemnified
Party and such Claimed Amount shall be promptly paid to the applicable
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c)  In the event that the parties are unable to agree on
whether Adverse Consequences exist or on the amount of such
Adverse Consequences within the 20-day period after delivery of a Claim
Notice, either Purchaser or Seller may (but are not required to do so)
petition or file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution
of such dispute.

  



   

56

 



    

  

(d)  In the event that the Indemnified Party is entitled, or is
seeking to assert rights, to indemnification under this _Article XII_
relating to a third-party claim, the Indemnified Party shall give written
notification to the Indemnifying Party of any demand letter or the
commencement of any suit or other legal proceeding relating to such third-
party claim. Such notification shall be given promptly after receipt by the
Indemnified Party of the demand letter, notice of such suit or proceeding,
shall be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by such
third party (to the extent then in the possession of the Indemnified
Party) and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the
Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such suit or
proceeding and the amount of the claimed Adverse Consequences, if then known;
provided, however, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified
Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any
liability caused by or arising out of such failure, including default
judgments. Within twenty (20) days after delivery of such notification, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume and retain control of the defense of such suit or proceeding with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party for so long as the
Indemnifying Party is diligently defending such suit or proceeding in good
faith; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not assume control
of the defense of a suit or proceeding (A) involving criminal liability, (B)
in which any relief other than monetary damages is sought against the
Indemnified Party, (C) in which increased statutory, enhanced or
treble damages are sought based on willful misconduct, (D) which is
reasonably likely to result in Adverse Consequences that exceed the amount
the Purchaser Indemnitees will be entitled to recover from Seller as a result
of the limitations set forth in this _Article XII_ , or (E) is brought by any
Material Customer or Material Supplier. In addition, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the foregoing, in the event that an Indemnified Party in
good faith determines that (x) the conduct of the defense of any claim, suit
or proceeding or any proposed settlement of any such claim, suit or proceeding
by the Indemnifying Party might be expected to materially adversely affect
the ability of the Indemnified Party to conduct its business (including
relationships with Governmental Authorities) or (y) the Indemnifying Party is
not diligently defending such suit or proceeding in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to take over and assume
control over the defense, settlement or negotiations relating to any such
claim, suit or proceeding at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense at the Indemnifying Party's
expense. The party not controlling such defense (the " _Non-controlling
Party_ ") may participate therein at its own expense; provided, however, that
if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified
Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect
to such suit or proceeding, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party shall be considered "Adverse Consequences" for purposes
of this Agreement. The party controlling such defense (the " _Controlling
Party_ ") shall keep the Non-controlling Party reasonably advised of the
status of such suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider
in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect
thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with
such information as it may have with respect to such suit or proceeding
(including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise
cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such suit or
proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the control of a third-party claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such suit or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be the Controlling Party with respect to
the Pending Claims and Purchaser shall have all rights of the Non-Controlling
Party with respect to the Pending Claims as set forth herein.

12.4   _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants;
Determination of Adverse Consequences_.

  



  

(a)  Except as set forth in _Section 12.4(b)_ , the
representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in
this Agreement and the certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
at which time such representations and warranties and any right to make an
indemnification claim based thereon will terminate.

  



  

(b)  The Statute of Limitations Representations shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations plus one
hundred eighty (180) days, at which time such representations and warranties
and any right to make an indemnification claim based thereon shall terminate.
The representations and warranties of Seller contained in _Section 7.1_ (Due
Organization, Equity Interests), _Section 7.2_ (Authority), _Section 7.3_
(No Violations and Consents), _Section 7.4_  (Brokers) and _Section 7.7(a)_
and (b) (Title to Purchased Assets) (collectively, the " _Unlimited
Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party,
before expiration of the survival period of a representation or warranty,
either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or warranty,
or a notice that, as a result of a suit or other legal proceeding instituted
by or claim made by a third party, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects
to incur Adverse Consequences, then the applicable representation or warranty
shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter
covered by such notice.

  



  

(d)  All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date in accordance with their terms.

  



  

(e)  If a Purchaser Indemnitee's indemnification claim is based
on both a breach of a Seller representation and warranty and either a
Retained Liability or another matter not subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 12.4_ or _12.5_ , such limitations shall not apply or restrict
Purchaser Indemnitee's right to indemnification.

  



  

(f)  The representations and warranties of Seller shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf
of Purchaser or by reason of the fact that Purchaser or any of Purchaser's
representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is or might be inaccurate.

  



   

58

 



    

  

12.5   _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.

  



  

(a)  Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees with respect to Adverse Consequences arising under  _Section
12.1(a)_ (other than the Unlimited Representations and the Statute of
Limitations Representations) until the aggregate amount of all Adverse
Consequences thereunder exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000),
in which event Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees only for the amount of Adverse Consequences in excess of such
threshold.

  



  

(b)  Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees with respect to Adverse Consequences arising under  _Section
12.1(a)_ (other than the Unlimited Representations and the Statute of
Limitations Representations) in excess of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000)
(the " _Cap_ ").

  



  

(c)  The amount of any Adverse Consequences incurred by any
Indemnified Party will be reduced by the net amount such Indemnified Party
actually recovers from any insurer or other party liable for such Adverse
Consequences (other than pursuant to the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy).

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser Indemnitees' rights to indemnification with respect to Adverse
Consequences arising under _Section 12.1(b)_ (but only to the extent it
relates to a breach of a covenant or agreement and not a breach of the
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 9.2_ ), _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_  or
_(f)_ or the Unlimited Representations or the Statute of Limitations
Representations or based upon fraud shall not be subject to the limitations
set forth in _Sections 12.5(a)_ and _12.5(b)_. As used in this Section "fraud"
shall mean: (1) a misrepresentation of material fact; (2) that the Person
making the representation knew or should have known was false; (3) that the
Person making the representation intended that the representation would induce
the other party to rely and act on it; and (4) the party relying on the
representation suffered injury in justifiable reliance on the representation.

  



  

(e)  The Purchaser Indemnitees shall assert all claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)_ and _Section 12.1(f)(ii)_
against the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy to the extent covered
thereby prior to seeking recovery from Seller hereunder. If the Purchaser
Indemnitees incur Adverse Consequences pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)_ (other
than with respect to the Unlimited Representations or the Statute of
Limitations Representations) which Adverse Consequences would have
been covered by the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy but for the
fact that the Purchaser Indemnitees previously recovered under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy for Adverse Consequences arising
from or with respect to breaches of the Unlimited Representations or the
Statute of Limitations Representations or under _Section 12.1(f)(ii)_ , then,
notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall
indemnify and reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees for such
Adverse Consequences in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate
amount of all such Adverse Consequences and (ii) the aggregate amount of
Adverse Consequences arising from or with respect to breaches of the Unlimited
Representations or the Statute of Limitations Representations or under
_Section 12.1(f)(ii)_ that the Purchaser Indemnitees had previously recovered
under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy.

  



   

59

 



    

  

(f)  Any indemnity payments made pursuant to this _Article XII_
shall be treated for all income Tax purposes by the parties hereto as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

(g)  The Purchaser Indemnitees shall mitigate Adverse
Consequences in accordance with applicable Law.

  



  

12.6   _Right of Set-Off_. If Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchaser or
any other Purchaser Indemnitee for any indemnification claim in accordance
with _Article XII_ , Purchaser may set-off the amount of such claim against
any amounts payable by Purchaser or the Company to Seller under this
Agreement, including the Earnout Payments and Catch-Up Payment, as the same
becomes due. If Purchaser intends to set-off any amount hereunder, Purchaser
shall provide not less than twenty (20) days' prior written notice to Seller
of its intention to do so, together with a reasonably detailed explanation of
the basis therefor (a " _Set-Off Notice_ "). If, within ten (10) days of its
receipt of a Set-Off Notice, Seller provides Purchaser with written notice of
Seller's dispute with Purchaser's right to make such set-off, Purchaser and
Seller shall meet in good faith within five (5) days to attempt to resolve
their dispute. If such dispute remains unresolved despite Purchaser's good
faith attempt to meet with Seller and resolve such dispute, Purchaser may
withhold the amount contemplated by the Set-Off Notice until the matter is
resolved. If it is finally determined that Purchaser's claim is valid, then
Purchaser may effect the set-off contemplated by the Set-Off Notice. If it is
finally determined that Purchaser's claim is not valid, then Purchaser shall
promptly pay to Seller the amount withheld pursuant to the Set-Off Notice
plus accrued interest from the date the amount set-off pursuant to the Set-
Off Notice was due to the date such amount is actually paid at an interest
rate equal to the interest rate that Purchaser pays under its senior
revolving credit facility from time to time. For purposes of this Section
12.6, "finally determined" means that the validity and amount of such claim
has either been (x) consented to in writing by Seller (whether pursuant to a
settlement agreement or otherwise) or (y) determined pursuant to a final,
non-appealable judgment or other similar determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction. The cost of any litigation between the parties with
respect to any contested set-off, including reasonable accounting and
attorneys' fees and court costs, costs of expert witnesses and other expenses
of litigation shall be paid in accordance with _Section 16.16_.

  



  

12.7   _Source of Recovery_. Any payment to be made by Seller with respect
to any indemnification obligations for Adverse Consequences pursuant to this
_Article XII_ shall be paid to the Purchaser Indemnitees (i) _first_ , from
the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy if coverage is available,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any retention amount or
deductible thereunder or any matter excluded from coverage thereunder shall
be paid in accordance with _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_  below, (ii) _second_ ,
at Purchaser's sole election, either from the Indemnification Escrow Funds or
by set-off as contemplated by _Section 12.6_ or any combination of the
foregoing and (iii) _thereafter_ , to the extent Seller's
indemnification obligations exceed the funds available described in clauses
(i) and (ii), from Seller, subject in each case to the applicable
limitations set forth in this _Article XII_.

  



  

12.8   _Exclusive Remedy._ The remedies provided in this _Article XII_
constitute the sole and exclusive remedies available to each party hereto for
recoveries against another party hereto for breaches of the _representations_
and warranties having continuing effect after the Closing Date, in this
Agreement or in any Transaction Document.

ARTICLE XIII _ 
 Confidentiality_

  



  

13.1   _Confidentiality of Materials_. (a) The parties hereto agree with
respect to all technical, commercial and other information that is furnished
or disclosed by the other party, including information regarding such party's
(and its subsidiaries' and Affiliates') organization, personnel, business
activities, customers, policies, assets, finances, costs, sales,
revenues, technology, rights, obligations, liabilities and strategies ("
_Information_ "), that, unless and until the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been consummated, (i) such Information is confidential
and/or proprietary to the furnishing/disclosing party and entitled to and
shall receive treatment as such by the receiving party; (ii) the receiving
party will hold in confidence and not disclose nor use (except in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) any such Information,
treating such Information with the same degree of care and confidentiality as
it accords its own confidential and proprietary Information; provided,
however, that the receiving party shall not have any restrictive obligation
with respect to any Information which (A) is contained in a printed
publication available to the general public, (B) is or becomes publicly known
through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving party, or (C) is known
by the receiving party without any proprietary restrictions by the
furnishing/disclosing party at the time of receipt of such Information; and
(iii) all such Information furnished to either party by the other,
unless otherwise specified in writing, shall remain the property of the
furnishing/disclosing party and, in the event this Agreement is terminated,
shall be returned to it, together with any and all copies made thereof, upon
request for such return by it (except for documents submitted to a
Governmental Authority with the consent of the furnishing/disclosing party or
upon subpoena and which cannot be retrieved with reasonable effort) and in
the case of (x) oral information furnished to any party by the other which
shall have been reduced to writing by the receiving party and (y) all
internal documents of any party describing, analyzing or otherwise containing
Information furnished by the other party, all such writings and documents
shall be destroyed, upon request, in the event this Agreement is terminated,
and each party shall confirm in writing to the other compliance with any such
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to erase
electronically stored Information that has been saved to a back-up file in
the ordinary course of business; provided that such Information shall remain
subject to the confidentiality and nonuse provisions of this _Section 13.1_
so long as such information is retained.

  



  

(b)  Seller and Equityholders also each agree with respect to
all Information regarding the Company, the Business and the Purchased Assets
that, from and after the Closing, (i) such Information is confidential and/or
proprietary to Purchaser and entitled to and shall receive treatment as such
by Seller, Equityholders and their respective Affiliates; (ii) Seller and
Equityholders shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, hold in
confidence and not disclose nor use any such Information, treating
such Information with the same degree of care and confidentiality as it or he
accords its own confidential and proprietary information; provided, that
neither Seller nor Equityholders shall have any such obligations with respect
to Information which is of the type described in clauses (A) through (C) of
_Section 13.1(a)(ii)_.

  



  

13.2   _Remedy_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the remedy at law for
any breach by either party of its obligations under  _Section 13.1_ is
inadequate and that the other party shall be entitled to equitable remedies,
including an injunction, in the event of breach by the other party.

  



  

   

61

 



    

ARTICLE XIV _ 
 Employee Matters_

  



  

14.1   _Transferred Employees_. (a) Immediately prior to the Closing,
Seller and its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to cause each of
the employees of the Business who are employed on a full-time basis (other
than Paul Truman or those employees on Long-Term Disability) to be offered
employment with the Company on terms and conditions substantially comparable
to their current terms and conditions of employment as approved by Purchaser.
Seller shall not be obligated to obtain written employment agreements from
any employee other than Estenson, and any such employees of the Business who
accept employment with the Company pursuant to this _Section 14.1(a)_ and are
employed by the Company as of the Closing are referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees". Purchaser may, in its discretion, provide, or cause
the Company to provide, letters or other communications to individuals who
may become Transferred Employees relating to their employment with the Company
following the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Seller shall be solely responsible for any severance claims
or any other claims or causes of action asserted by or with respect to any
employee of the Business who is not a Transferred Employee or as a result of
the transfer of the Transferred Employees to employment with the Company
prior to the Closing (or the offers of employment with the Company), which
amounts shall be included in Transaction Expenses. Seller shall remain solely
responsible for all Liabilities arising from any employment claim made by
a Transferred Employee which arose or is otherwise attributable to an event
or circumstance existing before the Closing. The Company shall be solely
responsible for any employment claim made by a Transferred Employee which
arises after Closing, provided that such claim is not attributable to an
event or circumstance existing before the Closing.

  



  

14.2   _Workers ' Compensation_. Seller shall remain solely responsible for
all Liabilities arising from workers' compensation claims, both medical and
disability, or other government-mandated programs which are based on injuries
allegedly occurring prior to Closing regardless of when such claims are
filed, including those claims set forth on _Schedule 14.2_. The Company shall
be solely responsible for such claims of Transferred Employees based on
injuries allegedly occurring after Closing.

  



  

14.3   _Benefit Plans and Claims_.

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise listed in _Schedule 14.3(a_ ) or
pursuant to the assumption of the collective bargaining agreements set forth
in _Schedule 14.5_ , neither Purchaser nor the Company shall assume any
Benefit Plan or any Liabilities under or with respect thereto and Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall retain the sponsorship of and
all Liabilities under and with respect thereto. Effective immediately prior
to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Benefit Plans that are set forth in
_Schedule 14.3(a)_ and all contracts and agreements (including insurance
contracts or administration agreements) relating thereto (the " _Assumed
Benefit Plans_ ") to be transferred to sponsorship with the Company and to
cause the Company to assume sponsorship thereof and to be substituted for
Seller or its applicable Affiliate thereunder. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary and specifically
notwithstanding the transfer of sponsorship of the Assumed Benefit Plans to,
and the assumption of sponsorship of the Assumed Benefit Plans by, the
Company, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall retain all
Liabilities under and with respect to the Assumed Benefit Plans with respect
to claims incurred prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Assumed Benefit Plan regardless of when the claim is filed
or reported. For purposes of this _Section 14.3(a)_ , (i) a medical, dental
or vision claim is incurred on the date the service is rendered or the
product is purchased; (ii) a life insurance claim is incurred on the date of
the individual's death; and (iii) a disability claim is incurred on the date
the individual becomes disabled under the terms of the applicable Assumed
Benefit Plan.

  



   

62

 



    

  

(b)  Effective immediately prior to the Closing, all Transferred
Employees shall cease to participate in all Benefit Plans for periods
following the Closing, other than the Assumed Benefit Plans, and any employees
of Seller and its Affiliates other than the Transferred Employees shall cease
to participate in the Assumed Benefit Plans. From and after the Closing,
Transferred Employees shall continue to participate in the Assumed Benefit
Plans, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and, effective as of
the Closing, the Transferred Employees shall participate in or shall be
eligible to participate in such other employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained by the Company or Purchaser that are made
available to similarly-situated employees of the Company, including the
Assumed Benefit Plans (the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). In the case of any
Company Benefit Plan that is an Assumed Benefit Plan, a Transferred Employee
who was a participant in the Assumed Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing shall continue participation in the Assumed Benefit Plan without
interruption immediately following the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Assumed Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c)  To the extent applicable, as of the Closing Date, the
Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall be given credit
under each of Company Benefit Plans, for purposes of vesting and eligibility,
for all service with Seller and its Affiliates before the Closing Date to the
same extent such service was credited for such respective purposes by Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date under a corresponding Benefit Plan;
provided, however, that no such credit shall be provided to the extent
such crediting of service would result in the duplication of benefits.

  



  

(d)  To the extent applicable, as of the Closing Date, the
Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall be given credit
under each of the Company Benefit Plans which is an employee welfare benefit
plan (as that term is described in section 3(1) of ERISA), for their service
with Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations, and shall be given credit under any such plan for
amounts paid under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of Company Benefit Plans; provided, however, that credit for deductibles,
copayments and out-of-pocket maximums shall be provided only if the applicable
Transferred Employee provides sufficient information to the applicable
Company Benefit Plan to evidence such amounts. No credit of service or any
amount shall be provided to the extent that such credit would result in
duplication of benefits.

  



  

(e)  Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities in
connection with claims for benefits brought by or in respect of former or
retired employees of the Business or Truline under any of Seller's welfare
benefit plans with respect to medical, dental, life insurance, health,
accident or disability benefits or otherwise and shall provide COBRA
continuation coverage to any "MandA qualified beneficiary" (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.4980B-9) with respect to the Business or
Truline.

  



   

63

 



    

  

(f)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
14.3, in the case of any Transferred Employee who is covered by a collective
bargaining agreement that is assumed by the Company pursuant to _Section 14.5_
, the terms and conditions of employment of such Transferred Employee and the
benefits provided to such Transferred Employee shall be governed by the terms
of the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

  



  

14.4   _401(k) Plan_. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, make available to Transferred
Employees a defined contribution plan that includes a cash or deferred feature
that satisfies the requirements of section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Purchaser 's 401(k) Plan_"). Effective as of the Closing Date,
Transferred Employees who are participants in the Seller's 401(k) Plan shall
have a fully vested and nonforfeitable interest in their respective account
balances thereunder and shall be entitled to a distribution of their account
balances under the Seller's 401(k) Plan. Transferred Employees who receive an
eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of section 402(f)(2) of
the Code) which constitutes a direct rollover distribution within the meaning
of section 401(a)(31) of the Code and regulations thereunder from the
Seller's 401(k) Plan shall, subject to the provisions of section 402 of the
Code and the terms of the Purchaser's 401(k) Plan, be permitted to make a
rollover contribution to the Purchaser's 401(k) Plan. To the extent that,
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.4, a Transferred
Employee is eligible to make a rollover contribution of a direct
rollover distribution (within the meaning of section 401(a)(31) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) to the Purchaser's 401(k) Plan, such rollover
contribution may include promissory notes for loans made to such Transferred
Employee under the terms of the Seller's 401(k) Plan.

  



  

14.5   _Adoption of Collective Bargaining Agreements_. At the Closing,
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , the Company shall assume the collective
bargaining agreements of Seller set forth on _Schedule 14.5_ , including by
executing amended collective bargaining agreements, new participation
agreements or other plan documentation associated with the Multiemployer Plans
to the extent applicable.

  



  

14.6   _ERISA Section 4204_. Seller, Purchaser and the Company hereto
intend to comply with the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the
Multiemployer Plan shall not be deemed a complete or partial withdrawal from
the Multiemployer Plan. Accordingly, Seller, Purchaser and the Company agree
as follows:

  



  

(a)  After the Closing, the Company shall be obligated to make
contributions to the Multiemployer Plan in accordance with any collective
bargaining agreement relating thereto and shall contribute to the
Multiemployer Plan with respect to the Business on the same terms as Seller
had an obligation to contribute to the Multiemployer Plan prior to the
Closing.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the first plan year of the Multiemployer Plan
beginning after the Closing Date, the Company may seek a variance from the
requirements of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA that a bond be obtained or an
amount be held in escrow as provided in said section. The Company and Seller
agree to cooperate with respect to obtaining any such variance (including upon
request of the Company, Seller jointly with the Company and/or Purchaser
notifying the Multiemployer Plan of the parties' intent that the
transaction contemplated hereby be covered by Section 4204 of ERISA) and
sharing such information as may be necessary to determine whether there is a
basis for applying for a variance from the applicable bonding requirements.
Unless and until a variance or exemption is obtained in accordance with
Section 4204(c) of ERISA, Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide to the
Multiemployer Plan, for a period of five plan years commencing with the first
plan year beginning after the Closing Date (the " _Contribution Period_ "), a
bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for
purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or
similar financial institution satisfactory to the Multiemployer Plan, as
applicable, or such other security as may be permitted under Section
4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA or regulations thereunder, in an amount equal to
the greater of:

  



   

64

 



    

  

(i)  the average annual contribution required to be made by
Seller to the Multiemployer Plan with respect to the Business for the three
(3) plan years preceding the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, or

  



  

(ii)  the annual contribution that Seller was required to make
with respect to the Business under the Multiemployer Plan for the last plan
year before the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, which applicable
bond or escrow shall be paid to the Multiemployer Plan if the Company
withdraws from the Multiemployer Plan, or fails to make a contribution to the
Multiemployer Plan when due, at any time during the Contribution Period.

  



  

Seller agrees to cooperate with the Company and Purchaser in connection with
any application for a variance or exemption under Section 4204(c) of ERISA
made by the Company to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or to the
Multiemployer Plan.

  



  

(c)  Purchaser acknowledges that Seller is currently
indemnified by Darigold, Inc., a Washington corporation, pursuant to
the terms of those certain Contracts for the Spokane, Seattle and Portland
locations (the " _Darigold Indemnifications_ ") for unfunded pension
withdrawal liability under the Multiemployer Plan. Seller's rights under the
Darigold Indemnifications are lost if Seller abandons the Contract without
cause or incurs a complete or partial withdrawal during the Contribution
Period. If the Company abandons one or more of Darigold locations subject to
the Darigold Indemnifications or incurs a complete or partial withdrawal from
the Multiemployer Plan, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from any such withdrawal liability, and Seller shall pay to the Multiemployer
Plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from Seller but
for the provisions of this _Section 14.6(c)_.

  



  

14.7   _Cooperation_. Between the date of this Agreement and Closing,
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate to achieve the requirements of this
_Article XIV_ , including amendments to the Assumed Benefit Plans to reflect
the provisions of this _Article XIV_.

  



  

 _14.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall
(a) be treated as an amendment of any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement of any of Seller, Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates, (b) give any third party, including Transferred Employees or any
other employee of the Business or any representative thereof, any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Article XIV_ or (c) obligate Seller,
Purchaser or the Company or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain any
particular benefit plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

  



  

   

65

 



    

ARTICLE XV _ 
 Certain Other Agreements_

  



  

15.1   _Post-Closing Access to Records_. Each party agrees to (i) provide
the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the others
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or report of Taxes, any
audit or other examination by any Governmental Authority, or any judicial or
administrative proceedings relating to liabilities for Taxes or for any
other reasonable purpose, and (ii) provide any information necessary or
reasonably requested to allow Purchaser or the Company to comply with any
information reporting or withholding requirements contained in the Code or
other applicable Laws or to compute the amount of payroll or other employment
Taxes due with respect to any payment made in connection with this Agreement.
Such assistance shall include making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of
material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant
Tax Returns and supporting material. Purchaser, Seller and the Company will
retain for the full period of any statute of limitations and provide the
others with any records or information which may be relevant to such
preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination.

  



  

15.2   _Consents Not Obtained at Closing_. (a) Seller shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser at or
prior to the Closing such consents as are required to allow the assignment by
Seller to the Company of Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under
any Contract or Permit included in the Purchased Assets. To the extent any
Contract or Permit is not capable of being assigned without the consent or
waiver of the other party thereto or any third party (including any
Governmental Authority), or if such assignment or attempted assignment would
constitute a breach thereof or a violation of any Law or Order, neither this
Agreement nor the Bill of Sale shall constitute an assignment or an attempted
assignment of such Contract or Permit.

  



  

(b)  Anything in this Agreement or the Bill of Sale to the
contrary notwithstanding, Seller is not obligated to transfer to the Company
any of their rights and obligations in and to any Contract or Permit without
first having obtained all necessary consents and waivers. After the Closing
Date, Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, and Purchaser and
the Company shall cooperate with Seller at Seller's expense, to obtain any
consents and waivers necessary to convey to the Company all Contracts and
Permits intended to be included in the Purchased Assets.

  



  

(c)  If any such consents and waivers are not obtained with
respect to any Contract or Permit, the Bill of Sale shall constitute an
equitable assignment by Seller to the Company of all of Seller's rights,
benefits, title and interest in and to such Contract or Permit, to the extent
permitted by Law, and the Company shall be deemed to be Seller's agent for the
purpose of completing, fulfilling and discharging all of Seller's rights and
liabilities arising after the Closing Date under such Contract or Permit, and
Seller shall take all necessary steps and actions to provide the Company with
the benefits of such Contract or Permit. Seller shall hold Purchaser and the
Company harmless from any Adverse Consequences to the extent resulting from
Seller's failure to obtain any consent to assignment as required under
_Section 15.2(b)_ ; provided, however, that such Adverse Consequences shall
not have arisen from Purchaser's or the Company's failure to reasonably
cooperate with Seller to obtain such consent or Purchaser's or the Company's
failure to comply with any commercially reasonable requirements imposed
by the party from whom such consent must be obtained; provided further,
however, that Purchaser and the Company shall have no obligation to pay any
amount to any Person, or to accept any change in the terms and conditions of
any Contract or Permit, to obtain such a consent.

  



   

66

 



    

  

15.3   _Avoidance of Double Withholding Taxes_. With respect to
employment Tax matters (i) the Company shall prepare, file and furnish IRS
Form W-2s with respect to Transferred Employees for all wages and other
compensation Seller paid for both the portion of the year prior to and
including the Closing Date and the portion of the year after the Closing Date;
(ii) Seller and the Company shall agree to elect the "alternate procedure"
for predecessors and successors with respect to each Transferred
Employee pursuant to Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 34 I.R.B 320;
and (iii) Seller and the Company shall work in good faith to adopt similar
procedures under applicable wage payment, reporting (including IRS Forms 1094
and 1095) and withholding Laws for all Transferred Employees in all
appropriate jurisdictions.

  



  

15.4   _Bulk Sale Waiver and Indemnity_. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that no filings with respect to any bulk sales or
similar laws have been made, nor are they intended to be made, nor are such
filings a condition precedent to the Closing; and, in consideration of such
waiver by the Company, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser
Indemnitees harmless against any Adverse Consequences to the extent resulting
or arising from such waiver and failure to comply with applicable bulk sales
laws.

  



  

15.5   _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
no Restricted Party shall, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in, carry on,
participate in or have any interest in, whether alone or in conjunction with
any Person, or as a holder of an equity or debt interest of any Person, or as
a principal, agent or otherwise, any business competing with the Business as
conducted prior to the Closing Date by Seller in the United States of
America; (ii) assist others in engaging in any business competing with
the Business in any manner described in the foregoing clause (i); or (iii)
induce any supplier, customer or other Person doing business with the Company
or Purchaser to terminate its relationship with the Company or Purchaser or
otherwise reduce the amount of business that any supplier, customer or other
Person does with the Company or Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, the
business operations of Truline as of the date hereof as described on
_Schedule 15.5_ , and of Mr. Truman solely as an officer and director of
Truline and Truman Trust and Estenson Trust solely as shareholders of
Truline, shall not be deemed to be competitive with the Business, the Company
or Purchaser; provided, however, that Truline shall not solicit or service
dedicated business from any of the customers of the Business identified at
items 1-42 of _Section 7.12(a)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
no Restricted Party shall directly or indirectly solicit for employment or
hire any Transferred Employee that remains an employee of the Company or any
of its Affiliates at the time of or within the six (6) month period prior to
such hiring or solicitation by a Restricted Party or any of their Affiliates.

  



   

67

 



    

  

(c)  Each Restricted Party acknowledges that the restrictions,
prohibitions and other provisions of this _Section 15.5_  are reasonable,
fair and equitable in scope, terms and duration, are necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Purchaser, and are a material inducement to
Purchaser to enter into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  It is the desire and intent of the parties to this
Agreement that the provisions of this _Section 15.5_ shall be enforced to
the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law and public policies
applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if
any particular provision of this _Section 15.5_ shall be adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed amended to delete or
modify (including to limit or reduce its duration, geographical scope,
activity or subject) the portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable,
such deletion or modification to apply only with respect to the operation of
such provision of this _Section 15.5_ in the particular jurisdiction in which
such adjudication is made and to be made only to the extent necessary to
cause the provision as amended to be valid and enforceable.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if any Restricted Party is in violation of its obligations under this
_Section 15.5_ , the applicable restrictive period shall be extended for a
period equal to any time period that such Person is in violation of this
_Section 15.5_.

  



  

(f)  Each Restricted Party acknowledges and understands that
the provisions of this _Section 15.5_ are of a special and unique nature, the
loss of which cannot be accurately compensated for in damages by an action at
law and that the breach of the provisions of this _Section 15.5_ would cause
Purchaser irreparable harm. In the event of a breach or threatened breach
by any Restricted Party or any of their Affiliates of the provisions of
_Section 15.5_ , Purchaser shall be entitled to seek an injunction
restraining it from such breach. Nothing herein contained shall be construed
as prohibiting Purchaser from pursuing any other remedies available for any
breach or threatened breach of this _Section 15.5_ , and the pursuit of an
injunction or any other remedy shall not be deemed to be an exclusive
election of such a remedy.

  



  

15.6   _Use of Estenson Logistics Name_. After the Closing, no Restricted
Party or any Affiliate thereof, may, directly or indirectly, use the name
"Estenson Logistics" or any derivative thereof or any similar name to identify
itself or himself, except that Estenson may use the name "Estenson Logistics:
in connection with his motorcycle racing team until October 31, 2017. Seller
and Equityholders shall be responsible for all filing fees required to be paid
in connection with filing the necessary change of name amendments in the
state of its organization and in each other state in which it is qualified to
transact business.

  



  

15.7   _Equityholders ' Guarantee_. Equityholders hereby, jointly and
severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee for the benefit of
Purchaser, the Purchaser Indemnitees and their respective heirs, successors
and assigns (a) all of the obligations of Seller under this Agreement and
under each other agreement, contract or instrument executed and delivered to
Purchaser by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) Truline's payment when due of all Accounts Receivable owed
by Truline to Seller and that is included in Current Assets.

  



  

15.8   _Taxes_.

  



   

68

 



    

  

(a)  Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall timely file
all Tax Returns to be filed prior to the Closing with respect to the
Purchased Assets, Business, or Transferred Employees, and all Tax Returns of
Seller, and timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. To the
extent any such Tax Return could affect the Taxes of Purchaser or the Company
for any Post-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared
consistently with the practices and procedures of Seller before the date
hereof and Seller shall provide a draft of any such Tax Return to Purchaser
for Purchaser's review and comment at least ten (10) days prior to the due
date of the Tax Return. Seller shall incorporate any timely and reasonable
comments made by Purchaser in any such Tax Return prior to filing.

  



  

(b)  If any Tax relates to a Straddle Period, the parties shall
use the following conventions for determining the portion of such Tax that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion that relates to the
Post-Closing Tax Period: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of Taxes attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the
entire period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period, and
the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be attributable to the Post-Closing
Tax Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, the amount of Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as if a
separate return was filed for the period ending as of the end of the day on
the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology," and the
remaining amount of the Taxes for such period shall be attributable to the
Post-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of clause
(ii), exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
in proportion to the number of days in each such period.

  



  

(c)  Purchaser, the Company and Seller shall (i) assist in the
preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return with respect to the Purchased
Assets, Business or Transferred Employees (or otherwise with respect to the
Company); (ii) assist in any audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
or Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets, Business or Transferred
Employees (or otherwise with respect to the Company); (iii) make available
any information, records, or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax
Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets, Business or Transferred
Employees (or otherwise with respect to the Company); and (iv) provide any
information necessary or reasonably requested to allow Purchaser and the
Company to comply with any information reporting or withholding requirements
contained in the Code or other applicable Laws or to compute the amount of
payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment made in
connection with this Agreement.

  



  

15.9   _Seller 's Existence_. For a period of five (5) years from and after
the Closing, Seller shall remain in existence as a limited liability company
in good standing in the State of Nevada and shall not wind-up or dissolve
without the prior written consent of Purchaser. From and after the Closing,
Seller shall retain sufficient cash (including any portion of the Purchase
Price) necessary to pay the Retained Liabilities and any other debts and
liabilities of Seller in full as they become due (and in any event, Seller
shall retain an amount in cash or marketable securities with respect to each
pending claim listed on _Section 7.10(c)_  of the Disclosure Schedule, Items
8-14, 17, 24, 27-30, 34 and 40 (collectively, the " _Pending Claims_ ") as
set forth in a writing delivered by Seller to the Purchaser prior to Closing
until such claim has been finally determined by the non-appealable decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction or a written settlement agreement and all
amounts owed by Seller in connection therewith have been paid in full), and
Seller shall pay the Retained Liabilities and such debts and liabilities in
full as they become due. At the request of Purchaser, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a certificate confirming its compliance with its obligations
under this _Section 15.9_ , together with a bank or brokerage statement
evidencing its compliance with the minimum requirement set forth above.

  



   

69

 



    

  

15.10   _Guarantees_. From and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to relieve
Estenson, Truman, the Estenson Trust and the Truman Trust, as applicable,
from any continuing obligation under the guarantees set forth on  _Schedule
15.10_ previously provided by them in respect of any Leases, Licenses,
Material Contracts and Indebtedness constituting Assumed Liabilities
(collectively, the "Guarantees"), provided that nothing herein shall require
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to make any payment or grant any
concession in connection therewith.

obligations of the parties hereto shall not be assignable without the prior
written consent of the other parties; provided, however, that Purchaser may

part of its obligations under this Agreement to one of its Affiliates, in
which event all the rights and powers of Purchaser and remedies available to
it under this Agreement shall extend to and be enforceable by each such
Affiliate. Any such assignment and delegation shall not release Purchaser from
