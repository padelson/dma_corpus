Article III 
 EFFECT OF MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY; EXCHANGE

  



  

3.1   _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
the Company or any holder of any securities of Parent or the Company:

  



  

(a)   _Capital Stock of the Company_.

  



  

(i)  Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_,
each share of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding any Cancelled Shares and any Converted
Shares), shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive 0.158 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common
Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(ii)  Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_, all
such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)(i)_, shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist. Each holder
of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A)
the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_, and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.3(h)_, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
accordance with _Section 3.3_.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(iii)  All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as
treasury shares or by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in
each case, not held on behalf of third parties (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company or Parent (" _Converted Shares_ ") shall automatically be converted
into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(iv)  Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Merger as a share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(b)   _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc._ Without limiting the
parties' respective obligations under _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, in
the event of any change in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock,
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in
each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from
and after the date of such event, be used to calculate the Merger
Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section
3.1(b)_.

  



  

3.2   _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company RSU Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then outstanding Company RSU Award, whether vested or
unvested, shall automatically, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, become fully vested and, in lieu of the issuance of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of such Company RSU Award, each outstanding
Company RSU Award shall be cancelled and converted automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (less required withholdings as provided in _Section 3.3(i)_); provided
that if such Company RSU Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Merger Consideration shall be paid on the applicable settlement date for such
Company RSU Award if required by the terms of the applicable award agreement
to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(b)   _Company PSU Awards_. Except as provided with respect to
the New Company PSU Awards in _Section 3.2(c)_ , immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each then outstanding Company PSU Award, whether vested or
unvested, shall automatically, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, become vested (with performance-based vesting to be deemed
satisfied as if performance had been achieved at the target level ( _i.e.,_
100%)) and, in lieu of the issuance of the target number of shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of such Company PSU Award, each then outstanding
Company PSU Award shall be cancelled and converted automatically, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company PSU Award (with such number of shares determined by deeming the
applicable performance goals to be achieved at the target level of performance
( _i.e.,_ 100%) (less required withholdings as provided in _Section
3.3(i)_); provided that if such Company PSU Award is subject to Section 409A
of the Code, the Merger Consideration shall be paid on the applicable
settlement date for such Company PSU Award if required by the terms of
the applicable award agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Any
Company PSUs that do not vest as described in the immediately preceding
sentence ( _i.e.,_ any Company PSUs that would have been earned if performance
was achieved in excess of target) shall be canceled for no consideration.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(c)   _New Company PSU Awards_. The Company shall grant the New
Company PSU Awards (as defined on _Schedule 3.2(c)_  of the Company
Disclosure Letter) at the times, to the individuals, and on the terms and in
the amounts, set forth on _Schedule 3.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding New Company PSU
Award shall, automatically, and without any action on the part of the holder,
be assumed or substituted by Parent and converted automatically into a
restricted stock unit award with respect to a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the New Company PSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio and
rounding the resulting number to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Assumed PSU Award_ "). Each Parent Assumed
PSU Award shall remain outstanding under the 2015 Company Equity Plan and
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
to the New Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
including any performance-based vesting terms (and which for the avoidance of
doubt shall not become vested upon the Effective Time and may, subject to the
achievement of applicable performance goals following the Closing, be earned
at the levels set forth in the applicable award agreement).

  



  

(d) _Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding In-the-Money Company Option shall, whether vested or
unvested, automatically become fully vested and each then outstanding In-the-
Money Company Option shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive, in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such In-the-
Money Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration (less required withholdings as provided in _Section
3.3(i)_). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding Out-
of-the-Money Company Option shall, to the extent unvested, automatically
become fully vested, and each then outstanding Out-of-the-Money Company Option
shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration.

  



  

(e)   _Company Stock Bonus Awards_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Stock Bonus Award, whether
vested or unvested, shall automatically, and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, become fully vested and, in lieu of the issuance of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such Company Stock Bonus Award,
each outstanding Company Stock Bonus Award shall be cancelled and converted
automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Bonus Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (less required withholdings as provided in
_Section 3.3(i)_); provided that if such Company Stock Bonus Award is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Merger Consideration shall be
paid on the applicable settlement date for such Company Stock Bonus Award if
required by the terms of the applicable award agreement to comply with
Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(f)   _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board and/or the duly authorized compensation committee of the
Company Board shall adopt resolutions approving the treatment of the Company
Equity Awards pursuant to the terms of this  _Section 3.2_, to the extent
applicable.

  



  

(g)   _Surviving Corporation/Parent Actions_. The Surviving
Corporation shall take all necessary actions promptly following the Effective
Time to pay the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of the Company
Equity Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this
_Section 3.2_ and _Section 3.3_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take such actions as are necessary to reserve for issuance a number of
authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
settlement of the Parent Assumed PSU Awards. Not later than the Effective
Time, to the extent necessary, Parent shall, with respect to the Parent
Assumed PSU Awards, file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 or
Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor form), or another appropriate
form with respect to such Parent Common Stock and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as
soon as practicable following such filing and, thereafter, until all Parent
Assumed PSU Awards have been settled, the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement.

  



  

3.3   _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Company's transfer agent,
or another firm reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, to act as
agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration and cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_ and in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ to
which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. On
the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for distribution in accordance
with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting at least the amounts necessary to satisfy
the payment of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this
_Article III_. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund to the holders of Company
Common Stock. Except as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_ and _Sections_
_3.3(g)_  and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with _Section 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting
from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of
the Exchange Fund.

(b)   _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event more than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, of (A) shares represented by a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each
case other than Cancelled Shares or Converted Shares, a letter of transmittal
(" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_.

  



  

(ii) Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that has
been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration,
upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share,
together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in noncertificated book-entry form unless
a physical certificate is requested by such holder) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i) _and (B)
a check in the amount of any cash payable for dividends or
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and cash payable in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
3.3(h)_, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(iii)  If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock,
it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
_Section 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender (A) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock, (B) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_.

(c)   _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration
(including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_) paid upon the
surrender of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be
closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares
of Company Common Stock described in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_), any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the
Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former common shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, in each case without interest thereon, to
which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for such amounts.

  



  

(e)   _No Liability_. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time
that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)   _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock described in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(g)_.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(g)   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in
each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
subsequent payment date with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ (ii) the volume
weighted average price of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive
trading days ending on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg L.P. As promptly as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder), the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(i)   _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Laws.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

  



  

Article IV

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent on or prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as disclosed
in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein
and excluding any disclosures set forth or referenced in any risk factor
section or in any other section, in each case, to the extent they

forward-looking in nature), it being understood that any matter disclosed in
such Company SEC Documents shall not be deemed disclosed for purposes of
_Section 4.2(a)_, and _Section 4.2(b)_ of this Agreement, the Company

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Colorado, with all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, other than where the failure to be so
organized or to have such power or authority has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). The Company is duly qualified and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify or
be in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation, partnership or limited liability
company duly organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
with all requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than
where the failure to be so organized or to have such power or authority has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company
is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing
of its properties, makes such qualification necessary, other than where the
failure to so qualify or be in good standing has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries that is, as of the date of this Agreement, a
"significant subsidiary" as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X (in each

to execute and deliver this Agreement, perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Transactions, subject, with respect to consummation of the

therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has made
all certifications and statements required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") with respect to the

controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of the Company by others within those entities in connection
with the reports it files under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed in any Company SEC Documents are recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and further designed and maintained to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of

preceding six (6) years, no Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by
the Company or its ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a risk

of ERISA.

  



  

(f)  None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6)
years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a

17

in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the
date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of the
Company, except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of the Company.

  



  

(i) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted against (i) the
Company Benefit Plans, (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or (iii)
the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans, except
as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to result in a material liability of the Company.

  



  

(j)  No Company Benefit Plan exists that, as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in conjunction
with any other event) will (i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or
set aside any assets to fund, any material benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan, (ii) increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) result in any limitation on the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust, or (iv) result in any
payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations §
1.280G-1) that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). For purposes of this representation, no
arrangements or agreements that may be implemented by or at the direction of
Parent, no New Company PSU Awards or Parent Assumed PSU Awards and no

qualifications, reservations and encumbrances contained in any Company SEC
Document, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which has not had and

(a)  Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
and except for property (i) sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business since the dates of the reserve report prepared by Ryder
Scott Company, L.P. (in such capacity, the " _Company Independent Petroleum
Engineers_ ") relating to the Company interests referred to therein as of
December 31, 2018 (the " _Company Reserve Report_ ") or (ii) reflected in the
Company Reserve Report or in the Company SEC Documents as having been sold or
otherwise disposed of, as of the date hereof, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties
forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Report
(the " _Company Oil and Gas Properties_ ") and in each case as attributable

Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that the Company's or
one or more of its Subsidiaries', as applicable, title (as of the date hereof

Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (B) obligates
the Company (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a
percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of,

proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas
Properties) and (C) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

  



  

(b)  Except for any such matters that, individually or in the

by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the Company Independent
Petroleum Engineers relating to the Company interests referred to in the
Company Reserve Report was, as of the time provided, accurate in all
respects. Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in
the Company Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been prepared by
the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates
fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company at
the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines
applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration,
development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices)
and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the

royalties, overriding royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to
any Company Oil and Gas Properties have been timely and properly paid, (iii)
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no third-party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or
failed to take any action that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Company Oil and
Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such
Company Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Company Oil and Gas Properties.

  



  

(d)  Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
all proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Company Oil and
Gas Properties are being received by such selling entities in a timely manner
and no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from any such Company
Oil and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any other Person or
individual) for any reason other than (i) as reported in the Company SEC
Documents or (ii) awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled Wells. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
is obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar
payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties and similar

Article V 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by Parent to the Company on or prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as disclosed in
the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein
and excluding any disclosures set forth or referenced in any risk factor
section or in any other section, in each case, to the extent they
are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive, non-specific or
forward-looking in nature), it being understood that any matter disclosed in
such Parent SEC Documents shall not be deemed disclosed for purposes of
_Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_ of this Agreement, Parent represents

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware, with all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted, other than where the failure to be so organized or to have
such power or authority has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Parent Material Adverse
Effect_ "). Parent is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation,
ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification necessary,
other than where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of Parent is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly organized, as
the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all requisite entity
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, other than where the failure to be so
organized or to have such power or authority has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of Parent is duly qualified
and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business
it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties,
makes such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to
so qualify or be in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has heretofore made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the Organizational Documents of Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries that is, as of the date of this Agreement, a "significant
subsidiary" as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X (in each case, as
amended prior to the date of this Agreement).

agreements to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
it is bound relating to the voting of any shares of the Parent Capital Stock

under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in any Parent SEC
Documents are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and further designed and
maintained to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
Parent's financial reporting and the preparation of Parent financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Except as set

encumbrances contained in any Parent SEC Document, except for such Rights-of-
Way the absence of which has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all of its
material obligations with respect to such Rights-of-Way and conducts its
business in a manner that does not violate any Rights-of-Way, except for such
non-fulfillment, non-performance or violation that have not had and would not

action that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute
a default under the provisions of any Parent Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle

included in the Parent Oil and Gas Properties.

  



  

(d) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

Gas Properties are being received by such selling entities in a timely manner
and no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from any such Parent
Oil and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any other Person or
individual) for any reason other than (i) as reported in the Parent SEC
Documents or (ii) awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled Wells. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries is
obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar
payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties and similar arrangements
established in the Oil and Gas Leases) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds
from the sale thereof, attributable to such Person's interest in its Oil and
Gas Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at

forth in this _Section 6.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no non-public
information that is prohibited from being furnished pursuant to this _Section
6.3_ may be furnished until the Company receives an executed confidentiality
agreement from such Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure
of nonpublic information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company that are no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that such
confidentiality agreement does not contain provisions that prohibit the
Company from complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.3_, and (B)
prior to and as a condition to taking any such actions, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal is, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii) prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, in
response to a Company Competing Proposal that did not arise from a breach of

chooses, cause the Company to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, if prior and as a
condition to taking such action (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that (x) such Company Competing Proposal is a Company Superior
Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of
the Merger proposed by Parent in response to such Company Competing Proposal)
and (y) the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's shareholders
under applicable Law and (B) the Company shall have given five (5)
Business Days' prior notice to Parent that the Company has received such
proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal

prior to effecting such Company Change of Recommendation or termination,
the Company negotiates (and causes its officers, employees, financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with Parent
(to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), which negotiations may be on a
nonexclusive basis with respect to other negotiations or discussions
permitted by this _Section 6.3_, to make such adjustments or revisions to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Company Competing
Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal and (2) at
the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect
a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(1)_, the Company Board takes into account any adjustments or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent in writing,
and determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that (x) the Company Competing Proposal remains
a Company Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company's shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the event of
any change to the financial terms of, or any other material amendment or
material modification to, any Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.3(f)(iii) _with respect to such new written
notice, except that the advance written notice obligation set forth in this
_Section 6.3(f)(iii) _shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days; and

financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, (B) the
Company shall have given five (5) Business Days' prior notice to Parent
that the Company has determined that a Company Intervening Event has occurred
or arisen (which notice will reasonably describe such Company Intervening
Event) and that the Company intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation, and (1) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such
Company Change of Recommendation, the Company negotiates (and causes
its officers, employees, financial advisors and outside legal counsel to
negotiate) in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and (2) at the end of the
five (5) Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company Board takes into account any
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
writing and any other information offered by Parent in response to the
notice, and determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by
the Company Board to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ that, in the event of any material changes regarding any Company
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section

other negotiations or discussions permitted by this _Section 6.4_ , to make
such adjustments or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that the Parent Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Parent
Superior Proposal; and (2) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period,
prior to taking action to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation
or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ , the Parent Board
takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement committed to by the Company in writing, and determines in good
faith, after consultation with Parent's financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (x) the Parent Competing Proposal remains a Parent
Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to Parent's
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the event of any
change to the financial terms of, or any other material amendment or material
modification to, any Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to the Company and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.4(f)(iii)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the advance written notice obligation set forth in this
_Section 6.4(f)(iii)_ shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days; and

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to a
Parent Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this
Agreement, Parent may, if the Parent Board so chooses, effect a Parent Change
of Recommendation if prior to and as a condition to taking such action (A) the
Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Parent's
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to Parent's stockholders under applicable Law, (B) Parent shall
have given five (5) Business Days' prior notice to the Company that Parent
has determined that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred or arisen (which
notice will reasonably describe such Parent Intervening Event) and that
Parent intends to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, and (1) after
giving such notice and prior to effecting such Parent Change of
Recommendation, Parent negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would permit Parent Board not to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in
response thereto; and (2) at the end of the five (5) Business Day
period, prior to taking action to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation,
Parent Board takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by the Company in writing and any other information
offered by the Company in response to the notice, and determines in good
faith, after consultation with Parent's financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in
response to such Parent Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by Parent Board to
Parent's stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the event of
any material changes regarding any Parent Intervening Event, Parent shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to the Company and to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 6.4(g)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the advance written notice obligation set forth in this
_Section 6.4(g)_ shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days.

6.5   _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement_.

  



  

(a)  Parent and the Company will promptly furnish to the other
party such data and information relating to it, its respective Subsidiaries
and the holders of its capital stock, as the Company or Parent, as applicable,
may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information
in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, and, in each case,
any amendments or supplements thereto.

  



  

(b)  Promptly following the date hereof, (i) the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in preparing, and the Company shall cause to be filed
with the SEC as promptly as practicable, a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy
Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders of Company
Common Stock at the Company Shareholders Meeting and the holders of Parent
Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (of which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon
after such filing as reasonably practicable and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will
advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for
additional information, and Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare any
response to such comments or requests, and each of the Company and
Parent agrees to permit the other (in each case, to the extent practicable),
and their respective outside counsels, to participate in all meetings and
conferences with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with
the SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the
Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and
Parent will (A) provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of
such document or response), (B) include in such document or response all
comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other and (C) not file or
mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of
the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings
with respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each party shall advise the other, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts
to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated.

  



  

(d)  If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company and the stockholders of
Parent.

  



  

6.6   _Company Shareholders Meeting and Parent Stockholders
Meeting_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance
with applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the declaration of effectiveness of
the Registration Statement and the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by
the SEC. Except as expressly permitted by _Section  6.3_, the Company Board
shall recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the
approval of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting and the
Company Board shall solicit from shareholders of the Company proxies in favor
of the approval of this Agreement, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include
a statement to the effect that the Company Board has made the Company Board
Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement that is required to be
filed and disseminated under applicable Law is provided to the Company's
shareholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct business at such Company Shareholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn
or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably determines
in good faith that there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed
to by the parties, the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for
which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such
Company Shareholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_ exist,
and such Company Shareholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every
time the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to
the End Date. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting that have
been prepared by the Company or the Company's transfer agent, proxy solicitor
or other Representative and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed
on a reasonably current basis regarding the status of the solicitation and
any material oral or written communications from or to the Company's
shareholders with respect thereto.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(b)  Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the declaration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the
SEC. Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.4_ , the Parent Board
shall recommend that the stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the Parent
Common Stock Issuance at the Parent Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Board
shall solicit from stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of the Parent
Common Stock Issuance, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Parent Board has made the Parent Board
Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement that is required to be
filed and disseminated under applicable Law is provided to Parent's
stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct business at such Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn
or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Parent reasonably determines in
good faith that there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the
meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_ exist,
and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to
the End Date. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting that have been
prepared by Parent or Parent's transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other
Representative and shall otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding the status of the solicitation and any
material oral or written communications from or to Parent's stockholders with
respect thereto.

  



  

(c) The parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting on the same day and at approximately the same time. Unless there has
been a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation,
as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.4_, respectively,
the parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against any efforts by any of the Company's shareholders, Parent's
stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Company Shareholder
Approval and Parent Stockholder Approval from being obtained.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(d)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, the
Company and Parent agree that (i) their respective obligations to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not
be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent
Change of Recommendation, as applicable, (ii) the Company's
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company of
any Company Competing Proposal or other proposal (including, a Company
Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening
Event and (iii) Parent's obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.6_
shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or
communication to Parent of any Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal
(including, a Parent Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any
Parent Intervening Event.

  



  

6.7   _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this
_Section 6.7_, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
shareholders/stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. Each party shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and its Representatives,
during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, reasonable access,
at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, key
employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such party
and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and documents and
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably
promptly to the other party and its Representatives such information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties, contracts, records
and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on
behalf of the other party. Each party and its Representatives shall conduct
any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the other party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise
cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
the employees of the other party and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.7(a)_, neither
party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant
access or furnish information to the other party or any of
its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that such
access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law
or an existing contract or agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Company
or Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other party as to the general
nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall have access to personnel
records of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information that
in the other party's good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject
the other party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of
liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be permitted to
conduct any sampling or analysis of any environmental media or building
materials at any facility of the other party or its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the other party, which may be granted or withheld in
such other party's sole discretion. Each party agrees that (i)
no investigation or information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.7_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
the Company or Parent herein and (ii) it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.7_ for any purpose unrelated to the evaluation, negotiation or
consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b)  The Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2019,
between Parent and the Company (as amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or
hereunder. All information provided to any party or its Representatives
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be
"Confidential Information" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

6.8   _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(b)  Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to
Antitrust Laws to which _Section 6.8(c)_, _Section 6.8(d)_ and _Section
6.8(e)_, and not this _Section 6.8(b)_, shall apply, promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, the parties shall proceed to prepare and file
with the appropriate Governmental Entities all authorizations,
consents, notifications, certifications, registrations, declarations and
filings that are necessary in order to consummate the Transactions and shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters. Neither party nor its Subsidiaries
shall agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to
obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of
waiting periods or authorizations in connection with the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the parties shall make
any filings required under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with each
other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of any filings under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the
prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to and substantially comply with any request for information
or documentary material from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing,
applying, administering, or investigating any Antitrust Law, including the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States, or any other
competition authority of any other jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ ").
Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, in connection with the efforts referenced in this _Section
6.8_, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) promptly notify the other party of any communication
concerning this Agreement or any of the Transactions to that party from or
with any Governmental Entity, or from any other Person alleging that the
consent of such person (or another Person) is or may be required
in connection with the Transactions, and consider in good faith the views of
the other party and keep the other party reasonably informed of the status of
matters related to the Transactions, including furnishing the other party with
any written notices or other communications received by such party from, or
given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions, except that any materials
concerning one party's valuation of the other party may be redacted; and
(iii) permit the other party to review in draft any proposed communication to
be submitted by it to any Governmental Entity with reasonable time and
opportunity to comment, and consult with each other in advance of any in-
person or telephonic meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Entity or
Person, not participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity relating to any filings or investigations concerning this Agreement or
any of the Transactions unless it consults with the other party and its
Representatives in advance and invites the other party's Representatives to
attend in accordance with applicable Laws. The parties shall take reasonable
efforts to preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
joint defense privilege or any other privilege with respect to
any information shared pursuant to this _Section 6.8(c)_.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent
shall take any and all action necessary, including, but not limited, to (i)
selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell
or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or
other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; or (v)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications
with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in
the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
its or their businesses or assets (each, a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to
ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law
or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining
or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust
Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the
consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any Divestiture Action or other action
that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
an adverse effect on the business, financial conditions or operations of
Parent and the Company on a combined basis, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger which effect would be a material adverse effect relative
to a company that is of a size and scope substantially similar to the
Company, taken as a whole. The Company shall not take or agree to take any
Divestiture Action unless requested in writing by Parent, provided that the
Company shall not be required to take any Divestiture Action reasonably
requested by Parent unless such action is only effective after the Effective
Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(e)  In the event that any action is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take
such action, including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid,
resist or resolve such action ( _provided_  that in no event shall this
_Section 6.8(e)_ require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture
Action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an adverse effect on the business, financial conditions or
operations of Parent and the Company on a combined basis, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the Merger which effect would be a material adverse
effect relative to a company that is of a size and scope substantially similar
to the Company, taken as a whole). Subject to the terms of this _Section
6.8_, including the immediately foregoing sentence, in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding that would
make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take
promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date.

  



  

(f)  Neither the Company nor Parent shall take any action that
could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay obtaining clearance, or the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, under the HSR Act.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

6.9   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Parent will provide the Company a complete list of employees that
Parent will be (i) offering continuing employment with Parent or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) offering transitional employment with Parent or its
Subsidiaries until the end of a specified transition date or (iii) informing
that their employment will terminate on the Closing Date. As of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
to, employ each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to
be employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (each employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") and to provide to
each such Continuing Employee the base salary or wages and annual target cash
bonus opportunity or semi-annual cash bonus opportunity, as applicable, in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans and all plans, programs, practices, policies, arrangements and
agreements referenced on _Schedule 3.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall,
after the Effective Time, prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plan, or
compensation arrangement or agreement in accordance with its terms or impose
on the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries any obligation to
retain any employee for any amount of time. During the period commencing as
of the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing (such
period, the " _Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall, and
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide each Continuing Employee
with, during the Continuation Period, severance payments, rights and/or
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments, rights
and/or benefits under the applicable Company Benefit Plans set forth on
_Schedule 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(b)  With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees immediately prior to Closing
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New
Plans_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
provide each such Continuing Employee and his or her spouse and/or eligible
dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee or his or her spouse and/or dependent prior to the Effective
Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was
given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time)
in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such
Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in
any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_  that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services.

  



  

(c)  Except with respect to Parent Assumed PSU Awards pursuant
to _Section 3.2(c)_ , Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control"
(or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur
at the Effective Time.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Affiliates any right
to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, or any
Affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate thereof to discharge or
terminate the services of any employee, director or consultant of the Company
or any of its Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, subject to the terms of any employment agreement, severance
agreement, arrangement, plan, policy, program or practice or other similar
agreement, arrangement, plan, policy, program or practice. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time
except, during the Continuation Period, Parent shall not amend, modify or
terminate in any manner adverse to the relevant employees any severance
payments or benefits contained in the Company Benefit Plans set forth on
_Schedule 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of _Section 9.7_, nothing in this
_Section 6.9_, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including any current or former employee, director or consultant of
the Company or any of its Affiliates, any third party beneficiary or other
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

6.10   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified
Person may have pursuant to any employment agreement or

(a)  Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been
represented by counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same
with the advice of said independent counsel. Each party and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents
referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between
the parties shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not
be construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission
or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such items are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be,
or that such items have resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual
sections of each of the Parent Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure
Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed
to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in sections
corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely for convenience, and
the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, notwithstanding the
presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations
or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto, and (i) for purposes
of _Schedule 6.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, any item disclosed in
response to any subclause of _Schedule 6.1_ shall be deemed to be disclosed
in response to each other subclause of _Schedule 6.1_  to the extent that the
relevance of such item to such subclause is reasonably apparent and (ii) for
purposes of _Schedule 6.2_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, any item
disclosed in response to any subclause of _Schedule 6.2_ shall be deemed to
be disclosed in response to each other subclause of _Schedule 6.2_ to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such subclause is reasonably
apparent.

  



  

(c)  The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality
of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or
controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to Mountain time. The

constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

9.9   _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
in violation of this _Section 9.10_ shall be void.

  



  

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this _Section 9.11_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each party accordingly
agrees (a) the non-breaching party will be entitled to injunctive and other
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages; (b) the breaching party
will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement and will not plead in defense thereto that
there would be an adequate remedy at Law; and (c) the breaching party agrees
to waive any requirement that the non-breaching party obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.11_, all in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 9.11_. If prior to the End Date, any party
hereto brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended by such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action.

  



  

   

91

 



    



  

9.12   _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may only
be amended, modified or supplemented by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

Company and Parent may, to the extent legally permitted: (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party
hereunder; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other party contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure
or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. No
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.
