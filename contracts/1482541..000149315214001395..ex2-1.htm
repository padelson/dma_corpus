papers and take such further actions as may be reasonably required or
desirable to carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions

documents or other papers, the execution and delivery of which are necessary
or appropriate to the Closing.

  



  

5.3 _Confidentiality._  In the event the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, SURNA, and SRG and the respective
parties principal executive officers agree to keep confidential any
information disclosed to each other in connection therewith for a period of
three (3) years from the date hereof; provided, however, such obligation shall

the same are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

justification. The decision of the arbitrator shall be written, shall be in
accordance with applicable law and with this Agreement, and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusion of law which shall set

shall be held exclusively in Clark County, Nevada.

copy hereof, but all of which together shall consider but one and the same

party.
