liability to any WPZ Group Entity or any other Person, or any other remedy in connection herewith,
based upon the distribution to any WPZ Group Entity of, or any WPZ Group Entity&#146;s use of or
reliance on, any such information or any information, documents or material made available to the
WPZ Group Parties in any &#147;data rooms,&#148; &#147;virtual data rooms,&#148; management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by or pursuant to action taken by their (or their
general partner&#146;s or their managing member&#146;s general partner&#146;s) respective boards of directors or
conflicts committees, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection
with the Merger and related transactions by the Holders of WMZ Common Units, but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such unitholders
without such further approval. No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. The failure of a party to
exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in
the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Except as
provided in <U>Article&nbsp;II</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;5.11</U>, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder. No party hereto
may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any
attempted assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be
null, void and ineffective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.5 <I>Severability</I>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.
