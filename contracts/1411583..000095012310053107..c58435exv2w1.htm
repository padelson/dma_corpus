MERGER 

  

 SECTION 2.1 _Closing of the Merger._  

  

 (a) _Closing Date._ Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing set forth in _Article VI_, the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.1_ shall be held at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP at 1801 California Street, Denver, Colorado 80202 on the next Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than conditions that would normally be satisfied on the Closing Date) commencing at 9:00 a.m., local time, or such other place, date and time as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto. The " _Closing Date_ ," as referred to herein, shall mean the date of the Closing. 

   

 (b) _Merger._ At the Closing, the Merger shall occur by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and time of such filing (or such later time and date as may be expressed therein as the effective date and time of the Merger) being the " _Effective Time_ "). As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and WMZ shall continue as the surviving limited partnership in the Merger. 

   

 (c) _Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of WPZ, Operating Company, Merger Sub, WMZ, WMZ General Partner, any Holder of WMZ Units or any other Person: 

    

 (i) Each of the outstanding WMZ Common Units, other than the WMZ Common Units owned by WMZ General Partner, shall be converted into the right to receive 0.7584 of one WPZ Common Unit, which WPZ Common Units shall be duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with applicable Laws and the WPZ Partnership Agreement, fully paid and non-assessable (except to the extent such non-assessability may be affected by DRULPA or the provisions of the WPZ Partnership Agreement). Each WMZ Common Unit converted into the right to receive WPZ Common Units pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ (such amount of WPZ Common Units the " _WMZ Consideration_ ") shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Holder of WMZ Common Units immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to be a limited partner of WMZ or have 

   ##### 

  

    

any rights with respect to such WMZ Common Units, except the right to be
admitted to WPZ as a limited partner of WPZ and receive the WPZ Common Units
to be issued in consideration therefor and any distributions to which Holders
of WMZ Common Units become entitled all in accordance with this _Article II_
upon the Surrender of (A) a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented WMZ Common Units (a " _WMZ Certificate_ ") or (B)
uncertificated WMZ Common Units represented in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry
WMZ Common Units_ "). 

   

 (ii) Each of the outstanding WMZ Units owned by WMZ General Partner shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without consideration therefor and without any further action by any person; _provided_ , _however_ , that WMZ General Partner shall continue as the sole general partner of WMZ with a general partner interest which constitutes 2% of the aggregate partnership interest (as defined in DRULPA) of all partners in WMZ. Each outstanding limited liability company interest in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled. Operating Company agrees that at the Effective Time, Operating Company shall be automatically bound by the WMZ Partnership Agreement (as amended and restated at the Effective Time), and Operating Company shall be admitted to WMZ as a limited partner of WMZ with a limited partner interest which constitutes 98% of the aggregate partnership interest (as defined in DRULPA) of all partners in WMZ immediately upon the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the books and records of WMZ shall be revised to reflect the admission of Operating Company as a limited partner of WMZ and all other limited partners of WMZ simultaneously ceasing to be limited partners of WMZ, and WMZ shall continue without dissolution. Immediately after the Effective Time, Operating Company will be the sole limited partner of WMZ and the WMZ General Partner will be the sole general partner of WMZ. 

   

 (iii) Operating Companys limited liability company interests outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and remain outstanding and WPZ shall continue as the sole member of Operating Company. 

   

 (iv) WPZs partnership interests issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and remain outstanding and each limited partner and general partner admitted to WPZ immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as a limited partner and general partner, as applicable. 

  

 The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, the WMZ Partnership Agreement shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto, and, as so amended and restated, shall continue in effect until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. WPZ General Partner consents to the admission to WPZ as a limited partner of WPZ of each Holder of WMZ Common Units who is issued WPZ Common Units in exchange for such Holders WMZ Common Units in accordance with this _Article II_ upon the proper Surrender of a WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units. Upon such Surrender of a WMZ Certificate (or upon a waiver of the requirement to Surrender a WMZ Certificate granted by WPZ General Partner in its sole discretion) or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units and the 

   ##### 

  

 

recording of the name of such Person as a limited partner of WPZ (and as the
Record Holder (as such term is defined in the WPZ Partnership Agreement) of
such WPZ Common Units) on the books and records of WPZ and its Transfer Agent
(as such term is defined in the WPZ Partnership Agreement), such Person shall
automatically and effective as of the Effective Time be admitted to WPZ as
a limited partner of WPZ and be bound by the WPZ Partnership Agreement as
such. By its Surrender of a WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units,
or by its acceptance of WPZ Common Units, a Holder of WMZ Common Units
confirms its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the
WPZ Partnership Agreement, including the power of attorney granted in _Section
2.6_ thereof. 

   

 (d) _Fractional Units._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional WPZ Common Units shall be issued, and such fractional units will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a unitholder of WPZ and (ii) each registered Holder of WMZ Common Units exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional WPZ Common Unit (after taking into account all WMZ Common Units held by such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall receive, in lieu thereof, from WPZ in exchange for such fractional unit, an amount (a " _Fractional Unit Payment_ ") in cash (payable in dollars, without interest) equal to the product of (A) such fraction, multiplied by (B) the average of the closing price of WPZ Common Units on the NYSE Composite Transaction Reporting System as reported in The Wall Street Journal (but subject to correction for typographical or other manifest errors in such reporting) over the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) _Certain Adjustments._ If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the outstanding WMZ Common Units or WPZ Common Units shall be changed into a different number of units or other securities by reason of any split, combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other similar transaction, or any distribution payable in equity securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, the Exchange Ratio (and the number of WPZ Common Units issuable in the Merger) and the form of securities issuable in the Merger shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the Holders of WMZ Common Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 (f) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, WPZ shall appoint Computershare Inc., together with its subsidiary Computershare Trust Company, N.A., to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the WPZ Common Units and any Fractional Unit Payment. At or prior to the Closing Date, WPZ shall (i) deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of WMZ Common Units, an amount of cash equal to the estimated aggregate Fractional Unit Payment (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), (ii) reserve with the Exchange Agent the WPZ Common Units to be issued as WMZ Consideration and (iii) authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange WPZ Common Units in accordance with this _Section 2.1_. WPZ shall deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional funds in excess of the Exchange Fund as and when necessary to pay any Fractional Unit Payment and other amounts required to be paid under this Agreement. WPZ shall pay all costs and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange process. Any WPZ Common Units, or fraction thereof, and any remaining amount of the Exchange Fund or other funds deposited shall be returned to WPZ after the earlier to occur of (1) payment in full of all amounts 

   ##### 

  

  

due to the Holders of WMZ Common Units or to the Exchange Agent or (2) the
expiration of the period specified in _Section 2.1(j)_. 

  

 (g) _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, WPZ shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder, as of the Effective Time, of WMZ Common Units (other than the WMZ General Partner) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the WMZ Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the WMZ Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry WMZ Common Units, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which shall have such other provisions as may be necessary for the Holders of WMZ Common Units to be admitted to WPZ as limited partners of WPZ and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as WPZ General Partner and WMZ General Partner may reasonably specify) and instructions for effecting the Surrender of such WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units in exchange for the WPZ Common Units, together with any distributions with respect thereto and any Fractional Unit Payment. Upon Surrender to the Exchange Agent of such WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units, together with such properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the Holder of a WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units shall be entitled to (i) the number of full WPZ Common Units (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) into which the WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units Surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the Fractional Unit Payment, if any, payable in redemption of any fractional WPZ Common Unit otherwise issuable. The instructions for effecting the Surrender of WMZ Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken by the Holder of any WMZ Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or stolen. It shall be a condition to the right of such Holder to receive WPZ Common Units and the Fractional Unit Payment, if any, that the Exchange Agent shall have received, along with the Letter of Transmittal, a duly executed lost certificate affidavit, including an agreement to indemnify WPZ, signed exactly as the name or names of the registered Holder or Holders appeared on the books of WMZ immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond and such other documents as WPZ may reasonably require in connection therewith. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of WMZ or its transfer agent of WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units; and if such WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units are presented to WMZ or its transfer agent for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the WPZ Common Units and any Fractional Unit Payment as hereinabove provided. Until Surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.1(g)_, each WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such Surrender the WPZ Common Units, together with any distributions with respect thereto, and any Fractional Unit Payment, as contemplated by this _Section 2.1_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Fractional Unit Payment. 

  

 (h) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged WMZ Common Units._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to WPZ Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder of any WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units not Surrendered with respect to WPZ Common Units issuable in respect thereof and no Fractional Unit Payment shall be paid to any such Holder until the Surrender of such WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units in accordance with this _Section 2.1_. 

   ##### 

  

    

Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, there shall be paid to the Holder of
each WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units, without interest, (i) at
the time of Surrender of any such WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common
Units, the amount of any Fractional Unit Payment to which such Holder is
entitled and the amount of dividends or other distributions previously
paid with respect to the whole WPZ Common Units issuable with respect to such
WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units that have a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the time of Surrender
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole WPZ Common Units with a
record date after the Effective Time and prior to such Surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such Surrender. 

  

 (i) _No Further Ownership Rights in WMZ Common Units._ All WPZ Common Units issued upon the Surrender for exchange of WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.1_ (including any Fractional Unit Payment) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the WMZ Common Units heretofore represented by such WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units (including all rights to common units arrearages), subject, however, to WPZs obligation, with respect to WMZ Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, to pay any distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by WMZ on such WMZ Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the Closing Date. 

  

 (j) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the Holders of the WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units for twelve months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to WPZ, upon demand, and any Holders of the WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.1_ shall thereafter look only to WPZ and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for WPZ Common Units, any Fractional Unit Payment and any distributions with respect to WMZ Common Units or WPZ Common Units to which such Holders may be entitled. 

  

 (k) _No Liability._ None of WPZ, WPZ General Partner, WMZ, WMZ General Partner or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any WPZ Common Units (or distributions with respect thereto) or Fractional Unit Payment properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units shall not have been Surrendered prior to such date on which any WPZ Common Units, any Fractional Unit Payment or any distributions with respect to WMZ Common Units or WPZ Common Units in respect of such WMZ Certificate or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such units, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such WMZ Certificates or Book-Entry WMZ Common Units shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of WPZ, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (l) _Withholding Rights._ WPZ shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to 

   ##### 

  

    

deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by WPZ,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by WPZ.

applicable, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, WPZ shall maintain officers and directors liability insurance covering each WMZ DandO Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior to the Effective Time was covered by the existing officers and directors liability insurance applicable to the WMZ Group Entities (" _D andO Insurance_") on terms substantially no less advantageous to the WMZ DandO Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that WPZ shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 200% of the current annual premium currently paid by the WMZ Group Entities for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount. Such insurance shall contain a "no rescission" endorsement or the substantive equivalent thereof. WPZ shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this _Section 5.11_.

 (b) distributions with respect to the General Partner Units and Incentive Distribution Rights so that, in respect of any fiscal quarter, the holders thereof receive a full distribution reflective of the portion of such fiscal quarter for which such interests were outstanding. 

   

 SECTION 5.13 _Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation_. The WMZ Parties hereby consent to the WPZ Group Entities use of and reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements, including the WMZ Financial Statements, relating to the WMZ Group Entities reasonably requested by the WPZ Parties to be used in any financing or other activities of the WPZ Parties, including any filings that the WPZ Parties desire to make with the 

   ##### 

  

    

SEC. In addition, the WMZ Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts, at
the WPZ Parties sole cost and expense, to obtain the consent of Ernst and
Young LLP to the inclusion of the financial statements referenced above in
appropriate filings with the SEC. Prior to the Closing, the WMZ Parties will
provide the WPZ Parties such information, and make available such personnel,
as the WPZ Parties may reasonably request in order to assist any of the WPZ
Group Entities in connection with financing activities, including any public
offerings to be registered under the Securities Act or private offerings.

unitholders without such further approval. No supplement, modification or
waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
party to be bound thereby. The failure of a party to exercise any right or
remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy
in the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless
of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided. 

  

 SECTION 9.4 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Except as provided in _Article II_ and _Section 5.11_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder. No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any attempted assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective. 

  

 SECTION 9.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 9.6 _Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one instrument.
