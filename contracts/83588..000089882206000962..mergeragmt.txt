     SECTION 3.01. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON COMPANY SECURITIES. At the Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company (other than the
requisite approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company in
accordance with the OGCL):

         (a) Each Company Common Share held in treasury and not outstanding and
each Company Common Share that is owned by Parent or MergerCo immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be
made with respect thereto.

         (b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time (other than Company Dissenting Shares and Company
Common Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(a)), shall be
converted and exchanged automatically into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to $40 per Company Common Share (the "COMPANY COMMON SHARE MERGER
CONSIDERATION"), payable to the holder thereof in accordance with Section 3.03.
The Company Common Shares that are to be so converted into the right to receive
the Company Common Share Merger Consideration are referred to herein as the
"MERGER SHARES".

         (c) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding
qualified or nonqualified option to purchase Company Common Shares ("COMPANY

or arrangement of the Company (collectively, "INCENTIVE PLANS"), shall become
fully vested and exercisable or payable, as the case may be (whether or not then
vested or subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied, and
regardless of the exercise price thereof). At the Merger Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i)
the Company Common Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per
share of such Company Stock Option, multipled by the total number of Company
Common Shares subject to such Company Stock Option (the "COMPANY OPTION
CONSIDERATION"), without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be

         (d) All restricted share awards, whether time-based or performance-
based ("COMPANY RESTRICTED SHARES"), granted pursuant to the Incentive Plans or
otherwise that remain unvested, automatically shall become fully vested and free
of any forfeiture or holding restrictions or performance or other conditions
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, (based on a deemed achievement
of performance awards at "target" level), and each Company Restricted Share
shall be considered an outstanding Company Common Share for all purposes of this
Agreement, including the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration.

         (e) At the Merger Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive Company Common Shares or benefits measured in whole or in
part by the value of a number of Company Common Shares granted under the
Incentive Plans or otherwise (including performance shares, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred stock units and dividend

(each, other than Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options, "COMPANY
STOCK-BASED AWARDS"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to represent a right
or award with respect to Company Common Shares, shall become fully vested and
free of any forfeiture or holding restrictions or performance or other
conditions (based on a deemed achievement of performance awards at "target"
level) and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, at the Merger Effective
Time, an amount in cash, calculated in accordance with such right or award,
based on the Company Common Share Merger Consideration in respect of each
Company Common Share underlying a particular Company Stock-Based Award less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.07 with
respect to such payment.

     SECTION 3.02. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON MERGERCO SECURITIES. At the Merger

MergerCo in accordance with the OGCL, which approval has been obtained), each
outstanding common share, no par value, of MergerCo issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable common share, no par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

         (a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint as paying
agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the

Services is satisfactory to it). Immediately following completion of the Merger
and the cancellation of the Company Stock Options, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Company
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares, Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Shares, and Company Stock-Based Awards, cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Company Consideration required to be paid

hereinafter referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION FUND"), and to cause the
Company Paying Agent to make, and the Company Paying Agent shall make, payments
of the Company Consideration out of the Surviving Corporation Fund to the
holders of Merger Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, and
Company Stock-Based Awards in accordance with this Agreement. The Surviving
Corporation Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all
principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's,
a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof, as directed
by and for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Merger
Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, and Company
Stock-Based Awards following completion of the Merger pursuant to this Article
III. Any and all interest and other income earned on the Surviving Corporation
Fund shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company Paying Agent to mail to
each person who was, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, a
holder of record of the Merger Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the certificates representing the Merger Shares (the
"COMPANY COMMON SHARE CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Company Common Share Certificates to the Company Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Company Common Share
Certificates in exchange for the Company Consideration. Upon surrender to the
Company Paying Agent of Company Common Share Certificates for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Company Common Share
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration in respect thereof, and the Company
Common Share Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Company Common Share Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Company Common Share Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration in respect
thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.03, each Company Common Share Certificate shall
be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Company Common Share Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III.

         (c) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund deposited with the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Merger Shares that become
Company Dissenting

                                       -14-

Shares shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration in respect of Company Common Shares
held by any shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall
have withdrawn or lost such shareholder's rights to appraisal of such shares
under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL ("SECTION 1701.85").

         (d) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Merger Shares for one year after the Merger

any holders of Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article
III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Surviving
Corporation Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto. None of Parent, the Company Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for any such shares (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

         (e) If any Company Common Share Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Common Share Certificate, the Company Paying Agent shall pay in respect
of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Common Share
Certificate relate the Company Common Share Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled.

         (f) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Share Certificates
representing Merger Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by Law.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall remain in full force and effect
until a date determined by the Company, which shall be no later than one month
prior to the Merger Effective Time (the "ESPP DATE"). As of the ESPP Date (i)
all amounts held under the ESPP shall be used to purchase Company Common Shares
as if the ESPP Date were a purchase date under the ESPP and (ii) all offering
and purchase periods pending under the ESPP shall be terminated and no new
offering or purchasing periods shall be commenced.

     SECTION 3.05. TERMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S DRIP. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to provide that as of no later than five business days prior
to the Closing Date

consummation of the Merger. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Merger
Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall
terminate the DRIP.

     SECTION 3.06. COMPANY DISSENTING SHARES.

         (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and
to the extent available under the OGCL, Company Common Shares that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held by
any shareholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for
such shares (the "COMPANY DISSENTING SHARES") pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 1701.85 shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration. Any such shareholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment
of the fair cash value of such shareholder's Company Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.85; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all
Company Dissenting Shares held by any shareholder who shall have failed to
perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn, in accordance with Section
1701.85, or lost such shareholder's rights to appraisal of such shares under
Section 1701.85 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to
have become exchangeable for, as of the Merger Effective Time, the right to
receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares in the manner provided in Section 3.03(a) or, if a portion
of the Surviving Corporation Fund deposited with the Company Paying Agent to pay

and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options,
Company Stock-Based Awards, or

                                       -16-

any filings required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE"), and (E) the filing of the appropriate merger documents as
required by the OGCL, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications
would not, individually or in the aggregate, (A) prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.06. PERMITS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

         (a) The Company and Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
registrations, franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, consents,
certificates, approvals, other regulatory authorizations and orders of any
Governmental Authority necessary for them to own, lease and operate their
properties or to carry on their business as it is now being conducted
(collectively, the "PERMITS"), and all such Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, except where the failure to obtain and maintain the Permits, or the
suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.06 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any
Laws or Permits applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or by which

Permits applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) a violation
of any Laws applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except, in each
case, for any such violation, breach, default, revocation or termination which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or inquiry by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case with respect to any
alleged or claimed violation of Law applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, in each case, for any such
investigation or inquiry which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.07. SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

         (a) Except as set forth on Section 4.07(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has timely filed all forms, reports and documents
(including all exhibits) required to be filed by it with the SEC (the "COMPANY
SEC REPORTS") since July 1, 2004. The Company SEC Reports, including any
financial statements or schedules included in the Company SEC Reports, each as
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) complied in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (ii) did not, when filed as amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the

         (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports, each as amended,
was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and each
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows (and changes in shareholders equity, if
any) of the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein except
as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year end adjustments). None of the Company Subsidiaries is
subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required
to file any form, report or other document with the SEC or the NYSE.

         (c) The Company has devised and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company (1) has designed
disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that information material to the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole relating to it and any of its
subsidiaries is made known to the management of the Company by others within the
Company or any of its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company SEC Reports and (2) has disclosed based
upon the most recent evaluation completed on June 8, 2006 to its auditors and
the audit committee of its Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in
any material respect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have disclosed to its auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal
controls and the Company has provided to Parent copies of any such disclosure in
(A) or (B), except to the extent provided by privilege.

         (d) Since June 8, 2006 through the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of the Company, (x) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
nor any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has

                                       -22-

<PAGE>

received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge since then of any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
the Company or any of its subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices or has a "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" (as
such terms are defined in the Public Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing
Standard No. 2, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting, and (y) no attorney representing the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or
any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any
committee thereof or to the General Counsel or Chief Executive Officer of the
Company.

         (e) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of
the NYSE that are applicable to the Company. The Company's auditors and chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have given all certifications,
attestations and reports required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

         (f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities
of any nature (whether known or unknown, accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due), except liabilities that (i) are
accrued or reserved against in the Balance Sheet or are reflected in the notes
thereto, (ii) were incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since the date of such financial statements, or (iii) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.08. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as set forth in
Section 4.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since March 31, 2006, (a) the
Company has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice and (b) there has not been any change, event, fact, development,
occurrence, effect or circumstance that has resulted or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.09. ABSENCE OF LITIGATION. Except (i) as listed in Section 4.09
of the Company Disclosure Schedule or (ii) with respect to litigation that may
be commenced after the date of this Agreement in connection with the Merger,
there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
properties or assets except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, (x)
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is or are subject to
any order, judgment, writ, injunction or decree, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         (a) Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
material employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all material
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all material
employment, termination, severance or other contracts or agreements to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, with respect to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or which are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than any such benefit plans,
programs, arrangements, contracts or agreements maintained outside of the United
States primarily for the benefit of current or former employees, officers,
directors or consultants of the Company or any Company Subsidiary working
outside of the United States or who worked outside of the United States (such
plans hereinafter being referred to as "NON-U.S. PLANS") (collectively, the
"U.S. PLANS"). The Company has made available to Parent copies, which are
correct and complete in all material respects, of the following: (i) the U.S.
Plans and any amendments thereto, (ii) the annual report (Form 5500) filed with
the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the last two plan years, (iii) the most
recently received IRS determination letter, if any, relating to a U.S. Plan,
(iv) the most recently prepared actuarial report or financial statement, if any,
relating to a U.S. Plan, (v) the most recent summary plan description for such
U.S. Plan (or other descriptions of such U.S. Plan provided to employees) and
all material modifications thereto, and (vi) any related trust or other funding
vehicle. With respect to the U.S. Plans and Non-U.S. Plans, no event has
occurred, and, to the Company's knowledge, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, under ERISA,
the Code or any other Applicable Laws. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, result in an increase in liabilities or obligations that would be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, neither
the Company, nor any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
any other Person, has any express commitment, whether legally enforceable or
not, to modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code, or any other
Applicable Law or administrative changes that do not increase the liabilities or
obligations under any such plan.

         (b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
any material liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, each U.S. Plan has been operated in all respects in accordance with its
terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in any material
liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, there
are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with,
any U.S. Plan, and no Action is pending or anticipated or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course) with respect to any such claim or dispute.

                                       -24-

<PAGE>

         (c) Each U.S. Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, or is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
issued by the IRS, and to the knowledge of the Company no fact or event has
occurred since the date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such U.S. Plan or the exempt status
of any such trust that would, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
material liability for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

         (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary sponsors or has
sponsored any U.S. Plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement
health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 4.10(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, to the best knowledge of the Company, no written
communication has been made that would prevent the Company or any Company
Subsidiary from amending or terminating any U.S. Plan providing health or
medical benefits in respect of any retired, former or current employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

         (e) Full payment has been made, or otherwise properly accrued on the
books and records of the Company and any Company Subsidiary, of all amounts that
the Company and any Company Subsidiary are required under the terms of the U.S.
Plans to have paid as contributions to such Plans on or prior to the date of
this Agreement (excluding any amounts not yet due).

         (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no U.S. Plan, either individually or collectively, provides for any
payment by the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would constitute a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (g) Section 4.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each U.S.
Plan (or United-States based pension plan in the case of an ERISA Affiliate)
sponsored by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code (each, a "TITLE IV
PLAN"), and with respect to each Title IV Plan, except as would not individually
or in the aggregate result in any material liability for the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the date of this Agreement: (i)
there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, (ii) no reportable event within
the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived has occurred, (iii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in full, (iv) no
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan, and (v) the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan.

         (h) For purposes of this Section 4.10, an entity is an "ERISA
AFFILIATE" of the Company if it would have ever been considered a single
employer with the Company under

                                       -25-

<PAGE>

4001(b) of ERISA or part of the same controlled group as the Company for
purposes of Section 302(d)(8)(C) of ERISA.

         (i) SCHEDULE 4.10(I) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list
of each material Non-U.S. Plan. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.10(I) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, or as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
result in a material liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, each Non-U.S. Plan complies in all respects with applicable Laws.
With respect to each Non-U.S. Plan, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in any material liability to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (i) all employer and employee contributions to
each Non-U.S. Plan required by applicable Laws or by the terms of such Non-U.S.
Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with GAAP; (ii)
the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Plan, the liability
of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Plan funded through insurance or the book
reserve established for any Non-U.S. Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the date of this Agreement with respect to all current and
former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Non-U.S. Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such
assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; (iii)
each Non-U.S. Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. As of the
date of this Agreement, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
anticipated or threatened material litigation relating to any Non-U.S. Plan; and
(iv) any and all amounts required to be accrued with respect to any Non-U.S.
Plan or pursuant to any statutory requirements pertaining to employee benefits,
mandatory contributions, retirement plans or similar benefits, have been accrued
in accordance with GAAP, including accruals relating to any severance,
termination pay or profit sharing benefits.

         (j) No Title IV Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in
section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described in section
4063(a) of ERISA.

         (k) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and except as provided in this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or
officer of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment or funding of any payment, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee or officer, or (iii) limit the ability to amend or terminate any Plan.

         (l) All Company Stock Options have been granted with an exercise price
per share no lower than the "fair market value" (as defined in the applicable
plan) of one Class A Common Share on the date of the corporate action
effectuating the grant.

     SECTION 4.11. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. The information supplied by the Company
relating to the Company and Company Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy
Statement or any other document to be filed with the SEC in connection herewith

it is first mailed to the Company's shareholders or at the time of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting or at the time of any

<PAGE>

amendment or supplement thereto, or, in the case of any Other Filing, at the
date it is first mailed to the Company's shareholders or at the date it is first
filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, except that no representation is made (or omitted to be
made) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
MergerCo in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement or the Other
Filings for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. All documents that
the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will comply as
to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

     SECTION 4.12. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

         (a) Schedule 4.12(a) sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
all U.S. and foreign (i) issued Patents and Patent applications, (ii) Trademark

years any, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by any
Person alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any

Subsidiaries which, either individually or in the aggregate, are material. The
conduct of the business (including the products and services) of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries does not materially infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any material Intellectual Property rights of any Person, nor,
to the knowledge of the Company, does there exist a substantial basis for any
claim therefor.

         (d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any claim
in the past two (2) years of a material infringement, misappropriation or other
violation by any other Person of the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's
rights to Company Intellectual Property, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no Person is materially infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any
Company Owned Intellectual Property.

         (f) To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no material
security breaches in the Company's or any of the Company Subsidiaries' internal
information technology systems or external information technology systems hosted

         (g) No claims have been asserted against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the past two (2) years alleging a
violation of an applicable Law in connection with a violation of any Person's
privacy or personal information rights, nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
does there exist a substantial basis for any material claim therefore. To the
knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not materially breach or otherwise cause any material violation of
any applicable Law in connection with privacy, data protection, or the
collection and use of personal information collected, used, or held for use by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the conduct of their respective
businesses. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries take commercially
reasonable measures consistent with industry standard practices of the computer
software and information technology industry to ensure that such personal
information is protected against unauthorized access, use, modification, or
other misuse.

         (h) Each consultant or contractor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that has developed, modified, improved, or contributed to any
material Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has assigned all of its Intellectual Property rights in such development,
modification, improvement, or contribution to such Company or Company
Subsidiary.

or any Company Subsidiary has, nor will have, after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, any valid and enforceable claim, right or
interest of ownership under applicable Law to or in any material Intellectual
Property of the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

         (j) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries take commercially
reasonable measures according to industry standards in the computer software and
information technology industry to protect the confidentiality of Trade Secrets
included in the material Company Intellectual Property, including requiring all
Persons having access thereto to execute written non-disclosure agreements.

         (k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a member of, or
contributor of Intellectual Property to, any industry standards body or similar
organization such that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is obligated to
offer or grant for (i) free or nominal value or (ii) except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, less than fair market value, to any other Person any license or
right to any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

make available any source code included in Company Owned Software to any escrow
agent or any other Person, and (B) no event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that has resulted in, or to the knowledge of the Company will,

with, appropriate written non-disclosure agreements.

         (m) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement

loss or impairment of or payment of any additional material amounts with respect
to the Company's right to own, use, or hold for use any of the material
Intellectual Property as owned, used or held for use in the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted, or (B) give any Person the right or option to
cause or declare the release, disclosure or delivery of any Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary by or to any escrow
agent or other Person.

on the part of Parent or MergerCo, and to the knowledge of Parent, any other
parties thereto, under the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this

otherwise be made available to Parent or MergerCo on the Closing Date. Parent
will provide to the Company any amendments to the Equity Funding Letter and the

provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries other than such employees covered by
collective bargaining agreements ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES") (i) compensation
(including base salary and cash bonuses (comparable in terms of achievability)
under the Company's annual cash bonus plan, but excluding any equity based

<PAGE>

and the Company Subsidiaries' obligations under, the severance plans listed on
Section 7.04(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule without any amendment or
change that is adverse to the Company Employees. During the Benefits
Continuation Period, severance benefits offered to Company Employees shall be
determined without taking into account any reduction after the Merger Effective
Time in compensation paid to Company Employees and used to determine severance
benefits.

         (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Merger Effective Time (the "NEW PLANS"), each Company Employee shall subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Merger Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Merger Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time; PROVIDED, that the foregoing
shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication
of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans,
collectively, the "OLD PLANS"), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee,
Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable plans of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

         (c) Parent shall continue or cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue retiree life insurance benefits for former employees (as of the Closing
Date) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries who participate in retiree life
insurance plans of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time to remain in effect from and after the
Closing Date for a period of one year without adverse change to such former
employees. Parent shall continue or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue retiree health benefits (including medical prescription drugs) for
former employees (as of the Closing Date) of the Company or Company Subsidiaries
who participate in retiree health benefit programs of the Company or its
subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, to remain in
effect without adverse change to such former employees for a period of at least
one year following the Merger Effective Time; PROVIDED, that Parent may allocate




                                      -48-
<PAGE>

additional costs to participants in the event the actual costs of such retiree
health benefits exceed the actuarial costs projected under FAS 106. For Company
Employees, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent agrees
to continue or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue the Company's retiree
welfare programs, including medical prescription drugs and retiree life
insurance program (the "COMPANY RETIREE WELFARE PROGRAMS") on terms and
conditions substantially equivalent in duration, scope, value, participant cost,
vesting and otherwise to those in effect as of the Merger Effective Time with
respect to all Company Employees who as of immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time would be eligible to receive benefits under the Company Retiree
Welfare Programs.

         (d) All annual bonus plans for Company Employees for fiscal 2006 will
be continued in accordance with their terms, PROVIDED, that the bonus plans for
fiscal 2006 shall be calculated without taking into account any expenses or
costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any expenses or costs related to restructurings
undertaken in anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
or any non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been
incurred had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, and
bonus amounts for the 2006 fiscal year shall be determined based on the
Company's actual performance and in accordance with past practice, PROVIDED,
that such bonus amounts in the aggregate shall, not be less than $14.0 million,
but in no event shall exceed $16.5 million and, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that such
amounts shall be determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board
prior to Closing. The Company shall pay the bonus amounts for the 2006 fiscal
year following the determination contemplated by the immediately preceding
sentence and prior to the Closing.

         (e) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company to establish
a special equity replacement bonus plan for fiscal 2007 (the "EQUITY REPLACEMENT
PLAN") which shall be (i) in addition to the cash bonuses contemplated by
Section 7.04(a), (ii) in lieu of equity compensation historically granted to
Company Employees, and (iii) based upon targets and goals that are comparable in
terms of achievability to those targets and goals pertaining to equity
compensation granted to Company Employees in fiscal 2006 and scheduled to vest
during such fiscal year. The amounts payable in respect of the Equity
Replacement Plan, assuming performance at target levels shall not be less than
$5.5 million in the aggregate.

         (f) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of
the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder ("SECTION 16") of Company Common Shares or Company Stock
Options to acquire Company Common Shares (or Company Common Shares acquired upon
the vesting of any Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Restricted Shares)
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16.

         (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any
period of time for, or preclude the ability of either Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Company Employee for any reason or (ii) subject to
the limitations and requirements specifically set forth



                                      -49-
<PAGE>

in this Section 7.04, require either Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue any Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Merger Effective Time.

         (h) Prior to the Merger Effective Date, the Company shall amend each of
the Company Retirement Plan and the Company Supplemental Retirement Plan to
provide that no additional benefits in respect of any Company Employee shall
accrue under each such plan after the date of the applicable amendment.

     SECTION 7.05. DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE OF THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION.

         (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or this
Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of
any of the Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Merger Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is at the date of this Agreement or during the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Closing Date serving as a director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or Company Subsidiaries or
as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") to
the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or
hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such
judgments, fines, penalties or, with the consent of Parent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, any
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such
Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of
any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without
the requirement of any bond or other security; PROVIDED that all advancement of
expenses pursuant to the foregoing shall be subject to an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification from the Surviving Corporation. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
7.05(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Merger
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection
therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and
advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who continues to
be or who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or
fiduciary of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries after the date of this
Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of such person's heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this Section 7.05(a): (A) the
term "CLAIM" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit
or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or



                                      -50-
<PAGE>

any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to
the institution of any such Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to
matters that relate to such Indemnified Party's duties or service as a director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing or any other person at
or prior to the Merger Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of
Company Subsidiaries; and (B) the term "EXPENSES" means reasonable attorneys'
fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including,
without limitation, experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection
with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section
7.05(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or
advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume control of and the defense of any
Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of which this
Section 7.05 applied. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened
claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of
which indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless
such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, demand,
Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerCo agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as provided in the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws,
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other
organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and indemnification
agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries identified on
Section 7.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Merger
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

         (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Merger
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, were directors,
officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of
Company Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required by Law and then
only to the minimum extent required by Law.



                                      -51-
<PAGE>

         (d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least
six (6) years the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Merger
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, that (i) that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured, PROVIDED, that such substitution shall not result
in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the
Merger Effective Time; (ii) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.05(d) more than an amount per year
of coverage equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would
be required to expend more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current
annual premiums paid by the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the
maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal
to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
successors or assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

         (e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving limited liability company, partnership or
other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

         (f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.05 and the parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the
Surviving Corporation's obligations pursuant to this Section 7.05.

         (g) This Section 7.05 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and
to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 7.05.

     SECTION 7.06. FINANCING.

         (a) Each of Parent and MergerCo shall use, and shall cause their
Affiliates to use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into the definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein
and (ii) to satisfy (or cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all
conditions, and otherwise comply with all terms, applicable to the Buyer Parties
(or their Affiliates) in such definitive agreements. In the event any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Financing Commitments, Parent and MergerCo shall promptly notify the



                                      -52-
<PAGE>

Company and shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any
such portion from alternative sources as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Parent and MergerCo with any portion of the Financing.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party
to the Financing Commitments or any termination of the Financing Commitments.
Each of Parent and MergerCo shall refrain (and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly,
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of
the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in any definitive
agreement related to the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Parent and MergerCo may agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing and may obtain financing in substitution of
all or a portion of the Financing, so long as they consult with the Company and
promptly provide the Company with such information it may reasonably request
regarding any alternative financing arrangements or plans. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Financing (or any alternative) has not been obtained by the
Outside Date, the Buyer Parties shall continue to be obligated to consummate the
Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of
this Agreement and to Parent's right under Section 9.01, regardless of whether
the Buyer Parties have complied with all of their obligations under this
Agreement (including their obligations under this Section 7.06).

         (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that none of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee
or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Such cooperation by the Company shall include, at the reasonable
request of Parent and if necessary to obtain the Financing or obtain any portion
thereof from alternative sources pursuant to subsection (a) above, (i) agreeing
to use reasonable best efforts to enter into such agreements, and to use
reasonable best efforts to deliver such officer's certificates and opinions, as
are customary in financings of such type and as are, in the good faith
determination of the persons executing such officer's certificates or opinions,
accurate, and reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and the
granting of corporate guarantees to the extent required and customary for
financings of this type, PROVIDED, that no obligation of the Company under any
such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the Merger Effective
Time, (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers to be
reasonably available to (A) participate in meetings, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions
with rating agencies, (B) prepare or participate in the preparation of business
projections and financial statements for inclusion in offering memoranda,
private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents customarily
included in documents of this type, (iii) using its reasonable best efforts to
cause its independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Parent
consistent with their customary practice (including to provide consent to Parent
to prepare and use their



                                      -53-
<PAGE>

audit reports relating to the Company and any necessary "comfort letters" in
each case on customary terms and consistent with their customary practice in
connection with the Financing) and (iv) providing to the contemplated sources of
the Debt and Equity Financing financial and other information in the Company's
possession with respect to the Merger reasonably requested and customary in
connection with financings of such type. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, reimburse the Company for any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. The Buyer Parties shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its subsidiaries from and against all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith; provided
however, that the foregoing (1) shall not apply to the Company's or its
subsidiaries' or other Representatives' willful misconduct or gross negligence
and (2) shall be void and of no further force and effect from and after the
Merger Effective Time.

     SECTION 7.07. FURTHER ACTION; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to,
and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) days after the date of this Agreement (unless
extended by mutual agreement of the parties) make their respective filings and
thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether
any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations,
waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any third parties or
other Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to offer
to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action
as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under



                                      -54-
<PAGE>

Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as expeditiously possible
(and in any event shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to
occur by February 15, 2007), including, without limitation (A) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its
subsidiaries and (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after
the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its subsidiaries'
(including the Surviving Corporation's) or affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiaries'
(including the Surviving Corporation's) businesses, product lines or assets, in
each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this Section
7.07(b)(iii) shall require or be construed to require any of Parent or the
Company to take any action, propose or make any divestiture or other
undertaking, or propose or enter into any consent decree, except for those that
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
benefits that are expected to be derived from the Merger and the other
transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) subject to
applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority,
keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications between the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, and any Third Party
and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to such transactions. The Company
and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Authority. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate.

         (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 7.07, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), each of
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
7.07 shall limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(b) or 9.01(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination,
complied with its obligations under this Section 7.07.



                                      -55-

         (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "REGULATORY LAW" means the Sherman
Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
Laws, including without limitation any antitrust, competition or trade

regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of

promote diversity of media ownership or (iii) protect the national security or
the national economy of any nation.

     SECTION 7.08. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The parties hereto agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger shall be issued by a party without consulting with the
other parties and providing such parties reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, except as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other parties
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release
announcing the Merger and the execution of this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.09. THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. The Company shall use reasonable
efforts, to the extent requested by Parent, to obtain and deliver to Parent at
or prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under each Company
Material Contract set forth on Section 7.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
using a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. Unless specifically stated
otherwise, "reasonable efforts" as used in this Agreement shall not require any
party to expend any funds, other than customary fees and expenses, such as
filing fees.

     SECTION 7.10. Notification. Each of the Company and Parent, as the case may
be, shall act in good faith to reasonably promptly notify the other party upon
becoming aware of any occurrence or event that is reasonably likely to cause any
of the conditions to closing set forth in Article VIII not to be satisfied.

     SECTION 7.11. STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. The Company shall promptly advise
Parent orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company
or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding
any such stockholder litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation, shall give consideration to Parent's advice with respect
to such stockholder litigation and, prior to the termination of this Agreement,
shall not settle any such litigation without Parent's prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have taken
an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-appealable and
has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger ("GOVERNMENTAL ORDER");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the terms of this Section 9.01(c) shall not be available
to any party unless such party shall have used its reasonable efforts to oppose
any such Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or made

its covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set forth in Section
8.02(b) would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date;

under this Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
Parent and MergerCo herein are or become untrue or inaccurate such that the

agreements herein such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.03(b) would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date; or (iii) the conditions set
forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 have been satisfied (other than the
condition set forth in Section 8.02(c) of this Agreement) but Parent has failed
to obtain the Financing by the later of: (1) November 16, 2006 and (2) 10
Business Days following the date that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01
and 8.02 (other than the condition set forth in Section 8.02(c) of this
Agreement) are satisfied;

         (f) by the Company or Parent if the Company Shareholder Approval is not
obtained at the Company Shareholders' Meeting (including any adjournments and
postponements thereof); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.01(f) shall not be available to the Company where
the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval is caused by any action
or failure to act of the Company that constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement;

the provisions of Section 7.03 or (B) failed to use reasonable best efforts to

Company Shareholder Approval, and such failure shall have been a material breach
of Section 7.01, (6) a tender or exchange offer relating to equity securities of
the Company shall have been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, and
the Company shall not have sent to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Securities Act, within 10 (ten) Business Days after such
tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement
disclosing that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer or (7) the Company Board fails to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent requests in writing
that such recommendation be reaffirmed;

         (h) by the Company, if the Company Board has approved, or authorized
the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to, a Company
Superior Proposal, but only so long as (i) the Company Shareholder Approval has
not yet been obtained, (ii) the Company is in compliance in all material
respects with Section 7.03 (including informing Parent of the material terms and
conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such Company Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company shall have first given
Parent at least four (4) Business Days' notice of its intent to terminate
pursuant to this subsection, (iv) after taking into account any amendment to
this Agreement entered into, or to which Parent irrevocably covenants to enter
into, within such three (3) Business Day period and for which all internal
approvals of Parent have been obtained since receipt of such notice, such
Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
(taking into account any amendment to this Agreement or amendment to this
Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent), (v) the Company pays to Parent the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.03 concurrently with or prior to
such termination and (vi) the Company intends, simultaneously or

party hereto except that the Guaranty referred to in Section 5.07 and the
provisions of Sections 7.02(b), this Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Article X
shall survive any such termination); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, except as provided in
Section 9.03(e) and 9.03(f) of this Agreement, that nothing herein shall relieve

warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination.

     reason in circumstances where Parent had the right to terminate this
     Agreement at or prior to such time pursuant to Section 9.01(g) provided
     that if such termination was not pursuant to Section 9.01(g) but the sole
     basis on which Parent is entitled to the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
     this Section 9.03(b)(i)(A) is by reason of Section 9.01(g)(5) then Parent
     shall be entitled to such fee only if it has given the Company, within
     three Business Days, notice of its belief that it had such termination
     right after becoming aware of the facts giving rise thereto) or (B) by the
     Company pursuant to Section 9.01(h), the Company shall pay to Parent the

     received a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, and
     in the case of Section 9.01(f) such Company Acquisition Proposal shall have
     been publicly disclosed prior to such time, then the Company shall pay to
     Parent (A) 25% of the Termination Fee upon termination of this Agreement,
     and (B) if within 12 months following the Termination Date, the Company

     any Company Acquisition Proposal, whichever occurs first (and for purposes
     of this Section 9.03(b)(ii), "50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in each
     occurrence of "20%" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal).

         (d) Except as set forth in Section 9.01(h), the Termination Fee shall
be paid by the Company as directed by Parent in writing in immediately available
funds within three (3) Business Days following the date of the event giving rise

             (i) by the Company (1) pursuant to Section 9.01(e)(iii) of this

     the Financing not being available at such time and where the conditions set
     forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 (other than the condition set forth in
     Section 8.02(c) of this Agreement) are satisfied (other than under
     circumstances where (A) Parent is in breach of its obligations under the
     Financing Commitments or (B) Parent is in breach of its obligations under
     Section 7.06 of this Agreement or (C) the Financing is available but the
     Closing Cash is not available for use to make payments set forth in Section
     5.08(a) or (D) the representations and warranties of Parent contained in
     Section 5.08(b) are untrue or incorrect as of the date of this Agreement
     and, in the case of clauses (A), (B) and (D), such breach or failure was a
     material contributing factor in Parent failing to obtain the Financing (any
     such occurrences set forth in clauses (A) through (D), a "PARENT FINANCING
     BREACH")), then Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business
     Days of such termination $81,000,000 (the "SELLER EXPENSE FEE").
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (1) in the case of this
     subsection (e)(i), payment of the Seller Expense Fee and (2) in the case of
     subsection (e)(ii) below, payment of the Seller Expense Fee plus damages in
     any amount incurred by the Company (or which may pursuant to Section 10.08
     be asserted by the Company on behalf of its shareholders) in an amount not
     to exceed the excess of the Damages Cap over the Seller Expense Fee (but
     subject to Section 10.07 in the case of subsection (e)(ii)), shall be the
     sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, any of its Affiliates and its
     shareholders pursuant to this Agreement for breach hereof and none of
     Parent or MergerCo or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
     other liability or obligation of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out
     of the termination of this Agreement, any breach of this Agreement by
     Parent or MergerCo (other than a breach of any of Parent's post-closing
     obligations under this Agreement), any Parent Financing Breach or the
     failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
     consummated, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, other than for
     fraud; or

             (ii) by the Company (1) pursuant to Section 9.01(e)(iii) of this
     Agreement or (2) pursuant to Section 9.01(b) of this Agreement by reason of
     the Financing not being available at such time and where the conditions set
     forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 (other than the condition set forth in
     Section 8.02(c) of this Agreement are satisfied (under circumstances where
     a Parent Financing Breach has occurred), then Parent shall pay to the
     Company within three (3) Business Days of such termination the Seller
     Expense Fee. In addition, Parent shall be liable to the Company for any
     damages incurred by the Company in connection with a Parent Financing
     Breach, but in no event shall Parent, MergerCo or any of their respective
     Affiliates be liable in connection with



                                      -62-
<PAGE>

     this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in an amount in
     excess of $270,000,000 (the "DAMAGES CAP") in the aggregate minus any
     amounts paid by Parent pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
     9.03(e)(ii) of this Agreement, other than for fraud.

         (f) In any event not covered in Section 9.03(e)(i) or 9.03(e)(ii) of
this Agreement, and where the Merger has not been consummated, each party hereto
shall be liable in damages for any breach by it of this Agreement prior to
termination, except that the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Parent and its Affiliates, on the other, shall in no event be liable in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in an
aggregate amount in excess of $270,000,000, other than for fraud, and the
payment of such damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such party,
any of its Affiliates and its shareholders, pursuant to this Agreement for
breach hereof and none of the parties hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any other liability or obligation of any kind or nature
whatsoever arising out of the termination of this Agreement, any breach of this
Agreement by any of the parties hereto (other than a breach of any of Parent's
post-closing obligations under this Agreement), any Parent Financing Breach or
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise. The parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in Section 9.03(e)(ii) or in this Section
9.03(f) shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under
Section 10.07.

         (g) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 9.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay
the Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Seller Expense Fee
when due, and the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the
other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued
by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.03. If
payable, none of the Termination Fee or Seller Expense Fee shall be payable more
that once pursuant to this Agreement; PROVIDED, that the payment of 25% of the
Termination Fee followed by 75% of the Termination Fee shall not be prohibited
by the foregoing.

     SECTION 9.04. WAIVER. At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and MergerCo, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and
(c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition to
its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or Parent
(on behalf of Parent and MergerCo). The failure of any party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a
merger, by operation of law or otherwise).

     SECTION 10.06. PERFORMANCE GUARANTY. Parent hereby guarantees the due,
prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of
the obligations covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of each of the
MergerCo under this agreement in accordance with the terms hereof including any
such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are
required to be performed discharged or complied with following the Merger
Effective Time.

     SECTION 10.07. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any
breach of this Agreement, and accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity; provided, that the Company shall not be entitled to specific
performance (x) in the circumstances where Section 9.03(e)(i) applies or (y) the

restrictions on the operation of business, capital structure, financial and
ratio tests or the equity ownership of Parent or the Company from those set
forth in the Financing Commitments.

     SECTION 10.08. PARTIES IN INTEREST. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement, other than (a) following the consummation of the Merger, the
provisions of Article II and Section 7.05 (which are intended to be for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby or the persons entitled to payment
thereunder and may be enforced by such persons); and (b) the right of the
Company, on behalf of its shareholders, to pursue, but subject to the dollar
limitations set forth in Section 9.03(e) and 9.03(f),damages suffered by its
shareholders as a group in the event of Parent's or MergerCo's breach of this
Agreement or fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and
MergerCo.

     SECTION 10.09. GOVERNING LAW; FORUM.

         (a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to its rules of
conflict of laws.

         (b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Ohio or any court of the
United States located in the State of Ohio (the "OHIO COURTS") for any
litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in
such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation
in the Ohio Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Ohio Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of
the parties hereto agrees, (i) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject
to service of process in the State of Ohio, to appoint and maintain an agent in
the State of Ohio as such party's agent for acceptance of legal process, and
(ii) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified
mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal
Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (i) or
(ii) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of Ohio. In the event any party hereto fails
to notify any other party hereto, of its agent for service of process in the
State of Ohio, nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of
any party hereto to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence
legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party hereto in any
other jurisdiction to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or
proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 10.09.

     SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly
or otherwise, that



                                      -66-
<PAGE>

such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 10.10.

     SECTION 10.11. HEADINGS. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.12. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

     SECTION 10.13. WAIVER. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other
provision hereunder.
