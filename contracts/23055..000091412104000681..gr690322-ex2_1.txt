                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 12, 2004 (as
amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, this "Agreement"), by and
among Pitney Bowes Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Germanium
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Group 1 Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - -

            WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company have each determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as hereinafter defined), are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective
stockholders;

            WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted
resolutions approving the acquisition of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and has
agreed to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

            WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a
condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, a certain
stockholder of the Company is entering into a Voting Agreement, a copy of which
is attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreement"), providing for, among
other things, the agreement of such stockholder to vote his Shares (as
hereinafter defined), and an irrevocable proxy to vote his Shares, in each case
in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the
Special Meeting;

            WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in Section 8.1; and

            WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

            NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER
                                   ----------

            SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation Law"), Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with
this Agreement and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
The Company shall be the successor or the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Company and Merger Sub
are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as the "Constituent
Corporations."

            SECTION 1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have terminated and
the transactions contemplated in the Agreement shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place (a) at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, 1285
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. on the second (2nd)
Business Day after the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement or (b) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

            SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, the parties hereto will cause a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") to be signed, acknowledged and delivered for filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
Corporation Law. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or such other subsequent date or time as shall be agreed upon
by the parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger and in accordance with
the Corporation Law (the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to
herein as the "Effective Time").

            SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the Corporation Law, including Section 259 of the Corporation Law.

            SECTION 1.5 The Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth in
Exhibit B attached hereto, until duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

            SECTION 1.6 The By-Laws. The by-laws of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended at the Effective Time
to read in their entirety as the by-laws of Merger Sub then read and shall, as
so amended, from and after the Effective Time, be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

            SECTION 1.7 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective
Time, the officers of the Company shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation and the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective death, permanent
disability, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified all in accordance with applicable Law.

            SECTION 1.8 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or
desirable (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation, title to and possession of any property or right of
either Constituent Corporation acquired or to be acquired by reason of, or as a
result of, the Merger, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each Constituent Corporation hereby grants to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to do all acts necessary or proper
to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such property or rights
in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
fully authorized in the name of either Constituent Corporation to take any and
all such action.

                                   ARTICLE II

                     EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES
                            ------------------------

            SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock of the Company. At the Effective
Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any capital stock of the Company:

                  (a) Merger Consideration. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.50 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), including the
associated rights ("Rights") to purchase shares of Common Stock, issued pursuant
to the Company Rights Plan (the Common Stock together with the Rights are
hereinafter referred to each as a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof into the right to receive
and become exchangeable for TWENTY-THREE UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($23.00) in cash
(the "Merger Consideration"), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
certificates representing such shares of Common Stock as provided in Section
2.3. The amount of the Merger Consideration shall be subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 2.6.

                  (b) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding
and owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary or affiliate of Parent
or Merger Sub or Shares that are owned by the Company and in each case not held
on behalf of third parties (collectively, "Excluded Shares") immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of such Excluded Share, no longer be outstanding, shall
be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist.

            SECTION 2.2 Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

            SECTION 2.3 Payment for Shares.

                  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause
Merger Sub to make available to a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") sufficient funds to
make the payments pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof on a timely basis to holders
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) of Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall make the
payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this
Agreement. Parent shall pay all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

                  (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
but in no event later than 10 Business Days thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder (other
than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates), as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
(the "Certificates"), a form of letter of transmittal (each a "Letter of
Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and customary instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificate and receiving payment therefor.
Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such
Letter of Transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
promptly be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding tax as specified in Section 2.7 hereof) equal to the
product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by
the Merger Consideration, and each such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment (A) pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (B)
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(b), each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by
the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate.

                  (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will deliver in exchange for such affidavit, the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate.

                  (d) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. Any portion of the
Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be repaid to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company
who have not complied with this Section 2.3(d) hereof prior to the end of such
six (6) month period shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law) but only as general creditors thereof
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Neither Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent, shall be liable to any holder of
Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

            SECTION 2.4 Existing Stock Options; Warrants.

                  (a) Except to the extent set forth in Section 2.4(a) of the
Disclosure Letter, which options shall be cancelled by the Company upon the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable actions to ensure that
each option or right to acquire Shares (the "Existing Stock Options") granted
under any stock option or similar plan of the Company or under any agreement to
which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party (the "Stock Option Plans") which
is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or
vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and represent only the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each Share subject
thereto equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise or purchase price of such Existing Stock Option. Except to the
extent set forth in Section 2.4(a) of the Disclosure Letter, on the Effective
Time, each holder of an Existing Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in
full satisfaction of such Existing Stock Option, an amount in cash without
interest in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price of such
Existing Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Existing
Stock Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Option
Consideration") and each Existing Stock Option (including those Existing Stock
Options set forth on Section 2.4(a) of the Disclosure Letter) shall be canceled
upon payment to the Option holder of the Option Consideration reduced by any
income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such Existing Stock Option. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary consents or releases from holders of Existing Stock Options under the
Stock Option Plans and take all such other lawful action as may be necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4(a). The Company
shall take all reasonable actions to ensure (i) that the Stock Option Plans
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii) that following the Effective
Time no participant in the Stock Option Plans or other plans, programs or
arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. All administrative
and other rights and authorities granted under any Stock Option Plan to the
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any Committee or designee
thereof, shall, following the Effective Time, reside with the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (b) The Company shall take all reasonable actions required to
qualify for the exemption contemplated by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act for
the treatment of the Existing Stock Options contemplated hereby, including, if
necessary or appropriate, obtaining the approval of the Company's Board of
Directors, of the type described in a pertinent SEC no-action letter dated
January 12, 1999.

                  (c) Each warrant to acquire Shares (the "Existing Warrants")
granted under any warrant or similar agreement set forth in Section 2.4(c) of
the Disclosure Letter to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party which is
outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company
or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall represent only the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each Share subject
thereto equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Existing Warrant. On and after the date hereof, the
Company shall grant no additional warrants. After the Effective Time, following
delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as
may be reasonably required by the Company or the Paying Agent, each holder of an
Existing Warrant shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of such
Existing Warrant (subject to any applicable withholding tax as specified in
Section 2.7), an amount in cash without interest in respect thereof equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise or purchase price of such Existing Warrant and (ii) the number of
Shares subject to such Existing Warrant (such amount being hereinafter referred
to as the "Warrant Consideration") and each Existing Warrant shall be canceled
as of the Effective Time. Such payment shall be reduced by any income or
employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of such Existing Warrant.

            SECTION 2.5 Dissenting Shares.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are held by any record holder who has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal
rights in accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
Corporation Law; provided, however, that any holder of Dissenting Shares who
shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his rights of
appraisal with respect to such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the
Corporation Law, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares,
and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right
to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without
interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2.5(a), if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any
stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting Shares
shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations
under the Corporation Law with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares.

                  (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal, and any withdrawals of such demands, received by the
Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the Corporation
Law, and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or negotiate
or offer to settle any such demands.

            SECTION 2.6 Adjustments. If during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares
shall occur, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period (but not as a
result of the exercise of (i) Existing Stock Options or (ii) Existing Warrants),
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

            SECTION 2.7 Withholding Taxes. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Existing Stock Options or Existing
Warrants, pursuant to the Merger such amounts as are required to be withheld
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Existing Stock Options or Existing
Warrants, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
were made.

            SECTION 2.8 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the close of
business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed. At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no

immediately prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares
of capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of capital stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of capital stock previously represented by such Certificates. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as
provided in this Article II.

its Subsidiaries is a duly organized and validly existing corporation in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with all corporate
power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as currently

Letter, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good
standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the
jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under lease
by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing has
not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each of the Company's Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 3.2 Capitalization.

schedule or document required to be filed by the Company in connection with the

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to information supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or
an affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion therein. The Proxy Statement
will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and any other applicable laws. If at any time prior to the date of the Special
Meeting any event occurs which should be described in an amendment to the Proxy
Statement, the Company will file and disseminate, as required, an amendment or

its Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates, whether or not any of the
foregoing is funded, whether insured or self-funded and whether written or oral
and with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their

Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates and, to their knowledge, any
"administrator(s)" (as described in Section 3(16)(A) of ERISA) of the Employee
Benefit Plans have complied in all material respects with such Plans' terms and
with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable
Law, specifically including the reporting and disclosure requirements of Part 1
of Title I, and Title IV of ERISA and the Code, in a timely and accurate manner,
such that no material penalties are reasonably expected to be imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates, and no
material penalties may be imposed on Parent or Merger Sub under ERISA, the Code
or otherwise with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans or any related trusts.

                  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliates" shall
mean any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is part of the
same controlled group, or under common control with, or part of an affiliated
service group that includes, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the
meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

                  (d) With respect to the Employee Benefit Plans:

                        (i) No Employee Benefit Plan is, and no "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA which the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate has maintained or contributed to within the six (6) years
immediately preceding the date hereof was, (A) subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, (B) a "multiemployer" plan within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA or (C) a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of

Employee Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter that the plan
complies with the Code, as amended, pursuant to a request which accurately
described such plan, and has been administered and operated in all material
respects in accordance with all Laws so as to maintain such qualification.

                        (ii) Except as have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
all contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates through the date hereof with respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been
either paid or accrued on the Financial Statements to the extent required under
the terms of such plan or in accordance with GAAP.

                        (iii) Except as have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect,
there are no pending, or to the Company's knowledge, threatened or anticipated
material claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or
against any of the Employee Benefit Plans or any trust related thereto or, to
the knowledge of the Company, by, on behalf of or against any fiduciary of such
plans.

                  (e) Except as have not had or would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability, whether
absolute or contingent, direct or indirect, including any obligations under any
Employee Benefit Plan, with respect to any misclassification of a person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee or with respect to any
employees "leased" from another employer.

                  (f) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, with respect to employees or former employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries: (A) except as set forth in Section 3.9(f) of the
Disclosure Letter, entitle any individual to severance pay; or (B) except as set
forth in Section 2.4, accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, increase the
amount of, or satisfy a condition to the compensation due to any individual
under any Employee Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in Section 3.9(f) of the
Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, with respect to employees or former employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, result in the payment of an amount that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an
"excess parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

                  (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(g) of the Disclosure
Letter, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or will have any
material liability or obligation under any Employee Benefit Plan which provides
medical or death benefits with respect to current or former employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries beyond their termination of employment (other
than coverage mandated by Law); and (B) except as have not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA
Affiliates which maintains a "group health plan," within the meaning of Section
607(l) of ERISA has materially complied with the provisions of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and any other applicable
Law.

                  (h) Except as have not had or would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
subject to ERISA, other than such a transaction subject to an administrative or
statutory exemption, with respect to which a material tax, penalty or other
amount may reasonably be expected to be imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates.

                  (i) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, or any organization with respect to which any
such entity is a successor or parent corporation, within the meaning of Section
4069(b) of ERISA, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 of
ERISA which has had or would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) To the Company's knowledge, there has been no "mass
layoff" or "plant closing," as each such term is defined in the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1986, as amended ("WARN"), with
respect to the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with respect
to which there could be any future material liability to such employees under
WARN.

                  (k) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(k) of the Disclosure
Letter, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining or other labor union contract. To the Company's knowledge,
there are no union organization attempts underway with respect to any employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened material labor dispute, strike or work
stoppage involving such employees. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has committed any material unfair labor
practices (as defined in the National Labor Relations Acts of 1947, as amended)
in connection with the operation of its business and, except as set forth in
Section 3.9(k) of the Disclosure Letter, there is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened material charge or complaint against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or any
comparable state or local agency.

Subsidiaries (a) is, in any material respect, in conflict with, in default
under, in violation of or under investigation pursuant to any Law applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (b) has received
notice of or, to the knowledge of the Company, been threatened to be charged
with any of the foregoing, except where the failure to so comply has not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits,
licenses, authorizations, consents, approvals, certificates and franchises from
Governmental Entities required to conduct their businesses as currently
conducted (the "Company Permits"), except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the
Disclosure Letter and except for such permits, licenses, authorizations,
consents, approvals, certificates and franchises the absence of which has not
had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability
of the parties to consummate the Merger. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure so to
comply has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
ability of the parties to consummate the Merger.

            SECTION 3.13 Environmental Matters. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws except for such instances of non-compliance that have not had or would not

permits, licenses, consents, approvals, certificates, waivers, variances and
other authorizations ("Authorizations") that are required with respect to the
operation of their respective businesses, properties and assets under the
Environmental Laws and are in compliance with such Authorizations and all such
Authorizations are in full force and effect except for such non-compliance or
failures to be in full force and effect that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the Disclosure Letter,
none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject to any material claims,
actions, suits, proceedings, investigations, decrees, judgments or orders
pursuant to Environmental Law or principles of common law relating to pollution
of the environment or health and safety which have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no events, conditions or
circumstances which have resulted or are reasonably likely to result in
liability or costs pursuant to Environmental Laws or principles of common law
relating to pollution or protection of the environment or health and safety
which have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.14      Intellectual Property.

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the Disclosure
Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries own, or otherwise have the right
pursuant to a valid license, sublicense or other agreement to, the Company
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens, and have the right (subject
to any such license terms, if applicable) to use, make, have made, sell, offer
to sell, import, license, sublicense and otherwise exploit all Company
Intellectual Property in accordance with applicable Law.

                  (b) Section 3.14(b) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth all
registrations, issuances, filings and applications for any Intellectual Property
filed by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any predecessors, specifying as to
each item, as applicable: the nature of the item, including the title; the owner
of the item; the jurisdictions in which the item is issued or registered or in
which an application for issuance or registration has been filed; and the
issuance, registration, or application numbers and dates.

                  (c) Section 3.14(c) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth all
material IP Licenses under which the Company or any Subsidiary is a (i)
licensor, except for licenses of its commercially-marketed Software in the
ordinary course of business substantially under the Company's standard terms and
conditions for such licenses, or (ii) licensee, distributor, or reseller. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have substantially performed all obligations
imposed on them pursuant to the IP Licenses. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have made all payments to date required under all material IP Licenses, and are
not, nor to the knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary is another party
thereto, in breach of or material default thereunder in any respect, nor is
there any event that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
material default thereunder. All of the material IP Licenses are valid,
enforceable, and in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law), and, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, will continue to be so on identical terms immediately following
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the termination
of, or otherwise require the consent of any party to, any material IP License.

                  (d) All of the Company's and the Subsidiaries' rights in the
Company Intellectual Property are valid and enforceable with respect to all
Intellectual Property rights other than Patents and Trademarks, and to the best
of the Company's knowledge, with respect to Patents and Trademarks. The Company
and the Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions to maintain and
protect each item of Company Intellectual Property owned or purported to be
owned by the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company and the Subsidiaries have
taken commercially reasonable precautions to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality, and value of their material Trade Secrets and the proprietary
nature and value of their Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company's or any Subsidiary's material Trade Secrets, the
value of which is contingent upon maintenance of confidentiality thereof, has
been disclosed to any employee, representative or agent of the Company, a
Subsidiary or any other Person not obligated to maintain such material Trade
Secret in confidence under applicable law or pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement entered into with the Company or the applicable Subsidiary, except as
required by the applicable patent office pursuant to the filing of a patent
application by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary.

                  (e) Substantially all present employees involved with Software
development and each officer, consultant or any other Person not employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who developed any part of any Company or
Subsidiary product or any Intellectual Property that is or will be made, had
made, used, imported, or sold, offered for sale, licensed, sublicensed or
otherwise exploited by the Company or a Subsidiary within the past five (5)
years have executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary that (i) conveys any and all right, title and interest in
and to all Intellectual Property developed within the scope of such Person's
employment or engagement by such Person to the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary, (ii) establishes that to the extent such Person is an author of a
copyrighted work created in connection with such Person's employment or
contract, such work is a "work made for hire," and (iii) obligates the employee
or contractor to keep any confidential information of the Company or any
Subsidiary confidential both during and for a period of time after the term of
employment or contract. No such employee, consultant or other Person has
excluded works or inventions related to any business of the Company or the
Company Intellectual Property made prior to his employment with or work for the
Company or applicable Subsidiary from his/her assignment of inventions pursuant
to such proprietary invention agreements.

                  (f) To the knowledge of the Company, no former employer or
client of any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, and no current or
former client of any consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary, has made a
material Claim against such employee, consultant or any other Person, that such
employee or such consultant is utilizing or infringing upon Intellectual
Property of such former employer or client.

                  (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(g) of the Disclosure
Letter, it is not necessary for the Company's or any Subsidiary's business to
use any Intellectual Property owned by any present or past director, officer,
employee or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary (or Persons the Company
presently intends to hire).

                  (h) None of the Intellectual Property, products or services
owned, used, developed, provided, sold, licensed or imported by the Company or
any Subsidiary, or made for, used or sold by or licensed to the Company or any
Subsidiary by any Person (i) infringes upon or otherwise violates any
Intellectual Property rights (other than Patents and Trademarks) of any Person,
or (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, infringes upon or otherwise violates
any Patent or Trademark rights of any Person. To the knowledge of the Company,
other than as set forth in Section 3.14(h) of the Disclosure Letter, no Person
is infringing upon or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property rights of
the Company or any Subsidiary.

                  (i) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(i) of the Disclosure
Letter, there are no Claims pending, or to the knowledge of any of the Company,
threatened, and the Company knows of no basis for any Claim, (i) contesting the
right of the Company or any Subsidiary to use, make, have made, sell, offer to
sell, import, license, or otherwise exploit any of the Company's or any
Subsidiary's products or services currently or previously made, had made, sold,
offered for sale, licensed, imported or made available to any person or used by
the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) opposing or attempting to cancel any of
the Company's or any Subsidiary's rights in or to any Company Intellectual
Property.

                  (j) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(j) of the Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is party to or bound by any
license or other agreement requiring the payment by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any material royalty or license payment, excluding such agreements
relating to Off-the-Shelf Software.

                  (k) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(k) of the Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is bound by any non-competition
or similar agreement that would be binding upon Parent or Merger Sub after
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (l) All Software currently sold or licensed by the Company or
any Subsidiary for use by the Company's customers is identified in Section
3.14(l) of the Disclosure Letter. The Software performs in substantial
conformance with its documentation and, except as set forth in Section 3.14(l)
of the Disclosure Letter, is fully and freely transferable to Parent or Merger
Sub without any third party consents, is free from any material software defect
and, except as set forth in Section 3.14(l) of the Disclosure Letter, does not
contain any Self-Help Mechanism or Unauthorized Code.

                  (m) Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary is, nor, as a
result of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will be, in
violation of any agreement relating to any Company Intellectual Property. Upon
Closing, Merger Sub will own all right, title, and interest in and to or have a
valid written license to use all Company Intellectual Property on identical
terms and conditions as the Company or the applicable Subsidiary enjoyed
immediately prior to such transactions.

            SECTION 3.15      Real Property.

                  (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable
title to, or have a valid and enforceable right to use or a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest in, all real property (including all buildings,
fixtures and other improvements thereto) owned by them and material to the
conduct of their respective businesses as such businesses are now being
conducted. Neither the Company's nor any of its Subsidiaries' ownership of or
leasehold interest in any such property is subject to any mortgage, pledge,
Lien, option, conditional sale agreement, encumbrance, security interest, title,
exception or restriction or claim or charge of any kind ("Encumbrances"), except
for such Encumbrances as are set forth in Section 3.15(a) of the Disclosure
Letter or that have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All such property
is in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, and adequate in
all material respects for the continued conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the manner in which it is currently conducted, except to
the extent that the condition of any property is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Section 3.15(b) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
of all material leases, subleases and other agreements under which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries uses or occupies or has the right to use or occupy,
now or in the future, any material real property (the "Real Property Leases").
Each Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect, and to
the knowledge of the Company, no termination event or condition or uncured
default of a material nature on the part of the Company or any such Subsidiary
exists under any Real Property Lease. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has a good and valid leasehold interest in each parcel of real property leased
by it free and clear of all Liens, except (i) those reflected or reserved
against in the balance sheet of the Company dated as of December 31, 2003, (ii)
Taxes and general and special assessments not in default and payable without
penalty and interest and (iii) other Liens that do not materially interfere with
the Company's use and enjoyment of such real property or materially detract from
or diminish the value thereof or that have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.16      Material Contracts.

                  (a) Section 3.16(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list

arrangements, leases (including with respect to personal property) and other
instruments which have not been fully performed and for which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has any continuing obligations or liabilities thereunder (to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets is bound) that
involves or could involve aggregate payments of more than $250,000 that (A) are
not described in clauses (i) or (ii) or otherwise not set forth in any of
Sections 3.9, 3.14 or 3.15 of the Disclosure Letter, (B) are not liabilities and
obligations for fees and expenses incurred in connection with this transaction
and (C) do not relate to routine overhead and administrative costs or expenses
with respect to the facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are
incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices (the
contracts, agreements, commitments, arrangements, leases (including with respect
to personal property) and other instruments set forth in clauses (i) through
(iii) above, together with any contract, agreement or understanding required to
be set forth in Section 3.16(c) of the Disclosure Letter, each, a "Scheduled
Contract" and collectively, the "Scheduled Contracts"). Copies of all Scheduled
Contracts have been previously delivered to or made available by the Company for
inspection by Parent and Merger Sub, and such copies are true, complete and
correct.

                  (b) Each of the material Scheduled Contracts set forth in
clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 3.16(a) are valid and binding and are in full
force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except for such failures to be in full
force and effect or enforceable that has not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is not, in any material respect, in violation or breach of or
default under any Scheduled Contract nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any
other party to any such Scheduled Contract.

                  (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(c) of the Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound

line of business or to engage in business in any geographic area or to hire any
individual or group of individuals, (ii) containing covenants of any other
Person not to compete in any material respect with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) containing any so-called "most favored nation" provisions or
any similar provision requiring the Company or any Subsidiary (or after the

concessions at least as favorable as offered to one or more other parties, (iv)
providing for "earn-outs," "performance guarantees" or contingent payments by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries involving more than $100,000 over the
term of the contract, agreement or arrangement, (v) relating to indebtedness for
borrowed money, letters of credit, the deferred purchase price of property,
conditional sale arrangements, capital lease obligations, obligations secured by
a Lien, or interest rate or currency hedging activities (including guarantees

excluding trade payables arising in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, intercompany indebtedness and immaterial leases for
telephones, copy machines, facsimile machines and other office equipment) and

            SECTION 3.17 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors of
the Company has received the opinion of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.,
a copy of which has been provided to Parent, to the effect that, as of the date
of this Agreement, the consideration to be received in the Merger, by the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or its affiliates) is fair to such holders
from a financial point of view.

            SECTION 3.18 Anti-takeover Plan; State Takeover Statutes. Except for
the Company Rights Plan, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has in effect
any stockholder rights plan or similar device or arrangement, commonly or
colloquially known as a "poison pill" or "anti-takeover" plan or any similar
plan, device or arrangement and the Board of Directors of the Company has not
adopted or authorized the adoption of such a plan, device or arrangement. The
Board of Directors of the Company has taken all necessary actions to exempt the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
Section 203 of the Corporation Law. No other "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation of any jurisdiction applies or
purports to apply to the Merger, this Agreement, or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

            SECTION 3.19 Insurance. Except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the
Disclosure Letter or except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain, and have maintained, without
interruption, during its existence, policies or binders of insurance covering
such risk, and events, including personal injury, property damage and general
liability in amounts the Company reasonably believes adequate for its business
and operations, (ii) the Company has not received notice of termination or
cancellation of any such policy and such policies shall not terminate as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the
Company or its Subsidiaries are named insureds under such policies, (iv) all
premiums required to be paid with respect thereto covering all periods up to and
including the Effective Time have been paid and (v) there has been no lapse in
coverage under such policies during any period for which the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective operations. None of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has any obligation for retrospective premiums for any period
prior to the Effective Time which has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All such
policies are in full force and effect and will remain in full force and effect
to and including the Effective Time, unless replaced with comparable insurance
policies having comparable terms and conditions. Except as set forth in Section
3.19 of the Disclosure Letter, no insurer has put the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on notice that coverage may be denied with respect to any claim
submitted to such insurer by the Company or any such Subsidiary.

            SECTION 3.20 Trade Relations. There exists no actual or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened termination, cancellation or limitation of,
or any adverse modification or change in, the business relationship of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any distribution partner, customer or
supplier or any group of customers or suppliers whose purchases or inventories
provided to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business are, in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and there exists no
present condition or state of facts or circumstances that has had or would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
continuing such business relationships or such business with any such
distribution partner, customer, supplier or group of customers or suppliers in
the same manner as heretofore conducted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

by the Company and its Subsidiaries and sold for use by original equipment
manufacturer customers or the products sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries
but manufactured by third parties, conform to design in all material respects
and comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws. To the Company's
knowledge, there is no pending federal or state legislation, not otherwise
applicable to the Company's industry, which if adopted or enacted would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect as a result of the
products sold by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

                  (b) Section 3.21(b) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a
summary of each material recall (voluntary or involuntary) of products
manufactured by the Company or its Subsidiaries (or products containing products

year period prior to the date hereof, describing in each case the nature of the
problem giving rise to such recall, the approximate number of products recalled
and the aggregate costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
each such recall. Except as set forth in Section 3.21(b) of the Disclosure
Letter, during the three (3) year period prior to the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any material return or
Warranty Claims which in the aggregate in each of the last three (3) years, has
exceeded $250,000, with respect to products sold or services performed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries, nor are there any pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened material return or Warranty Claims with respect to
products sold or services performed by the Company and its Subsidiaries for
which the Company or its Subsidiaries may have continuing liability or
obligations as of the date hereof.

            SECTION 3.22 Potential Conflicts of Interest. Except as set forth in
Section 3.22 of the Disclosure Letter, no director, officer, employee or the
beneficial owner of one percent (1%) or more of the Shares nor any relative of

in business as, a competitor, lessor, lessee, supplier, distributor, sales agent
or customer of, or lender to or borrower from, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) owns, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any
tangible or intangible property that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company's affiliates (other than
Subsidiaries of the Company) or other Persons, on the other hand, that would be

Act.

            SECTION 3.23 Amendment to the Company Rights Plan. The Board of
Directors of the Company has taken all necessary action (including any amendment
thereof) under the Company Rights Plan (without redeeming the Rights) so that
none of the execution or delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will cause (i)
the Rights to become exercisable under the Company Rights Plan or to separate
from the stock certificates to which they are attached, (ii) a Flip-in Date or
Stock Acquisition Date (each as defined in the Company Rights Plan) to occur or
(iii) Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates to be deemed an Acquiring
Person (as defined in the Company Rights Plan). The Company has furnished Parent
with complete and correct copies of all such actions of the Board of Directors
of the Company. The Company has delivered to Parent a true, complete and correct
copy of the Company Rights Plan and the Company Rights Plan has not been further
modified or amended.

            SECTION 3.24 Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote at the
Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares in favor of adopting this Agreement (the
"Requisite Company Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of the Company's capital stock necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

and affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives (including, without limitation, investment bankers, attorneys
and accountants) or other agents (collectively, the "Representatives") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit or initiate any proposal or offer
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations (that are reasonably intended to facilitate the making of an

(including granting any waiver or release under any standstill or similar

"group" (as such terms are used for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any affiliate or associate of Parent or
Merger Sub) (each, a "Potential Acquiror") concerning any Acquisition Proposal.
In the event the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall as
promptly as practicable notify Parent of such receipt and provide Parent with
the identity of the Potential Acquiror and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal
or a reasonably detailed written summary setting forth the material terms and
conditions thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any
breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2(a) by any Subsidiary or
affiliate of the Company or any Representative shall be deemed to be a breach by
the Company of this Section 5.2(a).

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.2(a), the
Company may take any of the actions referred to in Section 5.2(a)(ii) with
respect to a Potential Acquiror that has made an unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the
Board of Directors of the Company (acting by a majority of the entire board)
determines in good faith, (A) after consultation with its independent financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in the
making of a Superior Proposal, and (B) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action in their reasonable judgment may
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; (ii) the
Company in its reasonable judgment keeps Parent advised on a current basis of
any material developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the
Company receives from such Potential Acquiror an executed confidentiality
agreement customary for a transaction of this type; provided, that if the
Company modifies or waives any standstill provision in such agreement for the
benefit of any such Potential Acquiror, the Company shall in the same manner
simultaneously modify or waive the standstill provision in the confidentiality
agreement that the Parent is a party to with the Company for the benefit of
Parent, and (iv) the Company furnishes or makes available to Parent the same
information provided to such Person (to the extent not previously furnished or
made available).

                  (c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
affiliates and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing solicitation, activity, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates or associates) conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

                  (d) The Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, including, without limitation, for purposes of Section 203 of the
Corporation Law or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle
or acquisition agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal.

                  (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2(e) shall prohibit
the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a
third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or otherwise communicating with the Company's stockholders to the extent
required by Law.

            SECTION 5.3 Access to Information.

                  (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall (i) give Parent and Merger Sub and their appropriate Representatives
reasonable access (during regular business hours upon reasonable notice) to the
facilities and books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii)
cause its officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger
Sub with such reasonable financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request;
provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the
extent that it reasonably concludes (A) it would interfere with the operation of
the Company's business in the ordinary course of business, (B) in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, after consultation with Company's outside counsel, any
law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access
to any such properties or information, (C) in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, after consultation with Company's outside counsel, the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party, or (D) disclosure of
any such information or document would, after consultation with Company's
outside counsel, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege.

                  (b) Information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 5.3(a) shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

            SECTION 5.4 Reasonable Efforts; Further Actions.

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided for
(including, without limitation, Section 5.11), each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make promptly any required
submissions under any applicable Law that the Company or Parent determines
should be made, in each case, with respect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries
received from any Governmental Entity with respect to such submissions for
additional information or documentation, and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained
under any applicable Law or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be or should be obtained from other parties to any material
contract, agreement or understanding (including, without limitation, under any
contract, agreement or understanding set forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure
Letter) and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents,
permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.

                  (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
Parent shall cause the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement to take all such necessary action.

                  (c) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is
commenced, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use all commercially
reasonable to defend vigorously against it and respond thereto.

            SECTION 5.5 Indemnification and Insurance.

                  (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of the present or former directors, officers
and employees (or any individual who served at the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' request as an officer, director, or agent) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any other entity or enterprise, such as a partnership,
joint venture, trust or employee benefit plan) as provided in (i) the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, (ii) or the articles of organization,
by-laws or similar organizational documents of any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or other entity or enterprise or (iii) under any indemnification agreements of
the Company set forth in Section 5.5(a) of the Disclosure Letter as in effect as
of the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and Parent in the Merger,
without further action, and shall continue in full force and effect without
modification (other than modifications that would enlarge the indemnification
rights) for a period of not less than the statutes of limitations applicable to
such matters, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
comply fully with its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

                  (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
(other than another direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent) and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person (other than any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent), or
otherwise dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.5(b) by operation of law or otherwise.

                  (c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
and fiduciary insurance covering the individuals described in Section 5.5(a)
(which may include naming such individuals under Parent's existing policies);
and such policies provided by Parent shall provide substantially similar
coverage as is provided for the individuals who are covered by the Company's
existing policies; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required in order
to maintain such policies to pay an annual premium in excess of two hundred
percent (200%) of the price set forth on Section 5.5(c) of the Disclosure
Letter; provided, further, that, if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or
can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of two hundred
percent (200%) of such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall only be required
to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal
to two hundred percent (200%) of such amount.

                  (d) The provisions of this Section 5.5(d) are (i) intended to
be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

            SECTION 5.6 Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall:

                  (a) prepare and, after consultation with and review by Parent,
file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the special meeting
of the stockholders of the Company (the "Special Meeting") to be held to
consider approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and, after
consultation with and review by Parent, to respond promptly to any comments made
by the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and promptly cause a
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders and, if necessary,
after the definitive Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly
circulate amended or supplemental proxy material and, if required in connection
therewith, resolicit proxies; provided, that no such amended or supplemental
proxy material will be mailed by the Company without consultation with and
review by Parent and (ii) to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger and
this Agreement by its stockholders;

                  (b) promptly notify Parent of the receipt of the comments of
the SEC and of any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
preliminary Proxy Statement or the definitive Proxy Statement or for additional
information, and will promptly supply Parent with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company or its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the definitive Proxy Statement or the Merger; and

                  (c) promptly inform Parent if at any time prior to the Special
Meeting any event should occur that is required by applicable law to be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, in which
case, the Company, with the cooperation of and in consultation with Parent,
will, upon learning of such event, promptly prepare and mail such amendment or
supplement.

                  (d) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that none of the
information supplied in writing by it to be included or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto,
will, on the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. It is expressly
understood and agreed that (i) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate
with each other in connection with all aspects of the preparation, filing and
clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary proxy and
any and all amendments or supplements thereto), (ii) the Company shall give
Parent and its outside counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement
prior to it being filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its outside
counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy
Statement and all responses to requests for additional information and replies
to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC and each of the
Company and Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts, after
consultation with the other, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC, (iii) to the extent practicable, the Company and its
outside counsel shall permit Parent and its outside counsel to participate in
all communications with the SEC and its staff (including, without limitation,
all meetings and telephone conferences) relating to the Proxy Statement, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby and (iv) the Company
will not file with, or send to, the SEC the Proxy Statement (including the
preliminary Proxy Statement and any and all amendments or supplements thereto
and any and all responses to requests for additional information and replies to
comments relating thereto) or mail any Proxy Statement (including the
preliminary Proxy Statement and any and all amendments or supplements thereto)
or use any proxy material in connection with the Special Meeting, in each case
without Parent's prior approval (not to be unreasonably withheld).

                  (e) The Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous and
unconditional recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company to the
stockholders of the Company that they vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the
Company may, at any time prior to the Effective Time, withdraw, modify or change
any such recommendation solely in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.2
hereof. In addition, the Proxy Statement and the Proxy Materials will include a
copy of the written opinion of the Financial Advisor referred to in Section
3.17.

            SECTION 5.7 Special Meeting. The Company shall call and hold the
Special Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of voting
upon the approval of this Agreement and Parent and the Company will cooperate
with each other to cause the Special Meeting to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Materials to the stockholders of
the Company. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (through
its agents or otherwise) to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the approval of this Agreement, and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Requisite Company Vote, except to the extent that the
Board of Directors of the Company withdraws, modifies or changes its
recommendation in favor of the Merger as provided in Section 5.2(d) hereof.

            SECTION 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be, shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which is
likely (a) to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made as of
any time at or prior to the Effective Time and (b) to result in any material
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties sending
or receiving such notice.

            SECTION 5.9 Press Releases and Communications.

                  (a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation (and
affording the other party or parties an opportunity to comment thereon), except
as may be required by applicable Law or by the rules of any stock exchange on
which such party is listed.

                  (b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, not to communicate
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby except
in compliance with applicable Law.

            SECTION 5.10      Employee Benefits Matters.


                  (a) Other than as specifically provided in this Agreement,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Company to,
honor in accordance with their terms all existing employment, severance and
consulting agreements of any current or former officer, director, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that were disclosed on
Section 3.9(a) of the Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall preclude Parent or any of its Affiliates from having the right to
terminate the employment of any employee, with or without cause, or to amend or
terminate in accordance with its terms and applicable law any (i) Employee
Benefit Plan or (ii) employee benefit plan of Parent established, maintained or
contributed to by Parent or any of its Affiliates ("Parent Benefit Plan") after
the Effective Time.

                  (b) Except as specifically provided herein, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Company to, cause service
rendered by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time to be taken into account for vesting and eligibility purposes under all
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements of Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries in which such employees participate or are offered
participation (other than any retiree medical plans or defined benefit pension
plans sponsored or maintained by the Parent), to the same extent as such service
was taken into account under the corresponding plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for those purposes prior to the Effective Time, provided that
nothing herein shall result in the duplication of any benefits. Employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will not be subject to any pre-existing condition
limitation under any health plan of Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries for
any condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which they participated
prior to the Effective Time. Parent will and will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to give employees credit under such plans for co-payments made and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) From and after the Effective Time until the first
anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide, or cause the Company to provide,
benefits to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate than the benefits provided under the Employee
Benefit Plans (but excluding any such Employee Benefit Plan providing for
options or other stock-based awards); provided, however, that nothing herein
shall preclude Parent or any of its Affiliates from having the right to amend or
terminate in accordance with its terms and applicable law any Employee Benefit
Plan or Parent Benefit Plan.

            SECTION 5.11      HSR Act Filings.

                  (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) make or cause to
be made the filings required of such party hereto or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates under the HSR Act and any similar foreign competition or Antitrust
Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable and, with respect to the HSR Act, in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, (B) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or any similar foreign
competition or Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents, or other
materials received by such party hereto or any of its subsidiaries from the
United States Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or such
transactions, and (C) cooperate with the other party in connection with any such
filing (including, with respect to the party hereto making a filing, providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to
filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Entity
under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other
parties hereto of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking, or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such
filing. No party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting, or
engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other
party hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. The parties
hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other foreign competition
or Antitrust Laws. Each of the parties hereto will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to secure termination of any waiting periods under the HSR
Act and any similar foreign competition or Antitrust Laws and obtain the
approval of any other Governmental Entity for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to
the other under this Section 5.11 "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may
be) or its legal counsel; provided, however, that materials concerning the
valuation of the Company may be redacted.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their
respective businesses or assets, or to take or agree to take any action or agree
to any limitation with respect to the ownership or holding of any of their
respective businesses or assets, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate (including by trust or
otherwise) or to divest any of their respective businesses or assets, or to take
or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation with respect to the
ownership or holding of any of their respective businesses or assets, (iii)
neither any party hereto nor their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to
take any action that could reasonably be expected to substantially impair the
benefits expected to be realized by Parent from consummation of the Merger or
(iv) Parent shall not be required after consummation of the Merger to Company to
hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of the
respective businesses or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to
take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation with respect
to the ownership or holding of any of the respective businesses or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 5.12 Stockholder Litigation. To the extent consistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, the Company shall consult with
Parent in connection with any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or
its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Voting Agreements, and no settlement shall be agreed with respect to such
stockholder litigation without Parent's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

            SECTION 5.13 Rights Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall take all further action (in addition to that referred to in Section 3.23)
reasonably requested in writing by Parent in order to render the Rights
inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            SECTION 5.14 Resignations of Directors and Officers. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to cause (i) each of the directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries to have tendered to Merger Sub their
written resignations from the Board of Directors of the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, in each case effective as of the Effective Time,
and (ii) each of the officers of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries set
forth in Section 5.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to have tendered to
Merger Sub their written resignations from such offices of the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, effective as of the Effective Time.

            SECTION 5.15 FIRPTA Affidavit. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide to Parent a certificate stating that the Company is not a
"United States Real Property Holding Corporation" as defined in section 897 of
the Code in accordance with Treasury Regulations promulgated under sections 897
and 1445 of the Code; provided, however, that if the Company does not provide
such certificate, Parent may withhold Taxes as provided in Section 2.7 of this
Agreement.

warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier date);
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
condition set forth in this Section and 6.3(a) shall be deemed to have been
satisfied even if any representations and warranties of the Parent and Merger
Sub are not true and correct unless the failure of such representations and
warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub to be true and correct (read for
purposes of this Section 6.3(a) without any "materiality" qualification) has had

definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that (i) the Company is not and has not been in breach of
Section 5.2, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company,

(including any subsequent amendments or modifications) or otherwise providing a
reasonably detailed written summary of the Superior Proposal, (iii) during the
five (5) Business Day period after the Company's notice, (x) the Company shall

termination as a condition to the effectiveness thereof.

                  (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay

shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest from the date

enforce this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be entitled to recover from
the other party the costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and
expert witness fees) incurred in connection with such action.

            SECTION 7.4 Amendment. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended by action taken by or on behalf of the Boards of
Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time before or after
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company but, after any
such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Company's
stockholders hereunder without the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

            SECTION 7.5 Extension; Waiver; Remedies.

                  (a) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties

any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

                  (b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this
Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be
cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party
shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right,
power or remedy by such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any
rights, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in
respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other
party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the
parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such
party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to
demand such compliance.

            SECTION 8.6 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD
TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

            SECTION 8.7 Jurisdiction. All actions brought, arising out of, or
related to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the federal
or state courts of the State of Delaware. Each party hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of the State of
Delaware in respect of any claim relating to the interpretation and enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding in which any such claim
is made that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding
may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or
by such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over such parties and over the subject matter of any such claim and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.5, or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Law, shall be valid and sufficient thereof.

            SECTION 8.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury.
Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no Representative of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not,
in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) such
party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) such
party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) such party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers, agreements
and certifications in this Section 8.8.

            SECTION 8.9 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

            SECTION 8.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for Section 5.5 (which are intended to be for the benefit of
the individuals referred to therein, and may be enforced by any such
individuals).

            SECTION 8.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which,
taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

            SECTION 8.12 Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute
such documents and perform such further acts (including, without limitation,
obtaining any consents, exemptions, authorizations or other actions by, or
giving any notices to, or making any filings with, any Governmental Entity or
any other Person) as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out or to
perform the provisions of this Agreement.

            SECTION 8.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity.
