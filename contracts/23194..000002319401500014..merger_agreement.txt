Offer.   (a) Provided that none of the events set forth in Annex A hereto
shall have occurred or be continuing, Purchaser shall commence the Offer as
promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later than seven (7)
business days after the date hereof. The obligation of Purchaser to accept
for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) the
condition (the "Minimum Condition") that at least the number of Shares
tendered shall constitute a 50% plus one share of the sum of the number of
then outstanding Shares plus all Shares issuable upon the exercise of the
Outstanding Options (as of the business day preceding the Initial Expiration
Date) and Outstanding Warrants (as of the business day preceding the Initial
Expiration Date) shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to
the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver of each of
the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to waive any such condition set forth in Annex A, to
increase the Per Share Amount, and to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that no change may be made which
decreases the Per Share Amount, changes the form of consideration payable,
reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer or imposes
or modifies (other than to waive) conditions to the Offer in addition to
those set forth in Annex A hereto. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this
Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the Minimum Condition as of the
scheduled expiration date, which shall initially be 20 business days
following the commencement of the Offer, and the other conditions set forth
in Annex A hereto, Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after such expiration date of the Offer (such date, as extended
pursuant to this Agreement, the "Share Acceptance Date"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall be entitled to extend the Offer from time to time
without the consent of the Company: (i) until no later than January 11, 2002
if at the initial expiration of the Offer, which will be 12:00 midnight
eastern standard time on the twentieth business day following  
5    commencement of the Offer, as may be extended (the "Initial
Expiration Date"), the Minimum Condition is not satisfied, or (ii) until no
later than December 31, 2001, if at the Initial Expiration Date, the Minimum
Condition is satisfied, but any other condition to the Offer is not satisfied
or waived. Purchaser agrees to extend the Offer from time to time until not
later than December 31, 2001, if at the then scheduled expiration date, the
Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or waived as permitted by this
Agreement. Any extension of the Offer pursuant to this Section 2.01 shall
not, without the written consent of the Company, exceed the number of days
that Purchaser reasonably believes will be necessary so that the Minimum
Condition will be satisfied. In addition, Purchaser may, without the consent
of the Company, extend any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer for
any period required by applicable rules, regulations, interpretations
or positions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer or for any period required by
applicable law. If the Initial Expiration Date has occurred, but fewer than
90% of the Shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the
Initial Expiration Date, Purchaser may provide for a subsequent offering
period (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act")) as long as providing for the subsequent
offering period does not require the extension of the initial offer period
under applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, which subsequent offering
period shall not exceed 20 business days. In addition, the Per Share Amount
may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent required by law
in connection with such increase in each case without the consent of the
Company. On or prior to the dates that Purchaser becomes obligated to accept
for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Holdings shall provide
or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary to pay for all
Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to accept for payment and pay for
pursuant to the Offer.   The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable
withholding of taxes, be net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of
the Offer, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares
in order to comply in whole or in part with applicable laws. Any such delay
shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act.   (b) Following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause all holders (and such holders\'
spouses) of options to purchase Shares granted under the Company\'s 1997
Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Company\'s Directors Non-Qualified Option
Plan , each as amended through the date of this Agreement (the "Company Stock
Option Plans"), to execute prior to the Initial Expiration Date an Option
Relinquishment and Release Agreement (herein so called) in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A. At the Share Acceptance Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay to   6    such holders who have previously delivered
an Option Relinquishment and Release Agreement the cash amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of Shares subject to such option (irrespective of
whether such option is then exercisable) and (ii) the amount by which the Per
Share Amount exceeds the exercise or strike price per Share subject to such
option less any required withholding taxes. In the event that an option
holder fails to deliver an Option Relinquishment and Release Agreement prior
to the Initial Expiration Date, such holder\'s options (the "Outstanding
Options") shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the governing
Company Stock Option Plan and the holder\'s stock option agreement(s), be
converted without any action on the part of the holder thereof into the right
to receive Merger Consideration upon the exercise of such holder\'s options
in accordance with, and within the time period prescribed by, the applicable
Company Stock Option Plan and the holder\'s stock option agreement(s). The
Purchaser shall pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay, to each holder of
Outstanding Options, the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding
taxes, as promptly as practicable after receiving a valid exercise of such
options by the holder thereof. To the extent that options to purchase the
Company\'s common stock are exercised by holders prior to the Effective
Time, such holders shall receive certificates evidencing the Shares
underlying the options and may surrender such certificates to the Paying
Agent at the Effective Time for payment in cash as provided in Article III
hereof.   (c) Following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
send to holders of warrants to purchase Shares written notice of the Offer
and Merger and such information required by the terms of such warrant. The
Company shall send to all such persons a Warrant Relinquishment and Release
Agreement (herein so called) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all holders of warrants (and
such holders\' spouses) to execute prior to the Initial Expiration Date a
Warrant Relinquishment and Release Agreement. At the Share Acceptance Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to such holders who have
previously delivered a Warrant Relinquishment and Release Agreement the cash
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to such
warrant and (ii) the amount by which the Per Share Amount exceeds the
exercise price per share of Shares subject to such warrant less any required
withholding taxes. In the event that a warrant holder fails to deliver a
Warrant Relinquishment and Release Agreement prior to the Initial Expiration
Date, such holder\'s warrants (the "Outstanding Warrants") shall, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Outstanding Warrant
be converted without any action on the part of the holder thereof into the
right to receive Merger Consideration upon the exercise of such holder\'s
warrants in accordance with the warrant agreement(s). The Purchaser shall
pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay, to each holder of Outstanding
Warrants, the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding taxes, as
promptly as practicable after receiving a valid exercise of such warrants by
the holder thereof. To the extent that warrants to purchase the Shares are
exercised by holders prior to the Effective Time, such holders shall receive
certificates evidencing the Shares underlying the warrants and may surrender
such certificates to the Paying Agent at the Effective Time for payment in
cash as provided in Article III hereof.   (d) If the payment equal to the
Per Share Amount in cash (the "Merger Consideration") is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate
formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
certificate   7     surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Purchaser that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.   (e) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer.   The Schedule TO
shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the
"Offer to Purchase") and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any
related summary advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and
such other documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto,
being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). Each of CRI,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and CRI and Purchaser further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. CRI and Purchaser shall give the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to such documents being filed with the SEC or
disseminated to holders of Shares. CRI and Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments CRI, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents after
the receipt of such comments and shall provide the Company and its counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of CRI or
Purchaser to such comments.   SECTION 2.02 Company Action.    (a) The
Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents that (i)
the Board, at a meeting duly called and held on November 4, 2001, has (a)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively,
the "Transactions"), are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders
of Shares, (b) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and
the Transactions (such approval and adoption having been made in accordance
with Delaware Law, including, without limitation, Section 203 thereof) and
(c) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Co., Inc.
("FBR") has delivered to the Board its opinion that the consideration to be
received by the holders of Shares pursuant to each of the Offer and the
Merger is fair to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view (the
"Fairness Opinion"). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board described in the
immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall not withdraw or modify
such recommendation in any manner adverse to CRI, Holdings or Purchaser
except as provided in Section 7.05(b). The Company has been advised by its
directors and executive officers that they intend to tender all Shares
beneficially owned by them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.   8     
(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
containing the Fairness Opinion and, except as provided in Section 7.05(b),
the recommendation of the Board described in Section 2.02(a) (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9"), and shall
disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent required by Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal
securities laws. Each of CRI, Holdings, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
which shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall give CRI, Holdings, and Purchaser and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 prior to such document being filed with the SEC or disseminated to
holders of Shares. The Company shall provide CRI, Holdings, and Purchaser and
their counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 after the receipt of
such comments and shall provide CRI, Holdings, Purchaser and their counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of the Company
to such comments.   (c) The Company shall promptly cause its transfer agent
to furnish Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and addresses
of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares
held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other
available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and
security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of Shares.
The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such additional
information, including, without limitation, updated listings and computer
files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and
such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of
Shares as CRI, Holdings, or Purchaser may reasonably request. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer or the Merger, CRI, Holdings, and Purchaser shall hold
in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions, and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, shall
deliver and shall cause their agents to deliver to the Company all copies of
such information then in their possession or control.   ARTICLE III  THE
MERGER   SECTION 3.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, and in
accordance with Delaware Law, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the
Company.   SECTION 3.02 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable
(but not later than two business days) after the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing this Agreement or a
certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger (in either case,
the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as   9     is required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the date and time
of such filing being the "Effective Time"). Prior to such filing, a closing
shall be held at the offices of Locke Liddell and Sapp LLP, 2200 Ross Avenue,
Suite 2200, Dallas, Texas 75201, or such other place as the parties shall
agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case
may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VIII.   SECTION 3.03 Effect
of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 3.04 Certificate of
Incorporation; By-laws.    (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation; provided, however, that, at the Effective Time, Article I of
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is DevX Energy,
Inc."   (b) Unless otherwise determined by CRI prior to the Effective
Time, and subject to Section 7.07(a), the By-laws of Purchaser, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-
laws.   SECTION 3.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.   SECTION
3.06 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders
of any of the following securities:   (a) each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 3.06(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration payable, without
interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided
in Section 3.09, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share;  
10     (b) each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each
Share owned by CRI, Holdings, Purchaser, or the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and   (c) each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
SECTION 3.07 Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither
voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall
have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders
who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.09, of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Shares.   (b) The Company shall give CRI (i) prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of CRI, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.   SECTION 3.08 Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer
Books.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of
Shares to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 3.06(a) and CRI shall make funds available to the Paying
Agent. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.06(a) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in    11   effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive and CRI shall
cause Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall
then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit
of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment equal to the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on
the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Purchaser that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. If any holder of Shares is unable to surrender such holder\'s
Certificates because such Certificates have been lost, mutilated or
destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity
bond in a reasonable amount in form and substance and with surety reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation.   (c) At any time following the
sixth month after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had
been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received
by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and,
thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation and CRI (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law.   (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
law.   ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   As an

Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction

Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each
Subsidiary, the percentage of the outstanding capital stock of each
Subsidiary owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary and the names of
the directors and officers of each Subsidiary, is set forth in Section
4.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, which has been prepared by the Company
and delivered by the Company to CRI, Holdings and Purchaser prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"). Except
as disclosed in Section 4.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company does

previously conducted business or was known as are listed in Section 4.01(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule.   SECTION 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws. The Company has heretofore furnished to CRI a complete and correct
copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each

Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational
documents.   13     SECTION 4.03 Capitalization. The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.234 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock") of which 9,600,000 shares have
been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, 9,600,000 shares have been
designated as Series B Preferred Stock and 10,400 shares have been designated

(c) no Shares are held by the Subsidiaries, (d) 522,500 Shares are reserved
for future issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options or stock incentive
rights granted pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans and (e) 265,000
Shares are reserved for future issuance pursuant to exercise of the Warrants.
As of the date hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued and
outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section 4.03 or in Section 4.03 of
the Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to
the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or
obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any
Subsidiary. Section 4.03 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following
information with respect to each Company Stock Option and Warrant outstanding
on the date of this Agreement: (i) the name of the Option or Warrant holder;
(ii) the particular plan pursuant to which such Company Stock Option was
granted; (iii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option or
Warrant; (iv) the exercise price of such Company Stock Option or Warrant; (v)
the date on which such Company Stock Option or Warrant was granted or issued;
(vi) the applicable vesting schedule; (vii) the date on which such Company
Stock Option or Warrant expires; and (viii) whether the exercisability of
such Option or Warrant will be accelerated in any way by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All Shares subject to issuance as aforesaid,
upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Shares or any capital stock of any Subsidiary or
to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or any other person.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.03 of the Disclosure Schedule, each
outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each such share is owned by
the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests,
liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements,
limitations on the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s voting rights, charges and
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.   SECTION 4.04 Authority
Relative to This Agreement. The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Shares, if and
to the extent required by applicable law, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by Delaware Law). This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by CRI, Holdings, and
Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. At a meeting
duly called and held on November 4, 2001, the Board approved this Agreement
and the Transactions, and such approvals are sufficient so that the
restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of Delaware
Law shall not apply to the Merger.   SECTION 4.05 No Conflict; Required
Filings and Consents.   (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not, (i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions
described in Section 4.05(b) have been obtained and all filings and
obligations described in Section 4.05(b) have been made, conflict with or
violate any United States or non-United States national, state, provincial,
municipal, county or local statute, law,   14     ordinance,
regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or
other order ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (iii) other than as described in Section 4.05(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on
any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to or under,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or by which any property or asset of the Company or
any Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, with respect to clause (ii) or
(iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification to, any United States or non-United States national,
state, provincial, municipal, county or local government, governmental,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency, instrumentality or commission
or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a "Governmental
Authority"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange
Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and state takeover
laws, (ii) filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required
by Delaware Law, and (iii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or the Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company
from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.06 Permits; Compliance. Each of the
Company and the Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for each of the Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, or as presently contemplated to be conducted (the "Permits"),
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any
of the Permits would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, which suspension or
cancellation would have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of,
(a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(b) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
Permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound, except for any
such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that would not prevent
or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger or otherwise
prevent or   15    materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 4.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) The
Company has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC since July 1, 1999, including (i) its Transition Report on Form

the "SEC Reports"). The SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with
either the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were
filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including,
in each case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and each fairly presents,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as

2001 including the notes thereto (the "Recent Balance Sheet") or as
specifically disclosed in SEC Reports filed since June 30, 2001 and prior to
the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise), except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30,
2001.   (d) The Company has heretofore furnished to CRI complete and
correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been filed
by the Company with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other
instruments that previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and
are currently in effect.   SECTION 4.08 Absence of Certain Changes or
Events. Since December 31, 2000, except as set forth in Section 4.08 of the
Disclosure Schedule, or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, or

the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, before
any Governmental Authority that would have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any property or asset of the Company or
any Subsidiary is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or similar written agreement with, or continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority that
would prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger or

obligations under this Agreement or would have a Material Adverse Effect.  
SECTION 4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule lists (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"))
and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive,
deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental
retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and
all employment, termination, severance or other contracts or agreements,
whether legally enforceable or not, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
a party, with respect to which the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or
former employee, officer or director of, or any current or former consultant
to, the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) each employee benefit plan for which
the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069 of
ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be terminated, (iii)
any plan in respect of which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur
liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any contracts,
arrangements or understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary and any
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary including, without limitation, any
contracts, arrangements or understandings relating in any way to a sale of
the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Plans"). Each Plan is in
writing (or a written summary exists) and the Company has made available to
Purchaser a true and complete copy of each Plan and has made available to
Purchaser a true and complete copy of each material document, if any,
prepared in connection with each such Plan, including, without limitation,
(i) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, if such a trust or
funding arrangement exists, (ii) each summary plan description and summary of
material modifications thereto, (iii) the most recent three years\' Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") Forms 5500, if applicable (iv) the most recently
received IRS determination letter for each such Plan, if applicable, and (v)
the most recent three years\' actuarial reports and financial statements in
connection with each such Plan, if applicable.   (b) None of the Plans is a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single-employer plan (within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any Subsidiary
could incur liability under Section 4063 or    17    4064 of ERISA (a
"Multiple Employer Plan"). Except as listed in Section 4.10(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Plans (i) provides for the payment
of separation, severance or similar-type benefits to any person, (ii)
obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to pay separation, severance or
similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) obligates the Company or any
Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit as a result of a
"change in control", within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Except as listed
in Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Plans provides for
or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary.   (c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The
Company and the Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be
performed by them under, are not in any material respect in default under or
in violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or violation
by any party to, any Plan. No Action or any audit or investigation by any
Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such Action.   (d) Each Plan that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely received a
favorable determination, opinion, advisory or notification letter from the
IRS that the Plan is so qualified and each trust established in connection
with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code has received an opinion, advisory or
modification letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and no fact or event
has occurred since the date of such letter or letters from the IRS that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.   (e) There has not been to the
best of Company\'s knowledge any prohibited transaction (within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any
Plan. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than
liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in
the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.  
(f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All
such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no
such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental
Authority and no fact or event exists to the best of Company\'s knowledge
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such challenge or
disallowance.   18     (g) None of the Plans is subject to the laws of
any country other than the United States.   SECTION 4.11 Labor and
Employment Matters.   (a) Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list of all employees of the Company and any Subsidiary, together with
their dates of hire, and any employees currently on leave of absence,
indicating the nature of and length of such leave and whether such employees
have employment agreements. The Company has previously provided to CRI a
schedule setting forth current base salary and total wages paid in the prior
year for all employees listed in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule.
Except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are
no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of their respective employees;
(ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, are there any activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any such employees; (iii) there are no unfair labor
practice complaints pending against the Company or any Subsidiary before the
National Labor Relations Board or any current union representation questions
involving employees of the Company or any Subsidiary; (iv) there is no

AGREEMENTS   SECTION 7.01 Stockholders\' Meeting.    (a) If required by
applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through
the Board, shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, (i) duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders as promptly
as practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purpose
of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the Merger
(the "Stockholders\' Meeting") and (ii) (a) include in the Proxy Statement,
and not subsequently withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to CRI, Holding
or Purchaser, the recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of the
Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Transactions and (b) use its
best efforts to obtain such approval and adoption. At the Stockholders\'
Meeting, CRI, Holdings and Purchaser shall cause all Shares then owned by
them and their subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the Transactions.   (b) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that Purchaser shall acquire at least 90% of the then
outstanding Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective, in accordance with Section
253 of Delaware Law, as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company.  
SECTION 7.02 Proxy Statement. If approval of the Company\'s stockholders
is required by applicable law to consummate the Merger, promptly
following consummation of the Offer, the Company shall file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use its best efforts
to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable.
CRI, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify CRI of the
receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to CRI promptly copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any representative of the Company and
the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall give CRI and its counsel the
opportunity to review the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and
supplements thereto, prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall give CRI
and its counsel the opportunity to review all responses to requests for
additional information and replies to comments prior to their being filed
with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Company, CRI, Holdings and Purchaser
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after   30    consultation
with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of
and requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares
entitled to vote at the Stockholders\' Meeting at the earliest
practicable time.   SECTION 7.03 Company Board Representation; Section
14(f).    (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser of 50% plus one Share
of the outstanding Shares (including Shares purchased pursuant to the
Offer), Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board as shall give
Purchaser representation on the Board equal to the product of the total
number of directors on the Board (giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate of
Purchaser following such purchase bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, promptly take all actions
necessary to cause Purchaser\'s designees to be elected as directors of the
Company, including increasing the size of the Board or securing the
resignations of incumbent directors, or both. At such times, the Company
shall use its best efforts to cause persons designated by Purchaser
to constitute the same percentage as persons designated by Purchaser
shall constitute of the Board of (i) each committee of the Board, (ii) each
board of directors of each Subsidiary, and (iii) each committee of each such
board, in each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, at the request of
CRI, the Company shall use its best efforts to ensure that at least two
members of the Board and each committee of the Board and such boards and
committees of the Subsidiaries, as of the date hereof, who are not employees
of the Company shall remain members of the Board and of such boards and
committees.   (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this Section 7.03, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company
and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. CRI, Holdings or Purchaser shall supply to
the Company, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to
either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.   (c) Following the election
of designees of Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.03, prior to the
Effective Time, any amendment of this Agreement or the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of CRI, Holdings or Purchaser, or waiver
of any of the Company\'s rights hereunder, shall require the concurrence of a
majority of the directors of the Company then in office who neither were
designated by Purchaser nor are employees of the Company or any Subsidiary,
and, if serving on the Board currently, were disinterested directors in
connection with the Board\'s consideration of this Agreement.   31    
SECTION 7.04 Access to Information; Confidentiality.   (a) From the date
hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of
the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and
agents of CRI and Purchaser and persons providing or proposing to provide
CRI, Holdings or Purchaser with financing for the Transactions
complete access at all reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the
Company and each Subsidiary, and shall furnish CRI, Holdings and Purchaser
and persons providing or proposing to provide CRI, Holdings or Purchaser with
financing for the Transactions with such financial, operating and other data
and information as CRI, Holdings or Purchaser, through their officers,
employees or agents, may reasonably request.   (b) All information obtained
by CRI, Holdings or Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated January
16, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between CRI and the Company and
nothing herein shall limit or abrogate the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, except as set forth in Section 7.10.   (c) No investigation
pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall affect any representation or warranty in
this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto or any condition to the Offer.   SECTION 7.05 No
Solicitation of Transactions.   (a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
through any officer, director, advisor or other person acting on its behalf
shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage in any way any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may furnish
information to and negotiate with a third party (a "Potential Acquirer") if
the Potential Acquirer has, in circumstances not involving any breach by the
Company of the foregoing provisions, made a tender or exchange offer for, or
a proposal to the Board to acquire 20% or more of the Shares, and (A) the
Board determines in good faith, based on the advice of outside counsel, that
the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, and
(B) the Company\'s Board is advised by its financial advisor that such
Potential Acquirer has the financial wherewithal to consummate the
acquisition and such acquisition would be more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company than the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)
Except as set forth in this Section 7.05(b), neither the Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to CRI, Holdings or Purchaser, the approval
or recommendation by the Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that, prior to the Share Acceptance Date pursuant to the Offer, the
Board determines in good faith that it is required to do so by its fiduciary
duties under applicable law after having received advice from outside legal
counsel, the Board may withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Offer and the Merger, but only to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.01(d)(ii) (and,   31    concurrently with such
termination, cause the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal).   (c) The Company shall, and shall direct or cause its
directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with third
parties that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.   (d)
The Company shall promptly advise CRI in writing (within 48 hours) of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal.   SECTION 7.06
Employee Matters. The Company and the Subsidiaries will cooperate with
Purchaser in making their employees available during regular business hours
for Purchaser to conduct interviews to determine the prospect of continuing
employment of such employees following the Effective Time. As soon
as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event not later than the
Share Acceptance Date, Purchaser will provide to the Company a list of the
employees whom it intends to continue to employ, and a summary of the
material terms of such employment, which terms shall not be less favorable
than such employee\'s current employment terms, provided that such employees
who are retained and for whom a retention bonus would be due and payable (as
disclosed in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule) shall be paid such
bonus on December 31, 2001. At any time after receipt of the list, the
Company may terminate any employees whose names are not on such list and
shall pay any severance to such employees to which they may be entitled under
the terms of any employment contract, termination agreement or policies in
existence as of October 19, 2001 or as described in Section 7.06 of the
Disclosure Schedule. Nothing contained in this Section 7.06 shall change the
nature of the "at will" employment relationship that exists between the
Company, the Subsidiaries, and their employees. After the Effective Date, CRI
will cause the Company to maintain welfare benefit plans with benefits no
less favorable to the persons covered thereby than the Company\'s existing
welfare benefit plans for such period of time as is necessary for the Company
to fulfill its obligations under the Company\'s existing contracts and
policies. The previous sentence may not be amended or waived without the
consent of the persons for whom the Company is obligated to
provide coverage.   SECTION 7.07 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification
and Insurance.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in Article VI of the By-laws of the
Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would materially adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless
such modification shall be required by law.   (b) CRI shall maintain the
directors\' and officers\' ("DandO;") insurance that serves to reimburse
persons currently covered by the Company\'s DandO; insurance in full force and
effect for the continued benefit of such persons for a continuous period of
not less than two years from the Effective Time on terms that are not
materially different from the Company\'s DandO; insurance currently in effect
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies  
33    of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are not less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time.   (c) In the event the Company, CRI, or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company, CRI or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, or at CRI\'s option, CRI, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.07.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 7.07 shall survive
the consummation of the Merger.   (e) The parties acknowledge that the
provisions of this Section 7.07 are in addition to and not in lieu of the
indemnification obligations of the Company set forth in the agreements listed
in Section 4.23 of the Disclosure Schedule.   SECTION 7.08 Notification of
Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to CRI, and CRI shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which reasonably could be
expected to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (b) any failure of the
Company, CRI, Holdings or Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder, and (c) any other material adverse development (other than changes
in general economic conditions or changes in oil or natural gas prices)
relating to the business, prospects, financial condition or results
of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.08 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.   SECTION 7.09 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.  
(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the Transactions, including, without limitation, using its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as
are necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Offer and the Merger; provided that neither CRI, Purchaser
nor Holdings will be required by this Section 7.09 to take any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other
arrangements, that (a) requires the divestiture of any assets of any of CRI,
Holdings, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or
(b) limits CRI\'s ability to operate, the Company and the Subsidiaries or any
portion thereof or any of CRI\'s or its affiliates\' other assets or
businesses in a manner consistent with past practice. In case, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is   34    necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take all such action.   (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees to
cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and
resist any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Transactions,
including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal.   SECTION 7.10 Public Announcements.
CRI and the Company agree that no public release or announcement concerning
the Transactions, the Offer or the Merger shall be issued by either party
without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United States securities
exchange or national market, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its best efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.   SECTION 7.11 Confidentiality Agreement. Upon the acceptance for
payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be deemed to have terminated without further action by the parties
thereto.   SECTION 7.12 Assumption of Agreements. At the Share Acceptance
Date, CRI shall enter into an assumption or guaranty agreement reasonably
satisfactory to Messrs. Barr and Munden, pursuant to which CRI will assume or
guaranty the obligations of the Company under those certain termination
agreements between the Company and each of Mr. Barr and Mr. Munden each dated
as of August 31, 2001.   ARTICLE VIII  CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

the Effective Time, of the following conditions:   (a) Stockholder
Approval. If and to the extent required by Delaware Law, this Agreement and
the Transactions shall have been approved and adopted by the affirmative vote
of the stockholders of the Company;   (b) No Order. No Governmental
Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and
has the effect of making the acquisition of Shares by CRI, Holdings or
Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or otherwise
restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions;
and   (c) Offer. Purchaser or its permitted assignee shall have
purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer; provided, however, that this condition shall not be applicable to the
obligations of CRI,   35    Holdings or Purchaser if, in breach of this
Agreement or the terms of the Offer, Purchaser fails to purchase any Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.   ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION 9.01 Termination. This Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding any requisite
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the
stockholders of the Company:   (a) by mutual written consent of each of CRI,
Holdings, Purchaser and the Company duly authorized by the Boards of
Directors of CRI, Holdings, Purchaser and the Company; or   (b) by either
CRI, Holdings, Purchaser or the Company if (i) the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or before June 30, 2002; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur
on or before such date or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or
ruling which has become final and nonappealable and has the effect of making
consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger; or   (c) by CRI if (i)
due to an occurrence or circumstance that would result in a failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in Annex A hereto, Purchaser shall have (a)
failed to commence the Offer within 30 days following the date of this
Agreement, (b) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares for
payment thereunder or (c) failed to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer within 90 days following the commencement of the Offer (provided,
however, that the applicable time period specified in (a) and (c) above shall
be extended until June 30, 2002), unless such action or inaction under (a),
(b) or (c) shall have been caused by or resulted from the failure of CRI,
Holdings or Purchaser to perform, in any material respect, any of
their covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or the material
breach by CRI, Holdings or Purchaser of any of their representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement (ii) prior to the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the Board or any committee thereof shall have
withdrawn, modified or failed to make in a manner adverse to CRI, Purchaser
or Holdings its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or
the Merger, or shall have recommended or approved any Acquisition Proposal,
or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing; or   (d) by the Company,
upon approval of the Board, if (i) Purchaser shall have (x) failed to
commence the Offer within seven (7) business days following the date of this
Agreement, or (y) terminated the Offer without having accepted any Shares for
payment thereunder, unless such action or inaction under (x) or (y) shall
have been caused by or resulted from the failure of the Company to perform,
in any material respect, any of its material covenants or agreements  
36    contained in this Agreement or the material breach by the Company of
any of its material representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement, (ii) the Share Acceptance Date has not occurred by January 1, 2002
(but subject to the occurrence of an extension of the Offer pursuant to
Section 2.01 or a Suspension Event), unless such failure of the Share
Acceptance Date to occur shall have been caused by or resulted from the
failure of the Company to perform, in any material respect, any of its
material covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the material
breach by the Company of any of its material representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement, (iii) CRI, Holdings or Purchaser shall have
committed a material breach of this Agreement, or (iv) prior to the Share
Acceptance Date, the Board determines in good faith that it is required to do
so by its fiduciary duties under applicable law after having received advice
from outside legal counsel in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, upon two calendar days\' prior written notice
to CRI setting forth in reasonable detail the identity of the person making,
and the final terms and conditions of, the Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(d)(iv) shall not be effective until the Company has made full payment of
all amounts provided under Section 9.03;  provided, however, that in each
case, the time periods and deadlines in subsection (c) and (d) of this
Section 9.01 may be extended, at the option of either party as reasonably
necessitated by the occurrence of a Suspension Event for such period of time
as may be reasonably necessary (but not to exceed five (5) business days)
following the conclusion of a Suspension Event, but in no event to exceed
January 31, 2002.   SECTION 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto, except (a) as set forth in Section 9.03 and (b) nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for any intentional breach hereof
prior to the date of such termination; provided, however, that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.   SECTION 9.03 Fees.    (a) In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(ii) or 9.01(d)(iv), then, in any such
event, the Company shall pay CRI promptly (but in no event later than one
business day after the first of such events shall have occurred) a fee of
$3,500,000 (the "Fee"), which amount shall be payable in immediately
available funds.   (b) Except as set forth in this Section 9.03, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not any
Transaction is consummated.   (c) In the event that the Company shall fail
to pay the Fee it shall also pay CRI interest on such unpaid Fee, commencing
on the date that the Fee became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., from time to time, in the City of New
York, as such bank\'s Base Rate.   37     SECTION 9.04 Amendment.
Subject to Section 7.03, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made that would reduce the
amount or change the type of consideration into which each Share shall be
converted upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.  
SECTION 9.05 Waiver. Subject to Section 7.03, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own

bound thereby.   ARTICLE X  GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 10.01 Notices.

persons).   SECTION 10.05 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
