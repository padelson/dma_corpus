 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), is entered into as
of the 25th day of September 2020, by and among First Mid Bancshares, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Eval Sub Inc., a Missouri corporation ("
_Merger Sub_ "), LINCO Bancshares, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company as identified on the signature pages hereto (each individually, a
" _Seller_ " and collectively, " _Sellers_ "). Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
and Sellers are each referred to in this Agreement as a " _Party_ " and
collectively in this Agreement as the " _Parties_."

  

  

 **RECITALS**

  

  

WHEREAS, the Parent Board and the Company Board, and the sole shareholder of
Merger Sub, have each approved and declared it advisable and in the best
interests of the Parties and their respective stockholders or unit holders to
effect a reorganization, whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company, in the manner and on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE I (the " _Merger_ "), as a result of which the Company will
be the Surviving Company;

  

  

WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Company will be
merged with and into Parent;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Parties have determined that the Merger will constitute a
"qualified stock purchase" of the Company Common Stock by Parent from Sellers
within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code and may determine prior
to the Closing Date that it is in their mutual best interests to make an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
and any corresponding elections under any applicable state or local Tax law
(the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the Merger;

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Sellers and certain of their Affiliates are entering into Restrictive Covenant
Agreements, as amended or modified from time to time in accordance with their
terms; and

  

  

WHEREAS, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, will be
adopted and approved, by the written consent of the Sellers (the " _Written
Consent_ ") promptly as practicable but not later than twenty-four (24) hours
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  

  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties
and covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

  

1.1  The Merger _._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date and in accordance with the General and
Business Corporation Law of Missouri, as amended (the " _GBCLM_ "), Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the company surviving the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "). Immediately
following the Merger, the Surviving Company shall be merged with and into
Parent. Parent will cause the merger of the Bank with and into the Parent
Bank at a time to be determined by Parent following the Effective Time (the "
_Bank Merger_ "). At the effective time of the Bank Merger, the separate
existence of the Bank will terminate. Parent Bank will be the surviving bank
and will continue its existence under Applicable Law. The Bank Merger shall
be accomplished pursuant to the bank merger agreement in form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_.

  

  

   

| | 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

1.2   _Effective Time_ _._ As of the Closing, the Parties will cause the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri (the " _MO SOS_ ") as
provided in the GBCLM. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time
(referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ") at which the Articles of Merger is
duly filed with the MO SOS, or at such other date and time as is agreed among
the Parties and specified in the Articles of Merger.

  

  

1.3   _Effects of the Merger_ _._ At and as of the Effective Time:

  

  

(a)  as a result of the Merger, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
Merger Sub shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company;

  

  

(b)  the officers of the Surviving Company shall be the officers of Merger
Sub serving immediately prior to the Effective Time, who shall continue in
office for the terms provided in the bylaws of the Surviving Company and until
their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified; and

  

  

(c)  the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions
of the GBCLM and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Merger Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company.

  

  

1.4   _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares_ _._

  

  

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock of the Company,
$1.00 par value per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other than Excluded Shares,
shall be converted into and become the right to receive the following
consideration (and thereupon shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with _Section 1.9(b)_ , the following
consideration) (the consideration described in clauses (i) and (ii)
below, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 1.4(d)_, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "): As set forth on, and in accordance with, _Schedule
1.4(a)_ , the shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive: (i) the aggregate amount of $116,500,000, less the
Special Dividend Amount, in cash without interest allocated among the Sellers
as provided on _Schedule 1.4(a)_ (such aggregate amount of cash less the
Special Dividend Amount is hereinafter referred to as the " _Cash
Consideration_ "), and (ii) an aggregate of 1,262,246 validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $4.00 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (such per share amount, together with
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ , is hereinafter referred to as the " _Parent Stock
Consideration_ ") allocated among the Sellers as provided on _Schedule
1.4(a)_. In accordance with _Section 1.4(d)_ , the Cash Consideration is
subject to adjustment.

  

  

(b)  The holders of any certificates of Company Common Stock (" _Company
Stock Certificates_ ") previously evidencing such shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by law.

  

  

   

| 2| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(c)  If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a dividend
in the form of Parent Common Stock shall be declared with a record date within
such period, then the aggregate number of shares included in the Parent Stock
Consideration will be appropriately and proportionally adjusted so as to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock with the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

  

(d)  In the event the Closing Balance Sheet reflects Consolidated
Stockholders' Equity less than $169,682,102.00 (the " _Minimum Adjusted Net
Worth_ "), for every $50,000.00 shortfall thereof (and not, for the avoidance
of doubt, any portion thereof), the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an
aggregate amount equal to $39,000.00, to be applied pro rata to each share
receiving Cash Consideration as set forth on _Schedule 1.4(a)_. If the
Closing Balance Sheet reflects Consolidated Shareholders' Equity equal to or
greater than the Minimum Adjusted Net Worth, then there will be no adjustment
to the Merger Consideration. As used herein, the term " _Consolidated
Shareholders ' Equity_" shall mean the consolidated shareholders' equity of
the Company reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the following amounts shall be disregarded, and not be taken into
account or otherwise reduce such consolidated shareholders' equity: (i) any
changes to the valuation of the Company's investment portfolio attributed to
ASC 320, whether upward or downward, from June 30, 2020 until the date of the
Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) the aggregate fees and expenses of attorneys,
accountants, consultants, financial advisors and other professional advisors
incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) any amounts paid or
payable to any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any contract, severance arrangement, benefit plan or
employment practice of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and all other
payroll and non-payroll related costs and expenses incurred by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iv) costs associated with the termination of the
Company's employee benefit plans, (v) any costs associated with the
termination of the Company's and Company Subsidiaries' data processing
agreement and other contracts, (vi) any negative provisions for loan losses
taken by the Company from the date of this Agreement until the date of the
Closing Balance Sheet and (vii) any other expenses incurred solely in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case incurred
or to be incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary through the
Effective Time in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
before the Effective Time, the Parties may mutually agree to change the
method of effecting the Merger if and to the extent that they deem such a
change to be desirable; _provided_ , that (i) any such change shall not
affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of
Company Common Stock, and (ii) no such change shall alter or change the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common
Stock as consideration in the Merger or require submission to or approval of
the Company\'s shareholders after the Merger has been approved by the
Company\'s shareholders. If the Parties agree to make such a change, they
shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

  

  

1.5   _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock held as treasury stock or otherwise held by the Company,
if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be
exchanged therefor (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ").

  

  

   

| 3| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

1.6   _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

  

(a)  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize the issuance
of and shall make available to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., Parent's
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
Company Stock Certificates for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ ,
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock, to be issued by book-
entry transfer, for payment of the Parent Stock Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.4(a)(ii)_ , and (ii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
1.7_  Such amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, plus the amount
of Cash Consideration payable to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to
_Section 1.4(a)(i)_ , together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to as the "
_Conversion Fund_ ". Parent shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

  

  

(b)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each Seller a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ").
Each Seller shall properly surrender its respective Company Stock Certificates
for exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed by such Seller (a copy of which will also be
provided to Parent), and shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
Cash Consideration and/or Parent Stock Consideration deliverable in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock
Certificate. At the Effective Time, such Company Stock Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger
Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate. If a
Seller properly surrenders its respective Company Stock Certificates for
exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed by such Seller (a copy of which has also been
provided to Parent), at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall pay to such Seller the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date, and the book-entry transfers for the shares
of Common Stock included in the Parent Stock Consideration issued to the
Sellers shall be effective on the Closing Date.

  

  

(c)  Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to identify the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to _Section 1.4_  with a legend
substantially in the form of the following: "RESTRICTED SECURITIES THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, NOR
QUALIFIED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE, AND WHICH MAY NOT BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS."

  

  

(d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e)  No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_. Promptly after the surrender
of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ , the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.4_. No holder of an
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the
surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Parent
Common Stock into which such holder's Company Common Stock shall have been
converted.

  

  

   

| 4| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(f)  Any portion of the Conversion Fund held by the Exchange Agent that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Company, or its successors in
interest. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with this _ARTICLE I_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company, or
its successors in interest, for the issuance of the Cash Consideration, the
payment of the Parent Stock Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of
any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such shareholders' shares of
Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or
distributions on such Parent Stock Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

  

(g)  In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ , the Cash
Consideration or the Parent Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement,
as applicable.

  

  

1.7   _No Fractional Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued as Parent Stock Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _ARTICLE I_ shall
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to
the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Closing Parent Common
Stock Price by the fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such former holder would otherwise be entitled. " _Closing Parent Common
Stock Price_ " means the weighted average of the daily closing sales prices
of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market for
the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  

  

1.8   _Shareholder Consent_. The Company shall obtain, as soon as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than 11:59 p.m. central time on the first
Business Day after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
irrevocable written consents in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement executed on behalf of all shareholders to adopt and approve this
Agreement as required under the Company's certificate of incorporation, which
shall be in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ (the " _Shareholder
Consent_ ").

  

  

1.9   _Withholding_. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to
any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Company, Parent, or
any Affiliate thereof, or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law.
Parent or the Exchange Agent shall make a good faith effort to provide notice
to the Company of its intent to withhold at least five days in advance of
doing so, provided that Parent and the Exchange Agent shall have the right to
withhold pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ regardless of whether such notice is
provided. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Parent or
the Exchange Agent and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

1.10   _Closing_. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held on the
fifth Business Day following the date on which all of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE VII_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ have been satisfied, or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or on such
other date as the Parties may mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ "). The
Closing shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date at
the offices of Schiff Hardin LLP, 233 S. Wacker Drive, Suite 7100, Chicago,
Illinois, or at such other place and time upon which the Parties may agree.

(a)  The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the Company's
obligations, excluding the Special Dividend, hereunder have been duly and

regulatory approvals described in _Section 3.5_ , will be a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Company, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors

(b)  Subject to receipt of the consents or approvals set forth in _Company

true and complete copies of the following financial statements (collectively,
the " _Company Financial Statements_ "): (a) the consolidated balance sheets
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2019,
and the related statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows for the fiscal years then ended; and (b) the consolidated interim
balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of August 31,
2020 (the " _Interim Balance Sheet_ ") and the related statements of income
and changes in shareholders' equity for the eight month period then ended
(together with the Interim Balance Sheet, the " _Interim Financial Statements_
"). The Company Financial Statements are complete and correct and have been
prepared in conformance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved. Each balance sheet (including any related notes) included
in the Company Financial Statements presents fairly the
consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as of the date thereof, and each income statement (including any related
notes) and statement of cash flow included in the Company Financial Statements
presents fairly the consolidated results of operations and cash flow,
respectively, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the period set
forth therein; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Interim Financial
Statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation, subject
to normal, recurring year-end adjustments (which adjustments will not be,
individually or in the aggregate, material), and lack footnotes. The books,
records and accounts of the Company and each Company Subsidiary accurately and
fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, all transactions and all items of
income and expense, assets and liabilities and accruals relating to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable.

  

  

3.7   _No Undisclosed Liabilities_ _._ Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, or
otherwise, existing or arising out of any transaction or state of
facts existing on or prior to the date hereof, except (a) as and to the
extent disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the Company Financial
Statements, (b) as and to the extent arising under contracts, commitments,
transactions, or circumstances identified in the _Company Disclosure
Schedules_ , excluding any liabilities for breaches thereunder by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary, and (c) liabilities, not material in the aggregate
and incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business, which, under GAAP, would
not be required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared as of the date
hereof. An action taken in the " _Ordinary Course of Business_ " shall mean
an action taken in the ordinary course of business of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary, as applicable, in conformity with past custom and
practice (including with respect to quantity and frequency) and where for
such action to be taken, no separate authorization by the Company Board, the
board of directors of the Bank or managers of any OREO Subsidiary, as
applicable, is required. Any liabilities incurred in connection with
litigation or judicial, administrative or arbitration proceedings or claims
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall not be deemed to be
incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business.

  

  

3.8   _Loans; Loan Loss Reserves_ _._

  

  

(a)  Each outstanding loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing
agreement (including any overdraft protection extensions of credit), any
participation therein and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof
(collectively, " _Loans_ ") reflected on the books and records of the Bank is
evidenced by appropriate and sufficient documentation and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and
remedies generally from time to time in effect and by Applicable Law which may
affect the availability of equitable remedies. No obligor named in any Loan
has provided notice (whether written or, to the Knowledge of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, oral) to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
such obligor intends to attempt to avoid the enforceability of any term of
any Loan under any such laws or equitable remedies, and no Loan is subject to
any valid defense, set-off, or counterclaim that has been threatened or
asserted in writing (or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, oral) with respect to such Loan. All Loans that are
secured, as evidenced by the appropriate and sufficient ancillary security
documents, are so secured by valid and enforceable liens, except to the extent
such validity or enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally from time to time in
effect and by Applicable Law which may affect the availability of
equitable remedies. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
entered into any loan repurchase agreements. There has been no default on, or
forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any Loan made to an executive
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or an entity
controlled (as defined in _Section 10.5_ ) by an executive officer or director
during the three years immediately preceding the date hereof.

  

  

   

| 11| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(b)  The reserves and allowances for loan and lease losses shown on each of
the balance sheets contained in the Company Financial Statements are adequate
in the judgment of management, and consistent with the Bank's internal
policies, applicable regulatory standards and under GAAP, to provide for
losses, net of recoveries relating to loans and leases previously charged off,
on loans and leases outstanding (excluding accrued interest receivable) as of
the applicable date of such balance sheet. The aggregate loan balances of the
Bank in excess of such reserves, in each case as shown on Company Financial
Statements, are, to the Knowledge of the Company and any Company Subsidiary,
collectible in accordance with their terms.

  

  

3.9   _Properties and Assets_.

  

  

(a)   _Real Property_. _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.9(a)_ sets forth a
complete and correct description of all real property owned or leased by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary or in which the Company or a Company
Subsidiary has an interest (other than as a mortgagee) (the " _Real Property_
"). "Real Property" does not include real property (x) held by Bank or any
OREO Subsidiary as a trustee in the ordinary course of its business, or (y)
acquired in foreclosures or in lieu of foreclosures and being held by any
Bank or any OREO Subsidiary for disposition as required by Applicable Law (any
such real property included in clause (y), " _OREO Property_ "). No real
property or improvements are carried on the Bank's or any OREO Subsidiary's
books and records as OREO. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own, or
have a valid right to use or a leasehold interest in, all Real Property used
by them in the conduct of their respective businesses as such businesses are
presently conducted. The ownership or leasehold interest of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in such Real Property is not subject to any mortgage,
pledge, lien, option, conditional sale agreement, encumbrance, security
interest, title exceptions or restrictions or claims or charges of any kind
(collectively, " _Encumbrances_ "), except for Permitted Encumbrances. As
used in this Agreement, " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " shall mean (i)
Encumbrances arising under conditional sales contracts and equipment leases
with third parties under which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is
not delinquent or in default, (ii) carriers', workers', repairers',
materialmen's, warehousemen liens' and similar Encumbrances incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business, (iii) Encumbrances for taxes not yet due and
payable or that are being contested in good faith and for which proper
reserves have been established and reflected on the Company Financial
Statements, (iv) minor exceptions or defects in title to real property or
recorded easements, rights of way, building or use restrictions, covenants or
conditions that in each case do not materially impair the intended use
thereof, (v) zoning and similar restrictions on the use of real property, and

(c)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other event) will cause an increase or acceleration of
benefits or benefit entitlements to employees or former employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan or any other
increase in the liabilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that, to the extent the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby results
in any such item, _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.21(c)_ includes a true and
complete (i) list of each individual receiving a right to any such benefit
and (ii) a description of each such benefit.

  

  

   

| 22| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(d)  Except as set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.21(d)_ , neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary maintains or participates, and has
ever maintained or participated, in (i) a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "); (ii), a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code (a

within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA; or (iv) a pension plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA or the minimum funding requirements of Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary or, to their Knowledge, any director or employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or any fiduciary of any ERISA Plan has engaged in any
transaction in violation of Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) for which no
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(d) of the Code in
connection with such ERISA Plan and which would reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not provide and since January 1, 2018
have not provided medical benefits, life insurance or similar welfare
benefits to former employees, except as required by Section 601 of ERISA.

  

  

(e)  Each ERISA Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 and
related provisions of the Code is the subject of a current favorable
determination letter from the IRS, to the effect that it is qualified under
the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section
501 of the Code (or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are otherwise
relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to the
Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' Knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any ERISA
Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related trust, and such ERISA Plan has
been timely amended to reflect applicable legislation and regulations for
which the remedial amendment period has expired.

  

  

(f)  Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in material compliance
with its terms and with all Applicable Law, rules and regulations, including
ERISA and the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary that is a
fiduciary with respect to any Company Benefit Plan has breached any of the
responsibilities, obligations or duties imposed on it by ERISA. No
Company Benefit Plan is currently the subject of a submission under IRS
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or any similar system, nor under
any DOL amnesty program, and to the Knowledge of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary such submission of any Company Benefit Plan is anticipated.

  

  

(g)  Other than claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business,
there is no litigation, claim, assessment, audit, inquiries or reviews
pending or, to the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' Knowledge,
threatened by, on behalf of, or against any of the Company Benefit Plans or
against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any of the
Company Benefit Plans and, to the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries'
Knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any such litigation, claim or
assessment in each case that could subject the Company or a Company Subsidiary
to a material fine, tax, penalty or liability. Every Company Benefit Plan
fiduciary and official is bonded to the extent required by Section 412 of
ERISA.

  

  

(h)  All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries to any Company Benefit Plan (i) through the date
hereof have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set
aside therefor and reflected in the Company Financial Statements and (ii)

purposes will have been set aside therefor and reflected in the Company
Financial Statements. Except to the extent reserved for and reflected in the
Company Financial Statements in accordance with this subsection (i), none of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has committed to, or announced, a
change to any Company Benefit Plan that increases the cost of the Company
Benefit Plan to the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

(i)  No condition exists as a result of which the Company would have any
liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company Benefit Plan
with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for the
Company as an independent contractor rather than as an employee.

  

  

3.22   _Technology and Intellectual Property_.

copyrights and patents; (ii) applications for registration or grant of any of
the foregoing; (iii) unregistered trademarks, service marks, trade names,

(b)  The Company and each Company Subsidiary has ownership of, or such other
rights by license, lease or other agreement in and to, the Intellectual
Property as is necessary to permit the use of the Intellectual Property in the
conduct of its business as presently conducted. Since January 1, 2015,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice
(whether written or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, oral) alleging that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
infringed or violated any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent, trade
secret right or other proprietary right of others, and to the Knowledge of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has committed any such violation or infringement. To the Knowledge
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, there are no facts or circumstances
that, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, would cause
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to be in any way more restricted in its
use of any of the Intellectual Property than it was on the date hereof under
any contract to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which it is bound, or that use of such Intellectual Property by the Bank will,
as a result of such consummation, violate or infringe the rights of any
Person, or subject Parent, the Company a Company Subsidiary to liability
of any kind, under any such contract.

  

  

(c)  The Company or a Company Subsidiary has ownership of, or such other
rights by license, lease or other agreement in and to, the IT Assets as is
necessary to permit the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to use the IT
Assets in the conduct of their respective businesses as presently conducted.
The IT Assets operate and perform in all material respects in accordance with
their documentation and functional specifications and otherwise as required
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with their
respective businesses, and have not materially malfunctioned or failed within
the past three years. " _IT Assets_ " means the computers, computer software,
firmware, servers, workstations, routers, hubs, switches, data communications
lines and all other information technology equipment, and all associated
documentation, owned or leased by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. To

not contain any worms, viruses, bugs, faults or other devices or effects that
(i) enable or assist any Person to access without authorization the IT Assets,
or (ii) otherwise significantly adversely affect the functionality of the IT
Assets, except as disclosed in its documentation. To the Knowledge of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, no Person has gained unauthorized access
to the IT Assets. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have implemented
reasonable back-up and disaster recovery technology consistent with industry
practices. To the Knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
except for "off the shelf" software licensed by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business, none of the IT
Assets contains any shareware, open source code, or other software the use of
which by the Company to any Company Subsidiary requires disclosure or
licensing of any intellectual property.

condition exists with respect to the business, operations or assets of the

delayed.

reports required to be filed with the Commission under the Securities Act or
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")
(collectively with any amendments thereto, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "),
except to the extent that the failure to file any such Parent SEC Report
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of the Parent SEC
Reports, in each case as of its filing date, or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement (with respect to those Parent SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement), has complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and none of the Parent SEC Reports, when
filed or furnished or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that such failure to
comply or untrue statement or omission would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. None of Parent's subsidiaries are or ever have been required
to file periodic reports with the Commission. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments received
from the Commission with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

  

  

(c)  Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as
required by Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act, and Parent has established
and maintains internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act. Parent has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parent's auditors
and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's
internal controls over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2018, neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has Knowledge of any written complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or its subsidiaries
or their respective internal accounting controls, including any written
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its
subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
which, if true, would constitute a significant deficiency or a material
weakness. Since January 1, 2018, subject to any applicable grace periods, (i)
Parent has been and is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and (ii) Parent has
been and is in compliance with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

  

  

4.6   _Compliance with Laws; Legal Proceedings_ _._

  

  

(a)  Parent and its subsidiaries are each in compliance with all applicable
federal, state, county and municipal laws and regulations (i) that regulate
or are concerned in any way with the ownership and operation of banks or the
business of banking, their holding companies and their subsidiaries or of
acting as a fiduciary, including those laws and regulations relating to the
investment of funds, the taking of deposits, the lending of money, the
collection of interest, the extension of credit and the location and
operation of banking facilities, or (ii) that otherwise relate to or affect
the business or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or the assets
owned, used, occupied or managed by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, except
for such noncompliance which individually or in the aggregate would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and its subsidiaries hold all
material Licenses from all appropriate federal, state or other Governmental
Authorities necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses and the
ownership of their respective assets. None of Parent or its subsidiaries has
received from any federal, state or other Governmental Authority any notice
or communication indicating that Governmental Authority would, and Parent has
no reason to believe any such Governmental Authority would, object to, or
withhold any approval or consent necessary for, the consummation by Parent of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(b)  Except as may be disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, there are no
material claims, actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened or contemplated against or affecting Parent or its
subsidiaries, at law or in equity, or before any federal, state or other
Governmental Authority or any arbitrator or arbitration panel, whether by
contract or otherwise, including any claims, actions, suits or proceedings
that might seek to challenge the validity or propriety of the Merger or
that would affect Parent's ability to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals, and there is no decree, judgment or order or supervisory agreement
of any kind in existence against or restraining Parent or its subsidiaries
from taking any action of any kind in connection with their respective
businesses. Except as may be disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, none of
Parent or its subsidiaries has received from any federal, state or other
Governmental Authority any notice or threat (whether written or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, oral) of any enforcement action, criticism or
recommendation concerning capital, compliance with laws or regulations,
safety or soundness, fiduciary duties or other banking or business practices
that has not been resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of such
Governmental Authority and that would be materially adverse to Parent and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, and Parent has no reasonable basis to believe
that any such enforcement action, criticism or recommendation not
otherwise disclosed herein is contemplated.

  

  

4.7   _Parent Regulatory Reports_ _._ Since December 31, 2018, Parent and its
subsidiaries have filed all material reports, registrations and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, required to be filed with the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Delaware
Secretary of State and any other Governmental Authority or self-regulatory
organization with jurisdiction over any of the activities of Parent or its
subsidiaries (the " _Parent Regulatory Reports_ "), and have paid all fees
and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. As of their
respective dates, the Parent Regulatory Reports complied in all material
respects with the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by
the applicable Governmental Authority with which they were filed and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  

  

4.8   _No Adverse Change_ _._ Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents
or this Agreement, there has not occurred (a) since December 31, 2019, any
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (b) any change, condition,
event, circumstance, fact or other occurrence, whether occurring before or
since December 31, 2019 that may reasonably be expected to have or result in
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No fact or condition exists with respect
to the business, operations or assets of Parent or its subsidiaries which
Parent has reason to believe may cause the Federal Reserve Application or any
of the other regulatory approvals referenced in _Section 7.4_ or _Section
8.4_ to be denied or unduly delayed.

  

  

4.9   _Brokers ' and Finders' Fees_. Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liability (whether incurred, potential, contingent or
otherwise) for brokerage commissions, finders' fees, or like compensation
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.10   _Loans; Loan Loss Reserves_ _._

  

  

(a)  Each outstanding loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing
agreement (including any overdraft protection extensions of credit), any
participation therein and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof
(collectively, " _Parent Loans_ ") reflected on the books and records of
Parent Bank is evidenced by appropriate and sufficient documentation and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies generally from
time to time in effect and by Applicable Law which may affect the
availability of equitable remedies. No obligor named in any Parent Loan has
provided notice (whether written or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Parent
Bank, oral) to Parent or Parent Bank that such obligor intends to attempt to
avoid the enforceability of any term of any Parent Loan under any such laws or
equitable remedies, and no Parent Loan is subject to any valid defense, set-
off, or counterclaim that has been threatened or asserted with respect to such
Parent Loan. All Parent Loans that are secured, as evidenced by the
appropriate and sufficient ancillary security documents, are so secured by
valid and enforceable liens. Neither Parent nor Parent Bank has entered into
any loan repurchase agreements.

  

  

   

| 30| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(b)  The reserves for loan and lease losses shown on each of the balance
sheets contained in the Parent Financial Statements are adequate in the
judgment of management and consistent with applicable regulatory standards and
under GAAP to provide for losses, net of recoveries relating to loans and
leases previously charged off, on loans and leases outstanding (excluding
accrued interest receivable) as of the applicable date of such balance sheet.
The aggregate loan balances of Parent Bank in excess of such reserves, in
each case as shown on Parent Financial Statements, are, to the Knowledge of
Parent and Parent Bank, collectible in accordance with their terms.

  

  

4.11   _Financial Capability_. Parent has a sufficient number of non-
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock to complete the Merger as
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent will have prior to the Effective Time
sufficient funds to pay the Cash Consideration.

  

  

4.12   _Community Reinvestment Act Compliance_ _._ Parent Bank's most recent
Community Reinvestment Act rating was "satisfactory" or better.

  

  

4.13   _No Other Representations or Warranties_ _._ Except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent in this ARTICLE IV, neither
Parent nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent, any of its subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, neither Parent nor any other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty to the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to: (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Parent, any of its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses; or (ii) except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this ARTICLE IV, any
oral or written information presented to the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives in the course of their due diligence
investigation of Parent, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the
course of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person has made or is making
any express or implied representation or warranty other than those contained
in ARTICLE II and ARTICLE III.

(a)  The Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives full access,
during normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice to the Company,
to further information (to the extent permissible under Applicable Law) and
the Company's and Company Subsidiaries' premises for purposes of (i)

operations and to consult with their officers and employees regarding the same
on an ongoing basis to verify compliance by the Company and the Company

preparations for conversion of the Bank's IT Assets; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing actions shall not (x) unduly interfere with the business

product or other legal privilege (provided, however, that the Company shall

the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed, furnished or received by it during such period pursuant
to the requirements of federal and state banking laws or federal or state
securities laws, and a copy of each report filed by it or any Company
Subsidiaries with any Governmental Authority; in each case other than
portions of such documents relating to confidential supervisory or examination
materials or the disclosure of which would violate any Applicable Law. The
Company shall also provide, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to
provide, to Parent all information provided to the board of directors of such
Persons, or to the members of such board's committees, in connection with all
meetings of such board of directors or committees thereof, or otherwise

reports or other analysis prepared for senior management of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; in each case other than portions of such documents: (1)
relating to confidential supervisory or examination materials, (2)
the disclosure of which would violate any Applicable Law, or (3) the
disclosure of which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company's
outside counsel, result in the waiver of the attorney-client privilege.

  

  

(b)  Parent will use such information as is provided to it by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, or Representatives thereof, solely for the purpose
of conducting business, legal and financial reviews of the Company and the

Federal Reserve Application and Parent and the Company shall take, and the
Company shall cause the Bank to take, all other appropriate actions necessary
to obtain the regulatory approvals referred to in _Section 7.4_ or _Section

shall not be construed as including an obligation to accept any terms of or
conditions to a consent, authorization, order, or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Authority or other party that are not
acceptable to such Party, in its sole reasonable discretion, or to change the
business practices of such Party or any of its subsidiaries in a manner not
acceptable to such Party, in its sole reasonable discretion. In advance of
filing any application for such regulatory approval, each Party shall
provide, or the Company shall cause the Bank to provide, the other Parties and
their counsel with a copy of such application (but excluding any information
contained therein regarding Parent and its business or operations for which
confidential treatment has been requested) and provide an opportunity to
comment thereon, and thereafter shall promptly advise the other Parties and
their counsel of any material communication received by such Party or the
Bank or its counsel from any Governmental Authority with respect to such
application.

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

5.6   _Loan Charge-Off; Pre-Closing Loan Review_ _._

  

  

(a)  The Company shall cause the Bank, prior to the Closing Date, (i) to
write off all Loans of the Bank that are required to be written off by the
Bank's regulators or that, in conformity with past practices and policies of
the Bank and GAAP, should be written off as Loan losses and (ii) to write
down potential Loan losses in conformity with past practices and policies of
the Bank and GAAP. Any such write down shall not have any effect on, or be
deemed to result in a breach of, the representations and warranties under
_Section 3.8_ made by the Company as of the date of this Agreement and shall
not be deemed to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, but shall be taken into account in determining the
Consolidated Shareholders' Equity for purposes of _Section 1.4(d)_ ; and
nothing in this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall require the Company to make any
additional provision to the Bank's reserve for loan losses.

  

  

(b)  The Company shall cause the Bank to make available to Parent the files
maintained by the Bank with respect to, and information regarding the status
of, each Loan contained in the Loan portfolio of the Bank, as of a date not

5.7   _Director and Officer Insurance Coverage_ _._ Parent agrees to provide
each of the directors, officers, members or trustees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who continue to hold such positions after the Effective
Time substantially the same insurance coverage against personal liability for
actions and omissions prior to the Effective Time no less favorable than that
which is provided to current directors and officers of Parent and its
subsidiary bank. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall procure and maintain (so long
as the premium or premiums do not exceed 350% of the amount of the average
annual premium paid by the Company for the current three year term for such
purpose) for the benefit of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(including their respective successors) and individuals who were officers,
directors, members or trustees of the Company or Company Subsidiaries (but
only in their capacity as such) immediately prior to Closing, a tail policy
or policies covering a period of six years following the Effective Time
and providing coverages equivalent to the level and scope of directors' and
officers' liability and other professional insurance coverages as set forth
in the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' current directors' and
officers' liability and other professional insurance policies in effect as of
the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and regardless
of the purchase of insurance coverage under this _Section 5.7_ , Parent

applicable state and local Tax laws. The Parties agree not to take or

_Section 5.9(b_ ) through _(e)_ of this Agreement shall apply only if the
Parties agree prior to the Closing Date to make Section 338(h)(10) Election

mentioned Party in connection with Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall
consider in good faith all reasonable comments from such other Party. Each
Party agrees that it shall not revoke or permit to be revoked the Section

Law).

  

  

(e)  As soon as commercially practicable following the Closing Date, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on an allocation
of the Purchase Price and any other items constituting consideration for
applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent known at such time) among the
assets of the Company in a manner materially consistent with Sections 338 and
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Allocation_ ") and to share with each other such information that is
obtained or in their possession and is reasonably requested by the other Party
as being necessary for the Allocation. If the Parties are unable to agree on
an Allocation within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the

Allocation shall be materially consistent with the Code, Treasury
Regulations. Following the earlier of the Parties' agreement on the Allocation

to, report consistently with the Allocation in all Tax Returns, including IRS

shall take any position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the
Allocation, as adjusted, in each case, unless required to do so by a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. The Parties agree to
promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any Tax
audit, controversy or litigation related to allocation of the Purchase Price
and any other items constituting consideration for applicable income Tax
purposes.

(including any Employee who is absent from work with the Company or a Company
Subsidiary due to a leave of absence (including under the Family and Medical
Leave Act of 1993, as amended)) to become eligible for and entitled to
participate in Parent's benefit plans on the Closing Date and on the same
terms and subject to the same conditions as all other similarly-situated
employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. To the extent Employees participate
in any Parent benefit plans, Parent shall cause the Employees to be given
credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the plan
year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such Parent benefit plan for the
plan year in which the Closing occurs. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition limitations (as
administered in accordance with Applicable Law) under Parent's medical benefit
plans to be waived to the extent such conditions have been waived under the
Company Benefit Pans that provide health insurance benefits. For purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in and, where applicable, vesting
under Parent's 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, short-
term disability plans, vacation policy and severance plan (and the amount of
vacation and severance benefits), each Employee shall receive past service
credit for his or her prior employment with the Company or Company Subsidiary
as if such Employee had then been employed by Parent, except to the extent
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or is not taken
into account under an analogous Company Benefit Plan. Subject to remaining
compliant with its obligations set forth in this _Section 6.1(a)_ ,
Parent reserves the right to change or terminate its employee benefit plans
at any time. In addition to the foregoing, Parent agrees that Bank's 2021 MIP
will not be terminated at Closing and that Parent will cause the participants
under the 2021 MIP to receive payment in accordance with its terms.
Furthermore, Parent agrees that the Bank\'s Commercial Lending Incentive Plan
(" _CLIP_ ") will not be terminated at Closing and that Parent will cause the
participants under the CLIP to receive any previously earned Incentive Award
(as defined in the CLIP) that has been subject to the 12-month deferral under
the CLIP.

Benefit Plans set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 6.1(c)(ii)_.
The Company shall deliver to Parent, at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, evidence that the Company Board has taken, or will take prior
to the Closing Date, the necessary corporate action to terminate such
participation or such Company Benefit Plans, as applicable (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), effective no
later than the Closing Date, and where necessary such termination action
shall provide for settlement and distribution of benefits in accordance with
the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).

  

  

(d)  Except for the 401(k) plan described in the following sentence and the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 6.1(d)_ ,
neither the Parent nor any Company or any Company Subsidiary shall assume, or
have any liability with respect to, any Company Benefit Plan, provided that
following the Closing, the Parent shall retain the right to amend or terminate
the Company Benefit Plans listed on _Company Disclosure Schedule 6.1(d)_ at
any time. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) establish the
LINCO Bancshares, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _LINCO 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii)
cause EPL II, LLC to transfer from the EPL II, LLC 401(k) Plan to the LINCO
401(k) Plan the accounts of current and former Employees. The Company
shall deliver to Parent, at least five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, evidence that the Company Board has taken the necessary action to
establish the LINCO 401(k) Plan and effectuate the transfer of the accounts
described in clause (ii) above to the LINCO 401(k) Plan, effective no later
than the Closing Date.

  

  

(e)  Effective as of the Closing Date, Parent shall be responsible and liable
to provide, or cause one of Parent's Affiliates to provide, continued group
health coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code and any applicable state
statutes mandating health insurance continuation coverage (" _Continuation
Coverage_ ") under a health care plan of Parent or one of Parent's Affiliates
for any current employee (including any employee on a leave of absence as of
the Closing Date) or former employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, who is a "MandA qualified beneficiary," as defined in Treasury
Regulation §54.4980B-9, arising from the Merger or Bank Merger. Parent shall

to which plan any Employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of
employment within twelve months after the Closing Date will receive severance
pay in accordance with the severance pay schedule set forth on
_Schedule 6.1(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Employee eligible to
receive severance benefits under an employment or other agreement shall be
entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this _Section
6.1(f)_. In connection with the foregoing, the Employees eligible to
participate in the severance policy described in this _Section 6.1(f)_ shall
receive service credit for years of continuous service with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for purposes of determining the amount of any
severance pay under such policy.

ability of Company or Company Subsidiary to amend, modify, terminate, or
adopt any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, contract, agreement
or arrangement, (ii) confer on any Person any right to employment or service
or continued employment or service or any term or condition of employment or
service, or (iii) limit Company or Company Subsidiary right to terminate the

illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger, or
if any application, filing or notice for a Requisite Regulatory Approval has
been withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the applicable
Governmental Authority, unless, in each case, the failure to obtain a

agreements of such party set forth herein;

  

  

(ii)  if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before September
30, 2021 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right

untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ would

of its covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set forth in

untrue or incorrect such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ would
not be satisfied, or (B) there has been a breach on the part of the Company
of any of its covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set

 **Section 2.1 General Transfer Restrictions**. The right of any Holder to
Transfer any Shares held by it is subject to the restrictions set forth below.

  

  

(a) Each Holder acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under
the Securities Act and may not be Transferred except pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. Each Holder covenants that the
Shares will only be disposed of pursuant to an effective registration
statement under, and in compliance with the requirements of, the Securities
Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with any applicable
state and foreign securities laws. In connection with any Transfer of the
Shares other than a Transfer (i) pursuant to an effective registration
statement, (ii) to the Company or (iii) pursuant to Rule 144, the Company may
require the Holder to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by
the Holder thereof and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and
substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, to the effect that such Transfer does not require registration under
the Securities Act.

  

  

(b) Each Holder agrees to the affixing, so long as is required by this
Section 2.1, of the following legend on any certificate or book-
entry position evidencing any of the Shares:

  

  

 **RESTRICTED SECURITIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, NOR QUALIFIED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE,
AND WHICH MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN ABSENCE OF
SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH
LAWS.**

  

  

Certificates or book-entry positions evidencing the Shares shall not be
required to contain such legend or any other legend (i) following any sale of
such Shares pursuant to an effective registration statement (including the
Registration Statement described in Section 3.1) covering the resale of the
Shares, (ii) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to Rule 144 or if the
Shares are transferrable by a Person who is not an Affiliate of the
Company or the applicable Holder pursuant to Rule 144 without any volume or
manner of sale restrictions thereunder, (iii) if Holder is not an Affiliate
of the Company, six (6) months following the Closing, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of (i), (ii) and (iii), above, the Holder provides the
Company with customary legal representation letters reasonably acceptable to
the Company or (iv) if the Holder provides the Company with a legal opinion
reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that the legend is not
required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act. Whenever such
restrictions shall cease and terminate as to any Shares, the Holder of such
securities shall be entitled to receive from the Company upon a written
request in writing, without expense, new securities of like tenor not bearing
the legend set forth herein, and such new securities shall be issued
promptly, but in no event less than five (5) Business Days after a written
request to remove such legends.

 **REGISTRATION AND PROCEDURES**

  

  

 **Section 3.1 S-3 Registration**.

  

  

(a) In compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (or such other
form that the Company is then eligible to use if not eligible to use Form S-3)
covering the resale as a secondary offering to be made on a continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 of all Registrable Securities. The registration statement
(or new registration statement) required to be filed pursuant to this Section
3.1, amendments and supplements to such registration statement, including
post-effective amendments, all exhibits and all materials incorporated by
reference in such registration statement other than a registration statement
on Form S-4 or S-8, is referred to herein as the " **Registration
Statement**."

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) but in any event not more than (x) five (5) Business Days
following the Company's filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (the **" 2020 10-K**"), or (y) five (5)
Business Days following the Closing Date if such date is after the date
the Company files the 2020 10-K, the Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement registering the resale of the Registrable
Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to
file a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or, if a
Registration Statement has been filed but not declared effective by the SEC,
request effectiveness of such Registration Statement, if during any such time
that (i) the Company's insider trading policy would prohibit directors or
executive officers of the Company from trading in the Company's securities,
(ii) the Company otherwise is in a "blackout" period in which the Company is
prohibited from registering any securities for its own account or that of any
other existing or prospective stockholder or trading in the Company's
securities, or (iii) audited financial statements as of a date other than the
fiscal year end of the Company would be required to be prepared and, in the
case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the time periods with respect to
filing or effectiveness thereof shall be tolled correspondingly;  _provided_
, _further_ , that the Company shall not be required, if a Registration
Statement has been filed but not declared effective by the SEC, to request
effectiveness of such Registration Statement until any financial statements
that are required to be filed with the SEC by the Company related to the
Merger in accordance with Item 2.01 of Form 8-K are so filed, and the
time periods with respect to effectiveness thereof shall be tolled
correspondingly. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing and to
keep the Registration Statement continuously effective as promptly as
practical and in compliance with the Securities Act and usable for resale of
Registrable Securities covered thereby from the date of its initial
effectiveness (the " **Initial Effectiveness Date** ") until three (3) years
following the Initial Effectiveness Date (such period, the " **Effectiveness
Period** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Company to maintain any Registration Statement once all
Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without
any limitation as to manner-of-sale restrictions or volume limitations.

  

  

(c) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to
take any action pursuant to Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 with respect to
Registrable Securities of a Holder that the Holder shall furnish to the
Company such information regarding such Holder as required under Section
3.4(a).

  

  

   

| 5| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(d) Holders shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and reasonably
comment on the Registration Statement prior to filing. The Plan of
Distribution in the Registration Statement shall include provisions customary
for resales by selling shareholders, including that sales may be effected in
transactions described in Question 6 of Exhibit B.

  

  

 **Section 3.2 Registration Procedures; Company Obligations**. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration of the
Registrable Securities in accordance with Section 3.1, and in connection
therewith shall have the following obligations:

  

  

(a) No later than the first (1st) Business Day after the Registration
Statement becomes effective, the Company shall file with the SEC the final
prospectus included therein pursuant to Rule 424. The Registration Statement,
including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or
any amendments or supplements thereto, shall comply as to form and content
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made (in the case
of any prospectus), not misleading.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 3.2(h), the Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and the
prospectus used in connection with the Registration Statement and timely file
and incorporate by reference such Company reports filed under the Exchange
Act as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective and
usable for resale of the Registrable Securities covered thereby at all times
during the Effectiveness Period. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement that is not effective upon filing to become effective as soon as
practicable after such filing. No later than the first (1st) Business Day
after a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement becomes
effective, the Company shall file with the SEC the final prospectus or
prospectus supplement included therein pursuant to Rule 424.

  

  

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify the Holders of the
time when the Registration Statement becomes effective or an amendment or
supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such Registration Statement has
been filed. The Company shall furnish to the Holders, without charge, such
documents, including copies of any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained in the Registration Statement or any amendments or supplements
thereto, and such other documents as such Holder may reasonably request from
time to time in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement. The Company shall
reasonably cooperate with the Holders in connection with the disposition of
such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, including
with respect to the removal of stop transfer orders and restrictive legends on
Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement.

  

  

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify, and cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by
the Registration Statement in connection with the registration or
qualification of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the
securities or "blue sky" laws of each state and other jurisdiction of the
United States as any such Holder reasonably requests in writing, and do any
and all other things reasonably necessary or advisable to keep such
registration or qualification in effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or take any action which would
subject it to taxation or general service of process in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject.

  

  

   

| 6| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(e) The Company shall promptly notify (which notice shall be accompanied by
an instruction to suspend the use of the prospectus) the Holders when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act of the happening of any event as a result of which any prospectus
included in, or relating to, the Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material,
non-public information), and, subject to Section 3.2(h), promptly prepare and
file with the SEC a supplement to the related prospectus or amendment to such
Registration Statement or any other required document so that, as thereafter
delivered to the Holders, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

(f) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the
Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or
suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension as
soon as reasonably practicable and to notify the Holders of the issuance of
such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

  

  

(g) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be (1) listed
on the Nasdaq Global Market during the Effectiveness Period and (2) reflected
in the stock ledger maintained by the Company's transfer agent.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the Registration Statement becomes effective the Company may delay the
disclosure of material, non-public information concerning the Company or any
of its subsidiaries if the Board of Directors of the Company has a valid
business reason for determining that disclosure of such information is not in
the best interests of the Company and such disclosure is not otherwise
required (a " **Grace Period** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall promptly (i) provide written notice to the Holders of the Grace Period
(provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material, non-public
information) and the date on which the Grace Period will begin, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate a Grace Period as promptly as
possible; and (iii) provide written notice to the Holders of the date on
which the Grace Period ends; _provided_ , _further_ , that (1) the Company
shall not register any securities for its own account or that of any other
existing or prospective stockholder or permit the Company's officers and
directors to trade in the Company's shares during such Grace Period and (2)
the Effectiveness Period shall be extended by the aggregate number of days in
all Grace Periods during the Effectiveness Period. The provisions of Section
3.2(e) shall not be applicable during any Grace Period. Upon expiration of a
Grace Period, the Company shall again be bound by the provisions of Section
3.2(e) with respect to the information giving rise thereto unless such
material, non-public information is no longer applicable.

  

  

   

| 7| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

 **Section 3.3 Current Public Information**. During the Effectiveness Period,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make and keep
public information available, as those terms are defined in Rule 144, until
all the Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable Securities, and so
long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such Holder upon
request a written statement by the Company as to its satisfaction of the
current public information requirements of Rule 144 and (ii) file with the SEC
in a timely manner all reports and other documents required to be filed by
the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

  

  

 **Section 3.4 Obligations of the Holders**.

  

  

(a) Each Holder shall furnish in writing to the Company such information
regarding such Holder, the Registrable Securities held by such Holder and the
intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities held by such
Holder as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such
Registrable Securities and shall execute, or shall cause to be executed, such
customary documents in connection with such registration as the Company may
reasonably request. In connection therewith, upon the execution of
this Agreement, each Holder shall complete, execute and deliver to the
Company a selling securityholder notice and questionnaire in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
first anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement, the Company
shall notify each Holder of any additional information the Company requires
from such Holder, and such Holder shall provide such information to the
Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the first anticipated
filing date of the Registration Statement.

  

  

(b) Each Holder agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested
by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement.

  

  

(c) Upon receipt of written notice from the Company of any event of the kind
described in Section 3.2(e) or Section 3.2(f) or written notice of any Grace
Period, each Holder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable
Securities until such Holder has received copies of a supplemented or amended
prospectus or until such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the
use of the prospectus may be resumed or that the Grace Period has ended. If
so directed by the Company, such Holder shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to return to the Company (at the Company's expense) all
copies of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the
time of receipt of such notice other than permanent file copies then in such
Holder's possession.

  

  

(d) No Holder shall use any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405)
in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities without the prior
written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(e) Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it or an
exemption therefrom in connection with sales of Registrable Securities
pursuant to any Registration Statement.

 **Section 3.5 Expenses of Registration**. All Registration Expenses incurred
in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance hereunder
shall be borne by the Company. All Selling Expenses in connection with the
sale of any Registrable Securities shall be borne by the Holder(s)
selling such Registrable Securities.

  

  

 **Section 3.6 Transfer of Registration Rights**. With respect to any
Transfer of Registrable Securities by a Holder to a Permitted Transferee in
accordance with Article II, the rights of such Holder contained in this
Agreement as to such Shares Transferred may be assigned or otherwise conveyed
by such Holder to the Permitted Transferee provided that the Permitted
Transferee agrees with the Company in writing to be bound by this
Agreement with respect to such Shares, in which case such Permitted
Transferee shall thereafter be a "Holder" hereunder in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

 **ARTICLE IV**

  

  

 **INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION**

  

  

 **Section 4.1 Indemnification**. In the event any Registrable Securities are
included in the Registration Statement:

  

  

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable
Securities and such Holder's officers, directors, employees, partners,
members, agents (including brokers), representatives and Affiliates and each
Person, if any, who Controls such Holder within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act (each, a " **Holder Indemnitee** "), against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel) to which they may become subject, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or reasonable expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following
statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a " **Violation** "): (i)
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in the Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any
documents incorporated therein by reference, (ii) an omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made (in the case of any prospectus), not misleading, and
(iii) a violation or alleged violation by the Company or its agents of the
Securities Act, Exchange Act or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other federal or state law, rule or
regulation applicable to the Company or its agents or Affiliates in
connection with the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement, and the Company will pay to each such Holder
Indemnitee, as accrued, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by he,
she or it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability, action or expense to the extent that any such expense is
not paid under (i), (ii) or (iii) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnification contained in this Section 4.1(a) shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or
expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), nor shall the Company be liable for any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, action or expense to the extent that it arises out of or is based
upon a Violation which occurs (A) in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished by a Holder to the Company, (B) in connection
with any failure of such Person to deliver or cause to be delivered a
prospectus made available by the Company in a timely manner, (C) in
connection with any offers or sales effected by or on behalf of any Holder
Indemnitee in violation of Section 3.4(c) of this Agreement, or (D) as a
result of offers or sales effected by or on behalf of any Holder Indemnitee
by means of a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405) that was not
authorized in writing by the Company. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any
such Holder Indemnitee, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by
such Holder, and any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

   

| 9| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(b) Each Holder, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and each of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates and Persons, if any, who Control the Company
within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, a "
**Company Indemnitee** "), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses to which any of the Company Indemnitees may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any (i) untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact regarding such Holder and provided in writing by
such Holder which is contained in the Registration Statement, including any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any
amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made (in the case of any prospectus), not misleading, in each case to the
extent (and only to the extent) that such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration
Statement, preliminary or final prospectus, amendment or supplement thereto,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such
Holder to the Company, (iii) a violation or alleged violation by a Holder of
any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act applicable to such Holder and relating to action or inaction required of
such Holder in connection with the registration of such Holder's Registrable
Securities or (iv) in connection with any offer or sales effected by or on
behalf of such Holder in violation of Section 3.4(c) of this Agreement, and
such Holder, on a several basis, will pay, as accrued, any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by any Company Indemnitee pursuant to this
Section 4.1(b), in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability, action or expense as a result of such Holder's
untrue statement or omission or violation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnification contained in this Section 4.1(b) shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or
expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount any Holder will be obligated to
pay pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) and Section 4.2 will be limited to an
amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such Holder for the
sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
which gives rise to such obligation to indemnify and/or contribute (less the
aggregate amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required
to pay in respect of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense or any
substantially similar loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense arising from
the sale of such Registrable Securities). Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any
such Company Indemnitee, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by
such Holder, and any termination of this Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 

    

  

(c) Promptly after receipt by a party to this Agreement entitled to indemnity
hereunder (an " **Indemnified Party** ") under this Section 4.1 of notice of
the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such
Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
any party to this Agreement from whom indemnification may be sought under this
Section 4.1 (an " **Indemnifying Party** "), deliver to the Indemnifying
Party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnifying
Party so desires, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly
noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that an Indemnified Party
(together with all other Indemnified Parties which may be represented without
conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel,
with the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party, if (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to
assume the defense of such claim within seven (7) days after receipt of
notice of the claim and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, as the case may be; or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, representation of such Indemnified
Party by such counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests (including the availability of differing legal defenses)
between such Indemnified Party and any other party represented by
such counsel in such proceeding. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party
shall not, in connection with any proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be
liable for fees or expenses of more than one separate counsel at any time for
all such Indemnified Parties. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party in connection with any negotiation or defense of
any such action or claim by the Indemnifying Party and shall furnish to the
Indemnifying Party all information reasonably available to the
Indemnified Party which relates to such action or claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No
Indemnifying Party will, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that includes a
finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights
of any Person or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect of such action or claim. No
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or
proceeding effected without its prior written consent; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or
condition its consent. The failure to deliver written notice to the
Indemnifying Party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such
action shall not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any liability to the
Indemnified Party under this Section 4.1, except to the extent such failure
to give notice has a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to defend such action.

  

  

 **Section 4.2 Contribution**. If the indemnification provided for in Section
4.1 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or
expense referred to therein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the
one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage,
or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by
the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount any Holder will be
obligated to severally and not jointly contribute pursuant to this Section
4.2, together with Holder's liability under Section 4.1(b), will be
limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by a Holder
for the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement which gives rise to such obligation to contribute and/or indemnify
(less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise
been required to pay in respect of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or
expense or any substantially similar loss, liability, claim, damage, or
expense arising from the sale of such Registrable Securities). No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution hereunder from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Registration Rights Agreement. Such Registrable Securities may be sold in one
or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time
of sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale or at negotiated
prices. Such sales may be effected in transactions (which may involve crosses
or block transactions) (i) on any national securities exchange or

resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction, (vi)
purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for
its account, (vii) an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of

shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price
per share, (xi) a combination of any such methods of sale, and (xii) any
other method permitted pursuant to applicable law not involving hedging or
short sales (provided that the Selling Holder may sell securities short and
redeliver Registrable Securities to close out such short positions and may
enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage
in short sales of the securities and deliver Registrable Securities to close
out such short positions). The Selling Holder may pledge or grant a
security interest in some or all of the Registrable Securities owned by it
and, if it defaults in the performance of its security obligations, the
pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the Registrable Securities from
time to time pursuant to the prospectus. The Selling Holder also may transfer
and donate the Registrable Securities in other circumstances in which case the
transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the
Selling Holder for purposes of this prospectus.
