The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



    



 



    

Article 1 
 THE OFFER

  



  

Section 1.01.   _The Offer_.

  



  

(a)  Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article 8, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than 10 business days
after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely
provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to Sections
1.01(e) and 1.02(b)), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Sections 2.05(a)(i) and 2.05(a)(ii) (collectively, the "

the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of Tax in
accordance with Section 2.06(e).

  



  

(b)  Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to (and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements) of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_
(collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), and no other conditions. The Offer
shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition,
the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the amount of cash constituting the Offer
Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition (to the extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements) and (iii) make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent
and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer (provided that nothing herein shall limit
the ability of Parent and Purchaser to increase the cash consideration payable
in the Offer), (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in _clause (e)_
or _(g)_ of Annex I, (F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of
the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, (G)
terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration
Date, in each case, except as provided in Sections 1.01(c) or __1.01(d) or
(H) provide any "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof)
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled
Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article 8.

  



  

(c)  Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date
that is 20 business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule
14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) following the Offer Commencement Date
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent date to which
the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties'
respective termination rights under Article 8: (i) if, as of the then-

  



    

2

 



    

scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied (unless such
condition is waivable by Purchaser or Parent and has been waived)
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer for
additional periods of up to 10 business days per extension, to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for any period
required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC,
the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Purchaser (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond
the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 8 and (y) the End Date (such earlier occurrence, the
" _Extension Deadline_ ") or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the
Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

(d)  Termination of Offer. Nothing in this Section 1.01 shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 8. In the
event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Article 8,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately,
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any
Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
immediately return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(e)  Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that
will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, form of the
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, (ii) make all
deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act and (iii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause
the Offer Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to (x)
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied
by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or
its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser
further agree to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parent's legal counsel all information concerning the Acquired Companies and
the Company's stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.01(e). The Company
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent
and Purchaser agree to provide the

Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments (including
oral comments).

  



  

(f)  Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, Parent shall
cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(g)  Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(h)  Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable
by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the Offer
Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i)
immediately after the Expiration Date irrevocably accept for payment all
Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of
such acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) as promptly as
practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (and in any event within three
business days) pay for such Shares.

  



  

Section 1.02.   _Company Actions_.

  



  

(a)  Schedule 14D-9. Subject to Section 6.01(b), as promptly as practicable
on the Offer Commencement Date, following the filing of the Offer Documents,
the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that
shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and include the fairness
opinion of the Company's financial advisor referenced in Section 3.23 and the
notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and
(ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record
date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of
the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (x)
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements and (y) not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available to the Company or the Company's legal counsel all
information concerning Parent or Purchaser that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.02(a).
Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any response to any comments
(including oral

  



    

4

 



    

comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to
any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide
Parent and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral
comments).

  



  

(b)  Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof
furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer
and the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom
the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, which date
shall not be more than 10 business days prior to the date the Offer Documents
and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_
"). Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and their
agents shall hold in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement the information contained in any such labels, listings and files.

  



  

(c)  Share Registry. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment
by Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

  



  

(i)  any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company
(or held in the Company's treasury) shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(ii)  any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent,
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(iii)  except as provided in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above and subject to
__Section 2.05(b), each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any

  



    

6

 



    

Dissenting Shares, which shall have only those rights set forth in __Section
2.07) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), in each case without any interest thereon, subject
to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with __Section 2.06(e); and

  



  

(iv)  each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, subject to
this __Section 2.05(a), all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with __Section
2.06.

  



  

(b)  If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

Section 2.06.   _Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Offer
Price to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 1.01(b) and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders
of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.05. Promptly after
(and in any event no later than the third business day after) the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate
Offer Price payable pursuant to Section 1.01(h). On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.05 (together with the amount deposited pursuant the
immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price
in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger. The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent if so directed by the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall be (w) in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, (y) in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding one billion dollars, or (z) in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three months. To the extent Parent becomes aware that (i) there are any
losses with respect to any such investments or (ii) the Payment Fund has
diminished for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
make prompt cash payment pursuant to Section 1.01(h) and Section 2.05, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is, at all times during the duration of the Payment Fund, maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments pursuant to
Section 1.01(h) and Section 2.05.

(b)  Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.05, (A) a form of
letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.06(f), if
applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agent's message in respect to
Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to Section 2.05. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with Section 2.06(f), if applicable) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in the case of Certificates,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such transfer or other similar Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes
described in this Section 2.06(b) under any circumstance. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.06(b), each Certificate
and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 2.05.

  



  

(c)  At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, Parent shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (with
respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to Section 2.05) which had been made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered
in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or

  



    

8

 



    

become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the
Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(d)  At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

  



  

(e)  Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser,
and their Affiliates, the Paying Agent or the Depository Agent, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under any Legal
Requirement with respect to Taxes. Any amounts so deducted and withheld and
paid over to the applicable Governmental Body in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made.

  



  

(f)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder,
claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the
Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to Section 2.06(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article 2.

  



  

Section 2.07.   _Dissenters ' Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their
respective demands for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be automatically cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to
exist and shall be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder's Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted
or withheld pursuant to Section 2.06(e)), and such Shares shall not be deemed
to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct
and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands, and the

  



    

9

 



    

Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and Purchaser,
settle or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any such
demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands or agree or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 2.08.   _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised, whether or not vested (including any Company Option subject to
performance-based vesting conditions) and which has a per share exercise price
that is less than the Merger Consideration, shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (i) the excess of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price payable per Share under such
Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, at the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding
and unexercised, whether or not vested and which has a per share exercise
price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, shall be
cancelled without additional consideration.

  



  

(b)  At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is then outstanding,
whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by
(ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than the second payroll date following the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation
shall, pay the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.08(a) and Section
2.08(b), net of any applicable withholding Taxes, to the holders of Company
Options and Company RSUs through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving
Corporation's payroll.

  



    

  

(d)  Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
that are necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements
pursuant to which Company Options and Company RSUs are outstanding or
otherwise) to effect the transactions described in this Section 2.08.

  



  

Section 2.09.   _Further Action_. The Parties agree to take all necessary
action to cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with this
Article 2 as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer
without a meeting of the Company's stockholders, as provided in Section
251(h) of the DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

securities of the Company registered under the Securities Act. No Subsidiary
of the Company owns any Shares.

Section 3.04.   _Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement_. The Company has
the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The Board
of Directors has (a) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interest of,
the Company and its stockholders, (b) declared it advisable to enter into
this Agreement, (c) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Offer and the Merger, (d) resolved that the Merger shall be effected
under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and (e) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, which resolutions, subject to Section 6.01,
have not been subsequently withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent
as of the date of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company, and assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company and is enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights, and by general equitable principles. If the Merger is
consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL as contemplated
hereby, no vote of the Company's stockholders or any holder of Shares is
necessary to authorize or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions, assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in
Section 4.08.

  



  

Section 3.05.   _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a)  Since January 1, 2019, the Company has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such amendment
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the date
of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the
Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2001,
as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to those Company
SEC Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b)  The financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ")

  



    

13

 



    

  

applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may
be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly
presented, in all material respects, the financial position of the Acquired
Companies as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations
and cash flows of the Acquired Companies for the periods covered thereby
(subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to the absence of
notes and to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material).

    



  

(c)  The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act), which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and
procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Acquired Companies; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board
of Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
of the Acquired Companies that could have a material effect on its financial
statements. The Company's management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of the Company's system of internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and, except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
that assessment concluded that those controls were effective. To the
knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2020, neither the Company nor the
Company's independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware
of: (1) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or
operation of the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the
Company, which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information; or (2) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management or other
employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

  



  

(d)  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
and required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in
the Company's reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in compliance in all
material respects with all current listing and corporate governance
requirements of NASDAQ.

  



  

(e)  No Acquired Company is a party to, nor does it have any obligation or
other commitment to become a party to, "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the
Acquired Companies in the Company SEC Documents.

  



    

14

 



    

(f)  As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no
inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending
or threatened in writing, in each case regarding any accounting practices of
the Company, except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

 CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Section 5.01.   _Access and Investigation_.

  



  

(a)  During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
8 (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), upon reasonable advance notice to the
Company, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, provide Parent and Parent's Representatives with
reasonable

access during normal business hours of the Company to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, designated personnel and
assets and to all existing books, records, documents and information relating
to the Acquired Companies, and promptly provide Parent and Parent's
Representatives with all reasonably requested information regarding the
business of the Acquired Companies and such additional financial, operating
and other data and information regarding the Acquired Companies, as Parent may
reasonably request, in each case for any reasonable purpose related to the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access shall be conducted at a reasonable time, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Acquired Companies and in such a manner as not
to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Acquired Companies. Any such access shall be subject to the Company's
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not
include invasive testing. Nothing herein shall require the Company to
disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its
reasonable discretion and after notice to Parent (i) jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege (so long as the Company has reasonably
cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract (so
long as the Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit
disclosure to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements or the
contractual counterparty); _provided, however_ , in the case of _clause
(ii)_, that the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information to the extent doing so could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel))
be managed through the use of customary "clean room" arrangements pursuant to
which non-employee Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such
information. With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this
Section 5.01, Parent shall comply with, and shall instruct Parent's
Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the Mutual
Confidential Disclosure Agreement, effective as of January 1, 2019 and as
amended thereafter, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
may satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical
access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under the
applicable Legal Requirements (including any COVID-19 Measures).

  



  

(b)  (i) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of (A) any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Body in connection
with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions; or (B) any
Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Party's knowledge, threatened in
writing against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating
to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Offer, the
Merger or any other Transaction.

  



  

(ii)  (A) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change,
circumstance, condition, development, effect, event, occurrence or state of
facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, or would reasonably be expected to make the satisfaction of any of
the Offer Conditions impossible or unlikely, and (B) Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company of any change, circumstance, condition, development,
effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or would reasonably be
expected to make the satisfaction of any of the Offer Conditions impossible
or unlikely.

  



    

33

 



    

(iii)  For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this __Section 5.01(b) shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any
Offer Condition or any of the conditions set forth in __Article 7 or give
rise to any right to terminate under __Article 8.

  



  

Section 5.02.   _Operation of the Company 's Business. _During the Pre-
Closing Period, except (w) as expressly required by this Agreement or as

Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of

any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than discussions solely to clarify the
terms and conditions of such proposal or offer), (B) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,

or documents previously furnished to any Person (other than Parent, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives) that has made or has
indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal and all material
incorporating such information created by any such Person.

  



  

(b)  If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons,
which Acquisition Proposal was made

  



    

37

 



    

on or after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material
breach of this Section 5.03, and the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Offer and that the failure to take such
action described in  _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements,
then, notwithstanding anything in Section 5.03(a) to the contrary, the
Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with
respect to the Acquired Companies to the Person or group of Persons who has

Parent of such determination in good faith of the Board of Directors as
provided for above.

summary of any material unwritten terms and conditions thereof (and indicate
the identity of such Person), and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 36 hours of any request
by Parent for an update as to the status of any such material development,
discussion or negotiation).

  



  

(d)  Nothing in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company any
"stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from taking and disclosing such other position or
disclosure as is required under Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from taking any action
necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ ,
that, the Board of Directors shall not effect a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.01(b).

  



  

  

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representative of any Acquired Company acting on behalf of the Company takes
any action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this

Section 5.03.

38

 



    

  

each time a Determination Notice is given Parent shall, subject to the

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and subject to compliance
with the other provisions of this Section 6.01:

  



  

(i)  if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, the Board of Directors shall
have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Offer, (x) the Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, or (y) provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries are not
in breach of __Section 5.03 in any material respect and in a manner that led
to such Acquisition Proposal and subject to the other provisions of
__Section 8.01(e), the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
__Section 8.01(e) to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such
Superior Offer, in each case, if and only if: (A) the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company 's outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under
applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior
written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to __Section 8.01(e) at
least three business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change

shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination)
and, if requested in writing by Parent during such three business day period,

faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another
proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that such Acquisition Proposal

have provided to Parent information with respect to such Acquisition

  



    

39

 



    

Proposal in accordance with __Section 5.03(c), as well as a copy of any
acquisition agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of
any financing commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to
the Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof), (2) the
Company shall have given Parent the three business day period after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Offer, and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made
by Parent during such period, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, the Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to __Section
8.01(e) would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look
and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, taking and disclosing a position
or otherwise making any disclosure as is required under Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
otherwise complying with applicable Legal Requirements shall not, in and of
itself, be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not
require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures
set forth in this __Section 6.01. The provisions of this __Section 6.01(b)(i)
shall also apply to any change to any of the financial terms (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or other material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice
( _provided_ that for the purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice,
all references to "three business days" shall be deemed to be "two business
days"); and

  



  

(ii)  other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject
to __Section 6.01(b)(i)), the Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if: (A) the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company 's
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent
a Determination Notice at least three business days prior to making any such
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, if desired by Parent, during such
three business day period shall have negotiated, and caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with respect to any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent proposed by
Parent so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no longer be
necessary; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances that render a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation necessary, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the three
business day period after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (3) after giving
effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, the Board
of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make
the Company Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal
Requirements. The provisions of this __Section 6.01(b)(ii) shall also apply
to any material change to the facts and circumstances specified by the
Company pursuant to _clause __(C) __(1)_ above and require a new
Determination Notice

( _provided _ that for the purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice,
all references to "three business days" shall be deemed to be "two business
days").

  



  

Section 6.02.   _Filings, Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a)  The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take promptly
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental Body, so as
to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, but in no case
later than the End Date, including providing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable all non-legally privileged information required by
any Governmental Body pursuant to its evaluation of the Transactions under
the HSR Act. Subject to the terms of this Section 6.02, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain from any Governmental Body all
consents, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained under
the Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry or enactment of any injunction or
other order or decree relating to any Antitrust Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, proffer and agree to (i) sell,
license, divest or dispose of or hold separate (through the establishment of
a trust or otherwise) or agree to any other structural, behavioral or conduct
remedy, before or after the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any
entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product
lines, assets, Intellectual Property Rights or businesses of Parent, the
Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), and
(ii) agree to any other restriction on the conduct of such businesses, in each
case as may be necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect to the Transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing
to occur as promptly as practicable, but in no case later than the End Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent
or any of its Affiliates to agree to any such remedy or restriction if such
actions would (x) materially and adversely affect the business of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole following consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby, (y) require the sale, license, divestiture, disposal, or
holding separate of, IMMU-132 (Trodelvy) or (z) require any other structural,
behavioral or conduct remedy involving any Product Candidate if, in the case
of this clause (z), any such remedy would have a material impact on the value
or business prospects of the Product Candidates taken as a whole to Parent
and its Subsidiaries following the consummation of the Transactions. Nothing
in this Section 6.02 shall permit the Company to take any of the actions
listed in (i) or (ii) above without Parent's prior written consent or require
Parent or the Acquired Companies to take or agree to take any of the actions
listed in (i) or (ii) above unless the effectiveness of such action is
conditioned upon Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, if any lawsuit or
other proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is brought or
threatened to be brought challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit
the consummation of the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, each of
Parent, Purchaser, and the Company shall contest and resist any such action
or proceeding to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that results from such action or proceeding and that prohibits,
prevents or restrains consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby on
or before the End Date.

  



    

  

(b)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable,
to): (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than 10 business
days after the date of this Agreement), make an appropriate filing of all
Notification and Report forms as required by the HSR Act, with respect to the
Transactions and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether (and
promptly preparing and making if so required) any other filings,
notifications or other consents are required to be made with, or obtained
from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.02, during the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Parties shall (i) cooperate
in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or
submission in connection with any investigation or other

  



    

41

 



    

inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity
to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii)
give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a
Governmental Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in
each case, with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, (iii)
keep the other Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv)
promptly inform the other Parties of, and wherever practicable give the other
party reasonable advance notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, any
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, (v) promptly furnish to the other Party, subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants, with copies of documents provided to or received from
any Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (except that documents, including
"4(c) and 4(d) documents" as that term is defined under the HSR Act, that
contain valuation information can be redacted), (vi) subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants, consult and cooperate with the other Parties and consider in good
faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any written analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding, and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, give the other Party reasonable prior notice and
permit authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at each
meeting or conference, including by telephone or videoconference, relating to
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each
Party shall supply as promptly as practicable such information,
documentation, other material or testimony that may be requested by any
Governmental Body, including by complying at the earliest
reasonably practicable date with any request for additional information,
documents or other materials received by any Party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body in connection with the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Party shall commit to or agree with
any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, or delay the consummation of the Transactions, or withdraw
any notification filed under the HSR Act, without the prior written consent
of the other Party.

  



  

(d)  During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall to the extent
permissible under applicable Legal Requirements and reasonably practicable
and where doing so would not reasonably be expected to impair or adversely
affect the Company, any of its plans with respect to the Product Candidates
or its ability to interact with any Governmental Body consistent with
companies at similar stages of development in the pharmaceutical industry (in
each case as determined in good faith by the Company) (i) offer Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Acquired Companies prior to any proposed
material meeting or other material communication with the FDA, EMA, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (" _CMS_ ") or any other Specified
Governmental Body relating to any Product Candidate or material Governmental
Authorization (it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to delay or modify any of its actions as a result of this Section
6.02(d)), (ii) promptly inform Parent of, and provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review, in advance, any material filing proposed to
be made by or on behalf of any Acquired Company, and any material
correspondence or other material communication proposed to be submitted or
otherwise transmitted to the FDA, EMA, CMS or any other Specified
Governmental Body by or on behalf of any Acquired Company, in

  



    

42

 



    

each case relating to any Product Candidate or material Governmental
Authorization (it being understood that in no event shall the Acquired
Companies be required to delay any such filings, correspondence or
communication), (iii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMA, CMS or
any other Specified Governmental Body or relating to any Product Candidate or
Governmental Authorization and (iv) promptly inform Parent and provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity (but no more than two business days, to the
extent practicable) to comment, in each case, prior to making any material
change to any study protocol, adding any new trial, making any material
change to a manufacturing plan or process, making any material change to a
development timeline or initiating, or making any material change to,
commercialization and reimbursement activities or materials (including
promotional and marketing activities and materials) relating to any Product
Candidate. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any significant data
relating to any Product Candidate, including information related to any
significant adverse events with respect to any Product Candidate, in each
case which it discovers after the date hereof.

  



  

(e)  Neither Party shall enter into any agreement, transaction, or any
agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition)
that would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to
materially increase the time required, to (i) obtain the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) avoid the entry of,
the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Bodies
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 6.03.   _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one
year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to each individual who is employed by an Acquired Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be actively
employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such
period (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), (i) base salary or base wages and
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities, on a basis, in
each case, that is no less favorable than that in effect immediately prior to
the execution of this Agreement, (ii) equity compensation awards that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the equity compensation awards
generally provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and (iii) all other employee benefits (excluding severance) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided in the aggregate
(excluding severance) to such Continuing Employee by the Acquired
Companies immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement.

  



    

  

(b)  Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation's health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the health and welfare benefit plans of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that (i)
nothing in this Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate, in
accordance with its terms, any such health or welfare benefit plan at any
time, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 6.03(a), and (ii) if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare
benefit plan (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), then the
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving
Corporation's (or an Affiliate's) health and welfare benefit plans to the
extent that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under
an Employee

  



    

43

 



    

Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant under any benefit plan
of Parent or an Affiliate and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall
ensure that such benefit plan shall, for all purposes (except pension
accruals or as would result in any duplication of benefits), credit Continuing
Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Acquired Companies
and their Affiliates or their respective predecessors; _provided_ , that, if
such benefit plan replaces a benefit plan of an Acquired Company that
recognized service for the same purpose, such service will be recognized to
the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time
under the corresponding benefit plan of an Acquired Company. Nothing in this
Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
right in any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

  



  

(c)  To the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, with
respect to any employee benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the
Continuing Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, any of its Affiliates, and any successor
thereto, to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-
existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same
extent waived or satisfied under comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such
employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under
similar plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d)  As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event not later than ten
days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall make available
to Parent a detailed set of calculations (together with all relevant backup
data) reflecting the potential impact of Section 280G of the Code with
respect to each Person who could be entitled to any payment or benefit in
connection with the Transactions (either alone or in combination with other
events or circumstances) which could potentially constitute a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

  

(e) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the date in 2021 that annual
bonus payments in respect of calendar year 2020 are paid to employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice pursuant to the Company Bonus Plan (the " _Ordinary 2020
Bonus Payment Date_ "), then Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay to each Continuing Employee who participates in the
Company Bonus Plan and (i) remains actively employed through the
Ordinary 2020 Bonus Payment Date or (ii) experiences a severance qualifying
termination of employment on or after the date that the Effective Time occurs
and prior to the Ordinary 2020 Bonus Payment Date, an annual bonus in respect
of calendar year 2020 pursuant to the Company Bonus Plan on the Ordinary 2020
Bonus Payment Date (but in no event later than March 15, 2021); _provided_
that all "Company Performance Metrics" (as defined in the Company Bonus Plan)
in respect of calendar year 2020 shall be deemed achieved at 150% of the
target level.

  

  



  

(f)  The provisions of this Section 6.03 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no provision of this Section 6.03 is intended to, or shall,
constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee
benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no

  



    

44

 



    

current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

  



  

Section 6.04.   _ESPP_ . The Company shall take all necessary actions to (a)
suspend the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement, such that no "
_Offering_ " (as defined in the Company ESPP) is in effect as of or following
the date of this Agreement, (b) ensure that no further Offering shall
commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, and
(c) terminate the Company ESPP effective as of immediately prior to, and
conditional upon the occurrence of, the Offer Acceptance Time.

  



    

  

Section 6.05.   _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Acquired Companies under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
other organizational documents) of each of the Acquired Companies, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Person (as defined below), and Parent shall
cause the Acquired Companies to perform their obligations thereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation
agrees that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of
the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of any Acquired Company or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving
at the request of any Acquired Company as a director or officer of another
Person (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising out
of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person

  



    

45

 



    

is or was a director or officer of any Acquired Company or is or was serving
at the request of any Acquired Company as a director or officer of another
Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified
Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with
the organizational documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the
Surviving Corporation's or any of its Subsidiaries' certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any
such indemnification or other similar agreements, as applicable, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  



  

(b)  For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
or for the benefit of the Acquired Companies or provide substitute policies
for the Acquired Companies and their current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired
Companies, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the
benefit of the Acquired Companies with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers
having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies an annual premium greater than 300% of the aggregate annual premium
most recently paid by the Acquired Companies prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.05(b) it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six
year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may purchase a "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for the Acquired
Companies and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Companies,
such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing
coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons
than the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Acquired Companies with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that
in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  



  

(c)  In the event that any Acquired Company or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, such
Acquired Company, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of such Acquired Company assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

  



    

46

 



    

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (a) (i) shall survive the
acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation
of the Merger and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section 6.05 may not
be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of
their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the
affected Indemnified Person.

  



  

Section 6.06.   _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions is
brought by any stockholder or other holder of Acquired Company securities
(whether directly or on behalf of the Acquired Companies or otherwise)
against any Acquired Company and/or its directors or officers, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly
informed of any material developments with respect to such litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the (a) opportunity to participate in the defense of
any such litigation, (b) right to review and comment on all material filings
or responses to be made by any Acquired Company in connection with such
litigation (and shall give due consideration to Parent's comments and other
advice with respect to such litigation) and (c) right to consult on any
settlement with respect to such litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), _provided, however_ , that the
Company shall otherwise control the defense and/or settlement and the
disclosure of information in connection therewith shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 5.01, including regarding attorney-client privilege or
other applicable legal privilege.

  



  

Section 6.07.   _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, including Section 6.02(a), Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party
pursuant to any Material Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and the other Transactions to the extent requested in writing by Parent, (b)
seek each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any Material
Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions to the extent
requested in writing by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any such consent or approval shall
not, in and of itself, be a condition to the Offer or the Merger and (c) seek
to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the
Merger brought by any third Person against such Party. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 6.07 to the contrary, neither Parent, the Company
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consent
or other similar fee, payment or consideration, make any other concession or
provide any additional security (including a guaranty), to obtain any third
party consents.

  



  

Section 6.08.   _Disclosure_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent,
and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement
or making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer,
the

  



    

47

 



    

Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue
any such press release, public statement or announcement to
Company Associates without the other Party's written consent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make
any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal
announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so
long as such statements substantially reiterate (and are not inconsistent
with) previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other
Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party but
subject to giving advance notice to the other Party and consulting with the
other Party with respect to the content thereof, issue any such press release
or make any such public announcement or statement that, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, is determined to be required by Legal
Requirement; (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in connection
with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing to be
issued or made pursuant to Section 5.03(d); and (d) neither Party need
consult with the other in connection with such portion of any press release,
public statement or filing to be issued with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation (but without limiting the
Company's obligations under Section 5.03 or Section 6.01).

  



  

Section 6.09.   _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of
the Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.10.   _Section 16 Matters_. The Company, and the Board of
Directors (or a duly formed committee thereof consisting of non-
employee directors (as such term is defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act)), shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve,
for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and
cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares, Company Options
and Company RSUs in the Merger by applicable individuals and to cause such
dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.11.   _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time
and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and
held, will approve, as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between
Purchaser, any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates and any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Acquired Companies that are effective
as of the date of this Agreement or are entered into after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to which
compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and will take all
other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.
Promptly upon Parent or any of its Affiliates entering into any such
arrangement with any of the officers, directors or employees of the Acquired
Companies, Parent will provide to the Company any and all information
concerning such arrangements as may be needed by the Company to comply with
this Section 6.11.

  



  

Section 6.12.   _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be

  



    

48

 



    

taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules
and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.13.   _401(k) Plan_. To the extent requested in writing by Parent
at least 10 days prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take
all actions that may be necessary under the Company's 401(k) plan to terminate
the Company's 401(k) plan at least one day prior to the Effective Time. If
the Company terminates the Company's 401(k) plan in accordance with the
preceding sentence, (1) prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as
applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the Company's 401(k) plan and/or the tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by Parent (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in the form of cash, or
notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof, in an amount equal to
the full account balance distributed or distributable to such Continuing
Employee from the Company 401(k) plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan and (2) each
Continuing Employee shall become a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan on
the Closing Date (giving effect to the service crediting provisions of
Section 6.03(b)); it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation
in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred such that a condition
set forth in _clause (b) _or _(c)_ of Annex I would not be satisfied and
cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured
in such time period, shall not have been cured within forty-five (45) days of
the date Parent gives the Company written notice of such breach or failure to

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(f) if either Parent
or Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation hereunder; or

  



    

50

 



    

(g)  by the Company, if (i) a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation

Section 8.02.   _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.01, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant

force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates
following any such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the final
sentence of Section 1.02(b), the final sentence of Section 5.01(a), this
Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article 9 (other than Section 9.05(b)) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force
and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and (c) except as set forth in Section 8.03, the termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or
willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to termination.

  



  

Section 8.03.   _Expenses; Termination Fees_.

  



  

(a)  Except as set forth in this Section 8.03, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated.

  



  

(b)  In the event that:

  



  

(i)  this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to __Section
8.01(e), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or simultaneously with (and as a
condition to the effectiveness of) such termination;

  



  

(ii)  this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to __Section 8.01(d),
the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds within one business day after such termination; or

  



  

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(b) (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at
such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii)) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
resulting from a willful and material breach of Section 5.03 or Section 6.01,
(y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal, or such Acquisition Proposal has otherwise been communicated to the
Board of Directors or the Company's stockholders and shall have become
publicly known, after the date hereof and prior to such termination, and such
Acquisition Proposal has not been unconditionally withdrawn prior to such
termination and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Board
of Directors shall have approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal
(regardless of when made) and the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, which shall have been
consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause (z)_ the
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%"), the Company shall pay to Parent or its
designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds prior to the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.

  



    

  



    

51

 



    

  



  

(c)  It is understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, " _Termination
Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $732,052,638. In any circumstance in
which the Termination Fee becomes due and payable and is paid by the Company
in accordance with this Section 8.03, the Termination Fee shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages for, and the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
available to Parent and Purchaser in connection with, any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action
or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and
Purchaser may seek specific performance to cause the Company to consummate
the Transactions in accordance with Section 9.05 or the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.03(c), but in no event shall
Parent or Purchaser be entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause the
Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance with Section 9.05 and
(ii) the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.03(c).

  



  

(d)  Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee and any other payments pursuant to Section 8.03 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and any of
their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  



  

(e)  The Parties acknowledge (i) that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the

  



   

52

 



    

circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions and (iii) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 8.03(b), and, in order to obtain the payment,
Parent commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the
Company, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually received.

  



  

Article 9 
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 9.01.   _Amendment_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this
Agreement may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of
Directors of the Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time; _provided_ that,
following the consummation of the Offer, this Agreement may not be amended in
any manner that causes the Merger Consideration to differ from the Offer
Price. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  



  

Section 9.02.   _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise
any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on
the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,
privilege or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right,
privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to
have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim,
power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party and any such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. At any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other with
any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by any Legal Requirement except
to the extent set forth in Section 8.03.

  



  

Section 9.03.   _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

  



    

53

 



    

Section 9.04.   _Entire Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement (including
its Exhibits, Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between
any of the Parties and their respective Affiliates, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement except that the
restrictions on disclosure (to the extent to be included in SEC filings in
connection with the Transactions) in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
solely for purposes of permitting the actions contemplated hereby to be
consummated. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties.

  



  

Section 9.05.   _Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if
(but only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States
District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any
appellate court therefrom (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii)
each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 9.09. Each of
the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

  



  

(b)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 9.05(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and
(ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. The right to specific enforcement hereunder
shall include the right of the Company, on behalf of itself and any third
party

  



    

54

 



    

beneficiaries to this Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties
have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.05(b) shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

  



  

(c)  EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.05.

  



  

Section 9.06.   _Assignability_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned
by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided further_ ,  _however_ ,
that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-
owned direct or indirect Delaware corporate Subsidiary of Parent to act as
Purchaser, in which event all references to Purchaser in this Agreement shall
be deemed references to such other Subsidiary; _provided_ such assignment
shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

Section 9.07.   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other
than the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement; except for: (a) if the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs, (i) the right of the Company's stockholders to receive the Offer
Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Article 1 or
Article 2 following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the right
of the holders of Company Options or Company RSUs to receive the applicable
treatment pursuant to Section 2.08 following the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement; (b) the provisions set forth in Section 6.05
of this Agreement with respect to the Persons referred to therein; and (c)
the right of the Company to pursue damages, on behalf of its
stockholders, against Parent and/or Purchaser for the loss of the Merger
Consideration in the event of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Purchaser.

  



  

Section 9.08.   _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
2.06(b), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes and fees imposed on the Company with respect to the transfer of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger shall be borne by the Company and
expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares, expressly
excluding any such Taxes imposed on the holders of Shares. The Company shall
cooperate with

  



    

55

 



    

Purchaser and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with
respect to such Taxes.

  



  

Section 9.09.   _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) two business days after being sent by
registered mail or by courier or express delivery service, or (c) upon
confirmation of successful transmission if sent by email followed up within
one business day by dispatch pursuant to one of the other methods described
herein;  _provided_ that in each case the notice or other communication is

Section 9.10.   _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment

  



    

56

 



    

of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of
this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it
in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

  



  

Section 9.11.   _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall ensure that Purchaser
duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely basis each of the
covenants, obligations and liabilities applicable to Purchaser under this
Agreement, and Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with Purchaser
for the due and timely performance and satisfaction of each of said covenants,
obligations and liabilities.

(a)  For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders.

  



  

(b)  The Parties agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

(d)  Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits" or "Annexes" are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement and Exhibits or Annexes to this Agreement.

  



  

(e)  The bold-faced headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and
shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation
of this Agreement.

The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment, and pay for, Shares

to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _clauses (a) _through

payment for, any tendered Shares, and, to the extent permitted by the

and (ii) at any scheduled Expiration Date (subject to any extensions of the

by Parent and its Affiliates, represent one more Share than 50% of the total
number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer (the
" _Minimum Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, the Parties
shall exclude Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in
Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL);

Annex - 1

 



    

and correct (disregarding for this purpose all "Material Adverse Effect" and
"materiality" qualifications contained in such representations and
warranties) as of the date of the Agreement and at and as of the Offer
Acceptance Time as if made on and as of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to
the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to an
earlier date or period, in which case as of such date or period), except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect;

  



  

(c)  the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material
respects the obligations, covenants and agreements it is required to comply
with or perform at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time;

(e)  the waiting period applicable to the Offer under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated, and, if Parent and the Company have entered into
an agreement with any Governmental Body regarding the timing of the
consummation of the Offer, that agreement shall permit such consummation;

  



    

  

(f)  Parent and Purchaser shall have received a certificate executed on
behalf of the Company by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer confirming that the conditions set forth in _clauses (b)_,
_(c)_ and  _(d)_ of this _Annex I_ have been satisfied;

  



  

(g)  there shall not have been issued by any Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material
business operations, and remain in effect, any judgment, temporary restraining
order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling
restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the acquisition of or payment
for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or subsequent integration, nor shall any Legal Requirement have been
promulgated, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger
by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company
has material business operations which prohibits or makes illegal the
acquisition of or payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger or subsequent integration; and

  



    

(h)  the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

  



  

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of,
the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (including
any action or inaction by Parent or Purchaser) and (except for the Minimum
Condition) may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent and
Purchaser. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.
