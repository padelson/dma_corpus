Closing  Date, including all liabilities, responsibilities and obligations
relating  to or  arising from the following:

**Section  2.4** **Condition  on Assignment or Assumption of Contracts and
Rights** **.** ****

 

 

Anything  in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
shall not  constitute an agreement to assign or assume any Contract or any
claim or  right  or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if
an attempted  assignment or assumption thereof, without the Consent of a
third party thereto,  would constitute a breach thereof. Any transfer or
assignment to Buyer by  Seller  or any of its Affiliates of any property or
property rights or any 


 

 

 

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

Contract  that requires the Consent of any third party shall be made subject
to such  Consent being obtained. If such Consent is not obtained, or if an
attempted  assignment thereof would be ineffective or would affect the rights
of Seller  or  its Affiliate thereunder such that Buyer would not in fact
receive all such  rights, Seller will cooperate with Buyer in any arrangement
that does not  constitute a breach of such Contract, including an operating
or other services  agreement if reasonably required by Buyer, reasonably
designed to provide  for  Buyer the benefits under any such Contract or
rights including enforcement  for  the benefit of Buyer of any and all
rights of Seller or its Affiliates against  a  third party or Governmental
Body thereto arising out of the breach or  cancellation by such third party
or Governmental Body or otherwise. To the  extent that Buyer does receive all
of the benefits of any such Contract or  rights pursuant to the preceding
sentence, Buyer shall accept, and shall  indemnify Seller from and against,
the burdens (including the out-of-pocket  costs and expenses incurred by
Seller in performing such arrangement) and  perform the obligations under
such Contract as subcontractor of Seller to  the  extent of the benefit
received, and to the extent such burdens and obligations  would have
constituted an Assumed Liability if such Contract had been  transferred to
Buyer at the Closing. Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates  to
exercise or exploit their respective rights and options under all such 
Contracts referred to in this Section 2.4 only as reasonably directed by 
Buyer.  Furthermore, if the other party(ies) to such a Contract subsequently
Consent  to  the assignment of such Contract to Buyer, Buyer shall thereupon
agree to  assume  and perform all liabilities and the obligations arising
thereunder after  the  date of such Consent, at which time such Contract
shall be deemed an Asset,  without the payment of further consideration, and
the obligations so assumed  thereunder shall be deemed Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

 

**Section  2.5** **Settlement  of Intercompany Accounts.** ****

 

 

At  or  prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause all intercompany payables,
receivables  and loans between New England Gas Company or any of the
Subsidiaries relating  to  the Business, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates (other than  New  England Gas Company and the Subsidiaries), on
the other hand, to be settled  or  cancelled.

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  III**

purchase price  (the "Purchase Price") for the Assets owned directly by
Seller and for the Stock  shall be an amount in cash equal to FIVE HUNDRED
SEVENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS  ($575,000,000) less the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of, and accrued  and unpaid interest on, the Assumed
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the  "Estimated Purchase Price"), and as
adjusted in accordance with Section 3.2  (as so adjusted, the "Final Purchase
Price"), plus the assumption by Buyer at  Closing of the Assumed Liabilities
(including the Assumed  Indebtedness).

 

 

**Section  3.2** **Adjustment  to Estimated Purchase Price.**

(a) Within  90  days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller  a  statement (the "Closing Statement"), utilizing the
same accounting methods,  policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as
were used in the preparation  of the Base Statement as described on
_Schedule  1.1(a)_   (and  otherwise in accordance with GAAP, with such
exceptions to GAAP as indicated  on  _Schedule 1.1(a)_)  and  shall set
forth in reasonable detail the amount of Working Capital of the  Business as
of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (as well as the adjustments  contemplated
in Section 6.8), and a calculation of the adjustment to the  Estimated
Purchase Price that is payable based upon the difference between  the 
Working Capital Target and the Working Capital in the Closing Statement. 
Seller  agrees, at no cost to Buyer, to give Buyer and its authorized
representatives  reasonable access to such employees, officers and other
facilities and such  books and records of Seller and its Affiliates as are
reasonably necessary  to  allow Buyer and its authorized representatives to
prepare the Closing Statement.  The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with _Schedule  1.1(a)_.  The  Base Statement was prepared using
the same accounting methods, policies,  practices, procedures and adjustments
as were used in the preparation of  the  Financial Statements and otherwise
in accordance with GAAP (and with such  exceptions to GAAP as indicated on
_Schedule  1.1(a)_ ).

 

 

(b) Following  its receipt from Buyer of the Closing Statement, Seller shall
have 15 Business  Days to review the Closing Statement and to inform Buyer in
writing of any  disagreement (the "Objection") that it may have with the
Closing Statement,  which objection shall specify in reasonable detail
Seller\'s disagreement  with  the Closing Statement. If Buyer does not
receive the Objection within such  15-Business Day period, the amount of
Working Capital set forth on the Closing  Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) shall be deemed to have been  accepted by Seller and shall
become binding upon Seller. If Seller does timely  deliver an Objection to
Buyer, Buyer shall then have 15 Business Days from  the  date of receipt of
such Objection (the "Review Period") to review and respond to  the Objection.
Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any  disagreements
with respect to the determination of the Working Capital of  the  Business
as of the Closing Date or the amount of the adjustment to the Estimated 
Purchase Price. If they are unable to resolve all of their disagreements 
with  respect to the determination of Working Capital of the Business as of
the  Closing Date or the amount of the adjustment to the Estimated Purchase
Price  within 15 Business Days following the expiration of Buyer\'s Review
Period,  they  may refer, at the option of either Buyer or Seller, their
differences to  Ernst and Young, or if Ernst and Young declines to accept such
engagement, another  internationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants selected  jointly by Buyer and Seller, which accountants shall
determine, only with  respect to the disagreements so submitted, whether and
to what extent, if  any,  the amount of Working Capital of the Business as
of the Closing Date set  forth  in the Closing Statement requires
adjustment. If Buyer and Seller are unable  to  so select the independent
public accountants within 15 Business Days of Ernst  and Young declining to
accept such engagement, either Buyer or Seller may  thereafter request that
the American Arbitration Association make such selection  (as applicable,
Ernst and Young, the firm selected by Buyer and Seller or the  firm selected by
the American Arbitration Association is herein referred  to as  the "CPA
Firm"). Buyer and Seller shall direct the CPA Firm to use its  reasonable
best efforts to render its determination within 30 days after  the  issue is
first submitted to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm's determination shall be 
conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The fees and disbursements  of
the  CPA Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and

Seller.  Buyer and Seller shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all
relevant  books  and records relating to the Closing Statement and all other
items reasonably  requested by the CPA Firm. The Closing Statement as agreed
to by Buyer and  Seller or as determined by the CPA Firm shall be referred to
as the "Final  Closing Statement."

 

 

(c) In  the  event of a positive difference between Working Capital on the
Final Closing  Statement from the Working Capital Target, Buyer shall pay to
Seller in cash  the  amount of such difference, plus the Settlement Interest
thereon. In the event  of  a negative difference between the Working Capital
Target from the Working  Capital on the Final Closing Statement, Seller shall
pay to Buyer in cash  the  amount of such difference, plus the Settlement
Interest thereon. All amounts  payable under this Section 3.2(c) shall be
paid within five Business Days  of the  determination of the Final Closing
Statement by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to a bank account
in the United States of America designated  in  writing by the recipient not
less than one Business Day before such  payment.

Seller  or  the appropriate Subsidiary has filed all United States federal,
state, local  and  foreign Tax Returns required to be filed by Seller or
such Subsidiary with  respect to the Assets, Subsidiaries, or assets of any
Subsidiary or requests  for  extensions to file such Tax Returns have been
timely filed, and Seller or  such  Subsidiary has timely paid and discharged
or made adequate provision for  all  Taxes (other than Retained Liabilities)
except where the failure to so file,  pay, discharge or make adequate
provision for are not, individually or in  the  aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a material impact on the Business. All  such  Tax Returns are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. There  are  no pending
audits, other examinations, or Threatened Proceedings relating  to any  Tax
matters of the Subsidiaries or relating to the Business except as set 
forth  in _Schedule 5.9_.  There  are no Tax liens on the Assets or the
assets of any Subsidiary. As of the  date  of this Agreement, neither Seller
(with respect to the Business) nor any  Subsidiary has granted any waiver of
any statute of limitations, or any  extension of a period for the assessment

have any obligation under any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity or
similar  agreement, understanding or arrangement pursuant to which any of
the  Subsidiaries or Seller has assumed an obligation to satisfy any Tax
obligations  of another person or entity. Up to and including the Closing
Date, none of  the  Subsidiaries has carried on its business and other
activities in such a way  that  would result in the recognition by any
Subsidiary of liabilities for Taxes  after  the Closing Date as result of
such activities (for example, none of the  Subsidiaries has engaged in a IRC
Section 355 transaction nor has engaged  in any  activity or accounting
practice that is a "reportable transaction" as defined in  Treas. Reg.
Section 1.6011-4). Except for liability for Taxes arising as  part of  an
affiliated, consolidated or combined group with Southern Union Company  and 
its Affiliates under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar

any  liability for the Taxes of any person as a transferee, or successor or
otherwise  (including any liability under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any  similar provision of state, local or foreign law). The
Subsidiaries have  withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in  connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor,  creditor, member or other third party. None of the
Assets or assets of the  Subsidiaries are (a) required, pursuant to section
168(g) of the IRC, to  be  depreciated under the "alternative depreciation
system" within the meaning of  section 168(g)(2) of the IRC, (b) subject to
the provisions of section 168(f)  of  the IRC, or (c) subject to a tax
benefit transfer lease subject to the  provisions of former section 168(f)(8)
of the IRC. The only representations  and  warranties given in respect of
tax matters are those contained in this Section  5.9 and none of the other
representations and warranties set forth in this  Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute, directly or indirectly, a  representation or warranty in
respect of tax matters.

that,  individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have  a  Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule  5.10_

by Seller  or  any Subsidiary of any patent, trademark, service mark or
copyright of others  or  (b) any infringement of any patent, trademark,
service mark or copyright  owned  by or under license to Seller or any
Subsidiary except for any such  infringements of the type described in clause
(a) or (b) that are not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

**Section  5.11** **Personal  Property.** ****

 

 

Except  for such exceptions as are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, the machinery,
equipment and vehicles  included among the Assets are in normal operating
condition and in a state  of  reasonable maintenance and repair and are
suitable in all material respects  for  the purposes for which they are now
being used in the conduct of the  Business.

 

 

**Section  5.12** **Material  Contracts.** ****

 

 

_Schedule  5.12_   contains  a complete list of all Material Contracts.
Seller has made available to Buyer  a  true and correct copy of each
Material Contract, including all amendments  and  modifications thereof.
Except as described in _Schedule 5.12_,  all of  the Material Contracts are
in full force and effect (subject to the expiration  of the stated term of
any such Material Contract in accordance with its terms)  and there are no
defaults under any such Contracts by Seller or any of its  Affiliates
(including the Subsidiaries) or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, the counter  parties
to such Contracts, except for any failure to be in full force and  effect 
and for any default that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be 
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

**Section  5.13** **Employee  Benefit Matters.** ****

 

 

(a) _  Schedule 5.13(a)_   contains  a true and complete list of each
deferred compensation and each incentive  compensation, stock purchase, stock
option and other equity compensation  plan,  program, agreement or
arrangement; each severance or termination pay, medical,  surgical,
hospitalization, life insurance and other "welfare" plan, fund or  program
(within the meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA); each profit-sharing,  stock
bonus or other "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of 
section 3(2) of ERISA); each employment, termination or severance agreement; 
and  each other employee benefit plan, fund, program, agreement or
arrangement,  in  each case, that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to
or required to  be  contributed to by the Seller or by any trade or
business, whether or not  incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together
with the Seller would be  deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of
section 4001(b) of ERISA, or to  which the Seller or an ERISA Affiliate is
party for the benefit of any Employee  or Former Employee of the Seller (the
"Employee Plans"). Seller's Pension  Plans and Seller's 401(k) Plan are the
only Employee Plans that are intended to  be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the IRC. Each employee benefit plan  (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA) that is sponsored, maintained  or  contributed to or required to
be contributed to by Seller or an ERISA Affiliate  of Seller and that is
subject to

Section  302 or Title IV of ERISA or section 412 of the IRC is hereinafter
referred  to as  a "Title IV Plan."

 

 

(b) With  respect to each Employee Plan, Seller has heretofore delivered to
Buyer true  and  complete copies of the Employee Plan and any amendments
thereto (or if the  Employee Plan is not a written Employee Plan, a
description thereof), any  related trust or other funding vehicle, any
reports or summaries required  under  ERISA or the IRC and the most recent
determination letter received from the  Internal Revenue Service with respect
to each Employee Plan intended to qualify  under section 401 of the IRC.

 

 

(c) No  liability under Title IV or section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
the  Seller  or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and
no condition  exists that presents a material risk to the Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate  of  incurring any such liability, other than liability for
premiums due the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") (which
premiums have been paid when  due). Insofar as the representation made in
this Section 5.13(c) applies  to sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of
ERISA, it is made with respect  to  any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement subject to Title  IV  of ERISA to which the Seller
or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required  to  make, contributions during
the five (5)-year period ending on the last day  of  the most recent plan
year ended prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(d) The  PBGC  has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan
and no condition  exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings
will be  instituted.

 

 

(e) No  Title  IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated  funding deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and
section 412 of the  IRC), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal  year  of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Closing
Date. All contributions  required to be made with respect to any Employee
Plan on or prior to the  Closing  Date have been timely made.

 

 

(f) No  Title  IV Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in
section 3(37) of ERISA,  nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described in section
4063(a) of ERISA.  Neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has made or
suffered a "complete  withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms
are respectively defined in  sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA (or any
liability resulting therefrom has  been  satisfied in full).

 

 

(g) Neither  the Seller or any Subsidiary, any Employee Plan, any trust
created thereunder,  nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in
a transaction in  connection with which the Seller or any Subsidiary, any
Employee Plan, any  such  trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or
any party dealing with  any  Employee Plan or any such trust could be
subject to either a civil penalty  assessed pursuant to section 409 or 502(i)
of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant  to  section 4975 or 4976 of the IRC.

 

 

(h) Each  Employee Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects  in  accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but
not limited to  ERISA  and the IRC.

(i) Each  Employee Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
section 401(a) of  the IRC is so qualified and the trusts maintained
thereunder are exempt from  taxation under section 501(a) of the IRC. Each
Employee Plan intended to  satisfy  the requirements of Section 501(c)(9)
has satisfied such  requirements.

 

 

(j) Except  as  disclosed in _Schedule  5.13(j)_ ,  no  Employee Plan
provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar  benefits
(whether or not insured) for Employees or Former Employees of the  Seller or
any Subsidiary for periods extending beyond their retirement or  other 
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, 
(ii)  death benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full
cost of  which is borne by the Employee or Former Employee (or his 
beneficiary).

 

 

(k) No  amounts payable under the Employee Plans will fail to be deductible
for federal  income tax purposes by virtue of section 280G of the IRC.

 

 

(l) Except  as  disclosed in _Schedule  5.13(l)_ ,  the  consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,  either  alone or
in combination with another event, (i) entitle any Employee, Former  Employee
or officer of the Seller or any Subsidiary to severance pay or any  other
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)  accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of  compensation due
any such Employee, Former Employee or officer.

 

 

(m) There  are  no pending, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf
of any Employee  Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such
Employee Plan,  or  otherwise involving any such Employee Plan (other than
routine claims for  benefits).

 

 

(n) The  Subsidiaries do not employ any Employees or any other individuals
and do  not  currently maintain any Employee Plan.

 

 

(o) The  only  representations and warranties given in respect of employee
benefit matters  are  those contained in this Section 5.13 and Section 5.14
and none of the other  representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed  to  constitute, directly or indirectly, a
representation or warranty in respect  of  employee benefit matters.

 

 

**Section  5.14** **Employee  and Labor Matters** **.**

presently pending or Threatened before the National Labor Relations Board  or

to any present  or former employees or consultants for any services or
amounts required to  be  reimbursed or otherwise paid.

 

 

(e) To  the  Knowledge of Seller, no employee is in any respect in violation
of any  employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law
nondisclosure  obligation, fiduciary duty, noncompetition agreement,
restrictive covenant  or  other obligation to a former employer relating to

Environmental Permits related to the Assets or the Business, in each case 
except  where the failure to obtain or apply or be in compliance with such

Representative  at  the time of the Closing or subsequently obtained by
Seller, any Affiliate  of  Seller or any such Representative from Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or  any  Related Document) (" _Restricted 
Information_ "),  and  shall not directly or indirectly use such Restricted

file with  the SEC  a proxy statement in preliminary form (together with any
amendments or  supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") in connection with

Proxy Statement to be mailed to  its  stockholders as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement,  and the parties shall
respond promptly to any comments with respect to any  other  statement or
schedule filed by them. No filing of, or amendment or supplement  to, the
Proxy Statement or any other statement or schedule will be made by  Seller
without providing Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and comment  on 
the portions thereof pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement. If at any time after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to 
Seller\'s stockholders and prior to the Seller Meeting any information
relating  to Seller, Buyer or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors,  should be discovered by Seller or Buyer which is required to be
set forth  in an  amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that
the Proxy Statement  will  not include any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any  material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which  discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and an  appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be  promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, rule or  regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of Seller.

 

 

 

(ii) _Buyer  Information_.  Buyer  agrees that it will provide Seller with
all information concerning Buyer  necessary or reasonably appropriate to be

applicable law, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, 
as  soon as practicable following the date upon which the Proxy Statement
is  cleared  by the SEC, and in no event later than 75 days after such date,
a special  meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of considering
and taking  action upon this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the  "Seller\'s Meeting"); _provided,  however_ ,  that in  lieu
of calling a special meeting, Seller shall be entitled to submit this 
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to a vote of its
stockholders  at Seller\'s 2006 annual meeting of its stockholders (provided

Seller, shall (a) recommend adoption  of  this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and include such  recommendation in the

assistance  in  connection therewith. Buyer will cause such records to be
maintained for  not  less than seven years from the Closing Date and will
not dispose of such  records  without first offering in writing to deliver
them to Seller; _provided,  however,_   that in  the event that Buyer
transfers all or a portion of the Business to any third  party during such
period, Buyer may transfer to such third party all or a  portion of the
books, records, files and documents related thereof, provided  such third
party transferee expressly assumes in writing the obligations  of  Buyer
under this Section 6.2(b). In addition, on and after the Closing Date,  at 
Seller's request, Buyer shall make available to Seller and its Affiliates, 
employees, representatives and agents, those employees of Buyer requested 
by  Seller in connection with any Proceeding, including to provide
testimony,  to be  deposed, to act as witnesses and to assist counsel;
_provided,  however,_   that  (i) such access to such employees shall not
unreasonably interfere with the  normal conduct of the operations of Buyer
and (ii) Seller shall reimburse  Buyer for the out-of-pocket costs reasonably
incurred by Buyer in making  such  employees available to Seller. Without
limiting the application of Section  6.1(d), all documents or information
furnished by Buyer or obtained by Seller  or  its Representatives hereunder
shall be subject to Section 6.1(d).

 

 

(c) _Seller  Guarantees and Surety Instruments_.  Buyer  shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining  full  and

harmless Seller and its  Affiliates for any and all Losses (in each case
without deduction or set  off)  incurred on account of Seller's guarantees,
letters of credit, bonds and other  surety instruments on or after the
Closing Date insofar as such Losses relate  to  any failure of Buyer or any

the HSR Act with respect to the  transactions contemplated hereby within ten
Business Days following the  execution of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
shall supply as promptly as  practicable any additional information or
documentary material that may be  requested pursuant to the HSR Act and shall

for information, including requests for production  of  documents and
production of witnesses for interviews or depositions, made  by the 
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the United

authorities  of any  other jurisdiction (the "Antitrust Authorities") and
take all other reasonable  actions to obtain clearance from the Antitrust
Authorities, or if such clearance  cannot be obtained, to reach an agreement,
settlement, consent providing  for  divestiture, a "hold separate"
agreement, contractual undertakings with third  parties or any other relief
with the concerned Antitrust Authority in order  to  permit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Buyer shall exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts, and Seller shall  cooperate fully with
Buyer, to prevent the entry in any Proceeding brought  by an  Antitrust
Authority or any Governmental Body of an Order that would prohibit,  make
unlawful or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by
this  Agreement. Seller shall not oppose any efforts of Buyer, including
Buyer's  proffer of consent to any Order, to complete lawfully the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, and shall cooperate in good
faith with Buyer  and  the Antitrust Authorities to the same effect. ****

Divestiture constitutes other than an immaterial  restriction on the
operations thereof, or (z) to any material business unit  of  such party or
any subsidiary or Affiliate of such party to the extent that  such

Consents  as may be necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby  in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer
and Seller will diligently  pursue such Consents and will cooperate with each
other in seeking such  Consents. To such end, the parties agree to make
available the personnel  and  other resources of their respective
organizations in order to obtain all  such  Consents. Each party will
promptly inform the other party of any communication  received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental  Body  from which any such
Consent is required and of any material communication  received or given in
connection with any Proceeding by a private party, in  each  case regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and will permit  the  other
party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with  each 
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental 
Body  or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party, with such
other  Person, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body or other
Person,  give the other party the opportunity to attend and to participate in
such  meetings and conferences. Neither party shall take any action in
connection  with  obtaining any Consent from any Governmental Body that is
intended to create,  allocate, or shift to the other party any liability
arising from the obtaining  of such Consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither party shall be required  to agree to any divestiture of or material
restriction on, a material business,  a material asset or a material group of
related assets that, in any such  case,  is owned or operated by it or any
of its Affiliates.

without limitation,  all Environmental Permits, prior to the Closing Date, to
the extent required  by  applicable Legal Requirements.

its Affiliates  (other  than the Subsidiaries), the "Seller Marks"); shall
use commercially reasonable  efforts to remove from the Assets any and all
Seller Marks and shall amend  the  relevant Organizational Documents of each
Subsidiary to change the name of  each  Subsidiary to a name that does not
include any Seller Mark or any name or  term  confusingly similar to any

OF SELLER  TO  BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND BY THE  RELATED  DOCUMENTS, AND THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, COVENANTS,  UNDERSTANDINGS OR AGREEMENTS, ORAL OR WRITTEN, IN
RELATION THERETO BETWEEN  THE  PARTIES OTHER THAN THOSE INCORPORATED HEREIN
AND THEREIN. EXCEPT FOR THE  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN ARTICLE V OF THIS  AGREEMENT, BUYER DISCLAIMS RELIANCE ON ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,  EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY OR ON BEHALF
OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR  REPRESENTATIVES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE

THE PRESENCE OR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IN  THE  FIXTURES, SOILS,
GROUNDWATER, SURFACE WATER OR AIR ON, UNDER OR ABOUT OR  EMANATING FROM ANY
OF THE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS OF SELLER OR ANY  SUBSIDIARY.

 

 

**Section  6.6** **Transition  Plan.** ****

 

 

Within  15  days after the execution date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller  a  list of its proposed representatives to a joint
transition team, which shall  include individuals with expertise from various
functional specialties  associated or involved in providing billing, payroll
and other support services  provided to the Business by any automated or
manual process using facilities  or  employees that are not included among
the Assets or Transferred Employees.  Seller will add its representatives to
such team within 15 days after receipt  of  Buyer's list. Such team will be
responsible for preparing as soon as reasonably  practicable after the
execution date of this Agreement, and timely implementing,  a transition plan
that will identify and describe substantially all of the  various transition
activities that the parties will cause to occur before  and  after the
Closing and any other transfer of control matters that any party  reasonably
believes should be addressed in such transition plan, including  the 
matters set forth on _Exhibit  6.6_.  Buyer  and Seller shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their  Representatives on such
transition team to cooperate in good faith and take  all  reasonable steps
necessary to develop a mutually acceptable transition plan  by  no later
than 60 days after the date of this Agreement. The terms and conditions 
governing such transition activities will be more fully set forth in a 
transition services agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement")
reasonably  satisfactory to the parties, including the matters set forth on
_Exhibit  6.6_ ,  to be  executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller at the
Closing.

 

 

**Section  6.7** **Purchase  of Leased Assets.** ****

 

 

Buyer  and  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for
Buyer, on  the  Closing Date, to enter into new lease agreements covering
the motor vehicles  and  other equipment listed on _Schedule  6.7_   and 
leased by the lessors to Seller and/or any Subsidiary as identified on 
_Schedule  6.7_   (the "Leased Assets"), or if unable to do so, then for
Buyer to

 


 

 

 

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

purchase  any Leased Assets directly from any such lessor on, or promptly
after, the  Closing Date upon Buyer's payment directly to any lessor of the
purchase price  for any of the Leased Assets under the applicable lease. Each
party shall  be  responsible for one-half of any related transfer,
registration, sales tax  or  similar fees associated with the transfer of
such leases from Seller to  Buyer.

 

 

**Section  6.8** **Meter  Reading.** ****

 

 

On  and  prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall read the customer meters in
their  normal  cycle and in due course render the related bills to its
customers served  by the  Business. Seller shall also read each daily read
transportation customer  meter  (collectively, "Large Volume Meters") on the
day immediately preceding the  Closing Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with
the last meter reading from  each  of the Large Volume Meters made on the
day immediately preceding the Closing  Date as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date,  Buyer shall read the customer meters
for their first time, in the normal  cycle,  and in due course render bills
for service during the period between Seller's  last reading in the normal
cycle and Buyer's first reading in the normal cycle  to the customers. Buyer
shall determine the volume of gas sold by Seller  prior  to the Closing Date
through Large Volume Meters by Seller's meter readings on  the day
immediately preceding Closing Date. Buyer shall determine by allocation  the
volumes of gas sold by Seller through all meters other than Large Volume 
Meters, prior to the Closing Date, and the gas sold by Seller, on and after 
the  Closing Date and prior to its first meter reading through meters
without  charts.  Such allocation shall be consistent with Seller's past
practices for unbilled  revenues. Once such determinations have been made by
Buyer, the estimated  amounts of accounts receivable and earned but unbilled
revenue and any other  related payables or liabilities shall be adjusted
based upon such determinations  for purposes of the Working Capital
adjustment.

 

 

**Section  6.9** **Insurance.**

 

 

(a) At  Buyer's request, Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to assert  and diligently pursue all rights to insurance coverage under the
Policies  (other  than with respect to Workman's Compensation and punitive
damage policies) and  any  past  insurance policies of Seller relating to
the Business or the Assets (such  Policies  and past insurance  policies
shall collectively be referred to herein as the "Insurance Policies")  with
respect to insured claims asserted  prior to the Closing **** for  matters
included in the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(v).  Seller 
retains  the exclusive right, in its sole discretion, to make and settle
insurance  claims  under past insurance policies for all  matters, 
whether  relating to Assumed Liabilities or Retained Liabilities. As part of
any such  settlement(s), Seller may relinquish all rights in and to such past
insurance  policies with respect to such matters, including Assumed
Liabilities. Seller  shall remit to Buyer insurance proceeds (net of Seller's
costs and expenses)  obtained by Seller after Closing with respect to such
insured claims allocable  to the Assumed Liabilities, as determined by the
insurers with whom such  claims  are settled (or in the absence of such
allocation by the insurers, by Seller  in  proportion to the weight
attributable to the claims related to the Assumed  Liabilities to the
totality of Seller's claims to such insurers), but in no  event shall Buyer
be entitled to receive more than $4,000,000 (net of Seller's  costs and
expenses) in the aggregate in respect of the Business under such  past 
insurance policies. Subject to the preceding sentence, Seller agrees to use 
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate with

 


 

 

 

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

each  of  its insurance companies in order to provide Buyer the benefit of
the coverage  under the Policies for all claims asserted on or after the
Closing Date (to  the  extent available) and to cooperate with Buyer with
any efforts to obtain "tail" coverage, all at Buyer's sole cost, with
respect to any "claims made policies." Seller shall provide access to Buyer
to all of the non-privileged information  relating to these matters and shall
consult with Buyer on the progress thereof  from time to time.

 

 

(b) After  the  Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for, and neither Seller
nor any of its  Affiliates shall have any responsibility for, the payment of
any deductible  amounts or underlying limits attributable to the Insurance
Policies for claims  relating to Assumed Liabilities. Buyer acknowledges that
certain of the  Insurance Policies may require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to provide  an  indemnity to the insurance carrier for deductible
amounts and to provide  collateral to secure such indemnity obligations.
Buyer shall enter into an  indemnification agreement in form mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Seller  wherein Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller or any of its  Affiliates (as applicable) for any and all of
the costs of maintaining such  collateral and for any charges made against
such collateral or indemnification  payments in connection with claims
arising or alleged to arise from the  operations of the Business required to
be paid by Seller of any of its  Affiliates (as applicable) under or with
respect to such Insurance Policies  from  and after the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) Seller  makes no representation or warranty with respect to the
applicability, validity  or adequacy of any Insurance Policies, and Seller
shall not be responsible  to  Buyer or any of its Affiliates for the failure
of any insurer to pay under  such  Insurance Policy.

 

 

(d) Nothing  in this Agreement is intended to provide or shall be construed
as providing  a  benefit or release to any insurer or claims service
organization of any  obligation under any Insurance Policy. Nothing herein
shall be construed  as  creating or permitting any insurer or claims service
organization the right  of  subrogation against Seller or Buyer or any of
their Affiliates in respect  of  payments made by one to the other under any
Insurance Policy.

 

 

**Section  6.10** **Risk  of Loss.** ****

 

 

The  risk  of any loss, damage, impairment, confiscation or condemnation of
any of the  Assets from any cause whatsoever shall be borne by Seller at all
times prior  to  the Closing, and by Buyer at all times thereafter. If any
such loss, damage,  impairment, confiscation or condemnation occurs, Seller
shall apply the proceeds  of any insurance policy, judgment or award with
respect thereto to impair,  replace or restore the Assets as soon as possible
to their prior condition;  _provided,  however_ ,  anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller  shall not be
obligated to expend sums in excess of the proceeds of any insurance  policy,
judgment or award with respect to any loss, damage, impairment,  confiscation
or condemnation of any of the Assets in order to repair, replace  or 
restore such Assets to their prior condition. The provisions of this Section 
6.10 shall apply in the event ("Casualty Event") of any damage or destruction
to  the Assets which would result in the nonsatisfaction of a condition
precedent  to  Buyer\'s obligation to consummate this Agreement. If a
Casualty Event shall  occur, Buyer at its option, may proceed to close this
Agreement on the Closing  Date, in which event Seller shall pay or assign to
Buyer the proceeds from  any  insurance policies

covering  Assets subject to the Casualty Event to the extent such proceeds
are received  by  or payable to Seller and have not been used in or
committed to the restoration  or replacement of Assets subject to the
Casualty Event as of the Closing  Date.

 

 

**Section  6.11** **Outstanding  Payments and Bank Accounts.**

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) all of
the bank accounts and  lock  boxes of Seller used in or in connection with
the Business shall be considered  "Assets" for the purposes of this Agreement
and shall be transferred to Buyer at  the Closing, (ii) any checks that are
in the possession of Seller at the  Closing  that relate to accounts
receivable (or any other asset) included in the Assets  shall be transferred
to Buyer at the Closing and (iii) any checks that are  in  the possession of
Seller at the Closing that relate to accounts receivable  (or  any other
asset) not included in the Assets shall be retained by  Seller.

 

 

(b) From  and  after the Closing, (i) if Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives or collects  any funds relating to any accounts receivable (or any
other asset) included  in  the Assets, Seller or its Affiliates shall remit
any such amounts to Buyer  as  promptly as practicable but no later than ten
(10) days after Seller or any  of  its Affiliates receives such sum, and
(ii) Seller and its Affiliates shall  promptly forward all mail, remittances,
receipts or other mailings received  by  any of them relating to the
Business to Buyer.

 

 

**Section  6.12** **Collective  Bargaining Agreements.** ****

 

 

Seller  has advised Buyer that Seller (a) intends to negotiate a renewal or
extension  of  that certain collective bargaining agreement listed on
_Schedule  6.12(a)_   and (b)  intends to negotiate an early renewal or
extension of that certain collective  bargaining agreement listed on
_Schedule  6.12(b)_.  Seller  agrees to negotiate such renewals or
extensions diligently to achieve  commercially reasonable terms and
conditions consistent with past practice.  Seller shall give Buyer access to
all information relating to the renewals  or  extensions of any such
collective bargaining agreement and shall permit Buyer  to  consult with
Seller and its counsel on the progress thereof from time to  time. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have discretion to conduct such 
negotiations in the manner consistent with the foregoing standards, but
Seller  shall not enter into any such renewal or extension without the prior
written  consent of Buyer , such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

 

 

**Section  6.13** **Alternative  Proposals.**

 

 

(a) Seller  agrees that it shall not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates
and its and  its  Affiliates\' respective Representatives not to, (i)
directly or indirectly  initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of  furnishing information) any inquiries or the making or
submission of any  proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an  Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations  with, or disclose any non-public information or
data relating to Seller or  any  of its Affiliates or afford access to the
properties, books or records of  Seller  or any of its Affiliates to any
Person that has made an Alternative Proposal  or  to any Person in
contemplation of an Alternative Proposal, or (iii) accept  an  Alternative
Proposal or enter into any agreement, including any letter of  intent,

agreement,  option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other  similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting
or related  to,  or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to

fail to  consummate the sale and transfer of the Assets and Stock to Buyer or
any  other  transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Seller  shall advise Buyer in writing promptly (but in no event more than
the later  of  24 hours after Seller\'s or any Affiliate\'s receipt thereof)
of (i) any request  for information by any Person in contemplation of an
Alternative Proposal,  (ii)  any Alternative Proposal received from any
Person, (iii) the terms and  conditions of any such request or proposal, and
(iv) the identity of the  Person  or group making any such request,
Alternative Proposal or inquiry, and Seller  shall promptly provide to Buyer
copies of any written materials received  in  connection with any of the
foregoing.

 

 

(c) For  purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any
bona fide  proposal, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or
indirect acquisition  or purchase of any assets that constitute 10% or more
of the net revenues,  net  income or the assets (based on the fair market
value thereof) of the Business,  or (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of any of the Stock;  _provided,  however_ ,  that "Alternative
Proposal" shall not be deemed to include any proposal to engage in  any
merger, consolidation, restructuring, or other business combination 
transaction, sale of shares of capital stock (other than any tracking or 
similar  shares related in whole or in part to the Business or any part
thereof),  tender  offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase
program or other  similar transaction involving Seller, so long as such
transaction would not  result in Seller ceasing to own and conduct all or any
part of the Business  or  ceasing to own all or any part of the Assets or
Stock.

 

 

(d) Immediately  after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller
shall, and shall  instruct its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to,  terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties  conducted heretofore with respect to any
possible Alternative Proposal.

Closing:

 

 

(a) By  the  mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

 

(b) By  Buyer,  on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, in writing if
there shall  be in  effect a nonappealable Order prohibiting, enjoining or

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

part  of  the other party, which breach is not cured within 30 days
following receipt  by  the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the terminating  party,  or which breach, by its nature, cannot be
cured prior to the Closing;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  this 
Section 9.1(c) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together 
with  all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such
representation  not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under Section  7.2(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or
warranty by Seller)  or  Section 7.1(a) (in the case of a breach of
representation or warranty by  Buyer)  and _provided,  further_ ,  that 
the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, 
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein;

 

 

(d) By  either  party in writing if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the  covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the
part of the other  party, which breach shall not have been cured within 30
days following receipt  by the breaching party of written notice of such
breach from the terminating  party, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be
cured prior to the Closing  (provided that the terminating party is not then
in material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained  herein);

 

 

(e) By  either  party in writing if the Closing has not occurred by August
25, 2006 (the "Upset  Date"); _provided,  however,_   that the  right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) will not be  available to
any party that is in material breach of its representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein; and provided further  that  in the
event either party\'s conditions precedent to Closing set forth in  Sections
7.1(d) or 7.1(e) or Sections 7.2(d) or 7.2(e) have not been satisfied  prior
to the Upset Date but are reasonably capable of being satisfied  thereafter,
then either party may, following written notice to the other,  extend  the
Upset Date in thirty day increments (up to an aggregate of 120  days);

 

 

(f) By  Seller, if at Closing Buyer fails to make the payments required to be
made  by  Buyer at Closing; or

 

 

(g) By  Buyer,  on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, in writing if

obtaining  such Seller's Stockholder Approval or any adjournment or
postponement thereof;  _provided_   that the  right to terminate this

**Section  9.2** **Limitation  on Right to Terminate; Effect of
Termination.**

 

 

(a) A  party  shall not be allowed to exercise any right of termination
pursuant to Section  9.1 if the event giving rise to the termination right
shall be due to the  willful failure of such party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform  or  observe in any material respect any of the
covenants or agreements hereunder  to  be performed or observed by such
party.

 

 

(b) If  this  Agreement is terminated as permitted under Section 9.1, such
termination  shall  be without liability of or to any party to this
Agreement, or any shareholder  or  Representative of such party;
_provided,  however,_   that if  such termination shall

 


 

 

 

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

result  from the willful failure of any party to fulfill a condition to the
performance  of any other party or to perform a covenant of this Agreement or
from a material  and willful breach by any party to this Agreement (it being
understood that  the  failure to cure a breach shall not, by itself, be a
willful breach of this  Agreement), then such party shall (subject to the
last sentence of this Section  9.2(b)) be fully liable for any and all
damages sustained or incurred by  the  other party. If prior to Closing
either party to this Agreement resorts to  legal  proceedings to enforce
this Agreement, the prevailing party in such proceedings  shall be entitled
to recover all costs incurred by such party including  reasonable attorney's
fees, in addition to any other relief to which such party  may be entitled;
_provided,  however,_   and  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 9.2(b), in no event  shall either party be entitled to receive
any punitive, exemplary, special,  remote, speculative, indirect or
consequential damages (including any damages  on  account of lost profits or
opportunities) in connection with any termination  of  this Agreement.

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  X**

 

 

 

**EMPLOYEE  MATTERS**

 

 

**Section  10.1** **Employee  Agreement.** ****

 

 

The  parties have addressed the transfer of employees and employee benefit
matters  in  a separate agreement, entitled Employee Agreement, executed and
delivered  of  even date herewith, the terms and provisions of which
agreement are incorporated  into this Agreement as if fully set forth herein
and a copy of which is attached  hereto as _Exhibit  10.1_  
(the "Employee Agreement").

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  XI**

 

 

 

**TAX  MATTERS**

 

 

**Section  11.1** **Purchase  Price Allocation.** ****

 

 

Within  180 days after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use their
good faith  efforts to agree upon the allocation (the "Allocation") of the
Purchase Price to  the individual assets or classes of assets within the
meaning of Section  1060 of  the IRC and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. If Buyer and Seller agree  to  such Allocation, Buyer and Seller
covenant and agree that (a) the values  assigned to the assets by the
parties' mutual agreement shall be conclusive and  final for all purposes,
(b) neither Buyer nor Seller will take any position  before any Governmental
Body or in any Proceeding that is in any way  inconsistent with such
Allocation and (c) Buyer and Seller shall file all  federal, state, local and
foreign Tax Returns and IRS Forms 8594 and 8883  (and  any similar forms
required for state or local Tax purposes) in accordance  with  the
Allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer and Seller cannot 
agree  to an Allocation, Buyer and Seller covenant and agree to file, and to
cause  their respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and schedules
thereto  (including, for example, amended returns, claims for refund, and
those returns  and forms required under Section 1060 of the IRC and any
Treasury regulations  promulgated thereunder) consistent with each of such
party's good faith  Allocations, unless otherwise required because of a
change in any Legal  Requirement. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to provide
the other promptly  with  any other information reasonably required to
complete Form 8594 and Form  8883  (and any similar forms required for state
or local Tax

purposes).  Each of Buyer and Seller shall notify the other in the event of
an examination,  audit or other proceeding regarding the Allocation
determined under this  Section  11.1.

 

 

**Section  11.2** **Cooperation  with Respect to Like-Kind Exchange.** ****

 

 

Buyer  agrees that Seller may, at Seller's election prior to the Closing
Date, direct  that all or a portion of the Purchase Price be delivered to a
"qualified  intermediary" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1031(k) - 1(g)(4)) in  order to enable Seller's relinquishment of the
Assets to qualify as part of a  like-kind exchange of property covered by
Section 1031 of the IRC. If Seller  so  elects, Buyer shall cooperate with
Seller in connection with Seller's efforts to  effect such like-kind
exchange, which cooperation shall include, without  limitation, taking such
actions as Seller requests in order to enable Seller  to  qualify such
transfer as part of a like-kind exchange of property covered  by  Section
1031 of the IRC (including any actions required to facilitate the  use of  a
"qualified intermediary"); _provided,  however_ ,  that  Buyer shall have
no obligation to take (or agree to take) any action that,  in  its
reasonable discretion, may create any adverse consequences to Buyer, 
including but not limited to adverse Tax, financial or regulatory
consequences  for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything  herein, the structuring of the transactions in a
manner that qualifies the  transactions as part of a like-kind exchange shall
not be a condition to  Closing. Buyer agrees that Seller may assign all or
part of its rights and  delegate all or part of its obligations under this
Agreement to a person  or  entity acting as a qualified intermediary to
qualify the transfer of the  Assets  as part of a like-kind exchange of
property covered by Section 1031 of the  IRC.  Any and all representations,
obligations, agreements, warranties and covenants  made by Seller to Buyer in
connection with this Agreement shall remain in  full  force and effect and
continue to inure to the benefit of Buyer, notwithstanding  any assignment of
this Agreement to a third party in connection with such  Section 1031
exchange. Nothing in this Section 11.2 shall in any manner relieve  Seller
from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and Seller shall  remain 
primarily liable to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Buyer 
and  Seller agree in good faith to use reasonable efforts to coordinate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any other transactions
engaged  in by either Buyer or Seller; provided that such efforts do not
result in  an  unreasonable delay in the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement. Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless from any out-of-pocket  cost or expense (including but not limited
to legal fees, opinions of counsel  or  other costs incurred in implementing
any transaction under this Section 11.2),  or any obligation or liability
incurred by Buyer in connection with any action  taken by Buyer under Section
11.2 or such Section 1031 exchange. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
in this Section 11.2, in no event shall Seller transfer  title to any of the
Assets to any Person other than directly to Buyer or  its  designee.

 

 

**Section  11.3** **Transaction  Taxes.** ****

 

 

All  transfer, documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use, registration,
stamp  and  other similar taxes, fees and expenses (including, but not
limited to, all  applicable stock transfer, real estate transfer or gains
Taxes and including  any  penalties, interest and additions to such tax)
("Transaction Taxes") incurred in  connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall  be  borne one-half by Buyer and one-
half by Seller, regardless of whether the  Tax  authority seeks to collect
such Taxes from Seller or Buyer. Buyer and Seller  shall cooperate in timely
making and filing all Tax Returns as may be required  to comply with

 


 

 

 

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

the  provisions of laws relating to such Transaction Taxes. Seller shall
prepare  all  tax filings related to any Transaction Taxes. Fifteen days
prior to making  such  filings, Seller shall provide to Buyer Seller's work
papers for Buyer's review  and approval. Buyer shall also be responsible for
(a) administering the  payment of such Transaction Taxes, (b) defending or
pursuing any proceedings  related thereto and (c) paying any expenses related
thereto. Seller shall  give  prompt written notice to Buyer of any proposed
adjustment or assessment of  any  Transaction Taxes with respect to the
transaction, or of any examination  of said  transaction in a sales, use,
transfer or similar Tax audit. In any proceedings,  whether formal or
informal, Seller shall permit Buyer to participate and  control  the defense
of such proceeding and shall take all actions and execute all  documents
required to allow such participation. Seller shall not negotiate  a 
settlement or compromise of any Transaction Taxes without the prior written 
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed.

 

 

**Section  11.4** **Real  and Personal Property Taxes.** ****

 

 

All  real  (including public utility realty tax) and personal property Taxes
and  assessments arising with respect to the Assets and the assets of
Subsidiary  and  any similar utility Taxes of any other jurisdiction shall
be prorated between  Buyer and Seller based on the relative periods of time
the Assets were owned  by  each respective party or their respective
Affiliates during the fiscal period  for which such Taxes are imposed by the
applicable taxing jurisdiction (as  such  fiscal period is or may be
reflected on the bill rendered by such taxing  jurisdiction, but in the case
of Taxes imposed based on the specific day  of  ownership of assets, a
fiscal period shall be deemed to be the 365 day period  ending with such
date). Upon receipt by Buyer of the tax bill, invoice or  other  statement
regarding such real and personal property Taxes, Buyer shall calculate  the
_pro  rata_   share of  such tax bill, invoice or other statement
attributable to Buyer and Seller.  Buyer then shall forward, as soon as
practicable, to Seller a copy of such  tax  bill, invoice or statement along
with the supporting documentation relating  to  the calculation of the
_pro  rata_   share to  Seller. Seller then shall forward to Buyer payment
in immediately available  funds of its _pro  rata_   share of  such Taxes
as soon as practicable in advance of the due date of the tax bill,  invoice
or statement and in time to avoid the incurrence of penalties or  interest.
Upon its receipt of such payment, Buyer will pay the full amount  of  the
tax bill, invoice or statement to the applicable taxing authority. In  the 
event Seller first receives a tax bill, invoice or statement relating to 
the  Assets from a taxing authority, Seller shall immediately forward such
tax  bill,  invoice or statement to Buyer.

 

 

**Section  11.5** **Other  Taxes.** ****

 

 

Except  as  otherwise provided in Sections 11.3 and 11.4, Seller shall
indemnify Buyer  from  and against and in respect of any and all losses
incurred by Buyer, which  may be  imposed on, sustained, incurred or
suffered by or assessed against Buyer,  directly or indirectly, to the extent
relating to or arising from (a) all  Taxes  (or the non-payment thereof) of
Seller and its Subsidiaries or with respect  to  the Assets for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and,  with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period  deemed  to end on and
include the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (b) all Taxes  of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of  which 
Seller or any its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) 
is  or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to
Treasury  Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or

foreign  law or regulation, (c) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than
Seller  and  its Subsidiaries) imposed on Seller or its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or  successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which  Taxes  relate to an event or transaction occurring on or
before the Closing, (d)  any  Taxes of Seller that do not relate to the
Business or the Assets purchased  pursuant to this Agreement, and (e) any
breach or inaccuracy in the  representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.9.

 

 

**Section  11.6** **Straddle  Period.** ****

 

 

In  the  case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing  Date  (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or  receipts of Seller and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall  be  determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business  on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership  or other pass-through entity in which
Seller or its Subsidiaries holds a  beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time) and the amount  of  other Taxes of Seller and its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates  to  the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for  the  entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is  the  number of
days in the taxable period ending on and including the Closing  Date  and
the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle  Period.

 

 

**Section  11.7** **Cooperation  on Tax Matters.** ****

 

 

Buyer,  the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent  reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of  Tax  Returns pursuant to this Article XI and any audit,
litigation or other  proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention  and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of
records and information  that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding  and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide  additional information and explanation of any
material provided  hereunder.

 

 

**Section  11.8** **Tax  Returns.** ****

 

 

Except  as  otherwise provided in Sections 11.3 and 11.4,

 

 

(a) Seller  shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
(including  extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the
Seller or  the  Subsidiaries with respect to the Assets or Subsidiaries for
taxable years  or  periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and Seller
shall remit or cause  to  be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. All such Tax Returns  shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice.

 

 

(b) Buyer  shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due
all Tax  Returns that are required to be filed by the Subsidiaries or with
respect  to the  Assets for taxable years or periods ending after the
Closing Date, and Buyer  shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax  Returns.

(c) Upon  the  written request of Buyer setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount  owed, Seller shall pay to Buyer, no later than
five (5) days prior to the  due  date for the applicable Tax Return, the
Taxes for which Seller is liable  pursuant to Section 11.5 but which are
payable with any Tax Return to be  filed  by Buyer with respect to any
Straddle Period.

 

 

**Section  11.9** **Effect  of Indemnity Payments.** ****

 

 

Buyer  and  Seller hereby agree that any and all indemnity payments made
pursuant to  this  Agreement shall, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, be treated  for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 

 

**Section  11.10** **Survival  of Obligations.** ****

 

 

Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of
Buyer and Seller  set  forth in this Article XI shall not be subject to any
restrictions or limitations  other than those expressly set forth in this
Article XI and shall survive  the  Closing.

 

 

**Section  11.11** **Dispute  Resolution.** ****

 

 

In  the  event that Seller and Buyer disagree as to the amount or
calculation of any  payment to be made under this Agreement relating to
Taxes, or the interpretation  or application of any provision under this
Agreement relating to Taxes, the  Parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If such dispute  is  not resolved within sixty (60)
days following the commencement of the dispute,  Seller and Buyer shall
jointly retain a nationally recognized law or accounting  firm, which firm is
independent of both parties (the "Independent Firm"), to  resolve the
dispute. The Independent Firm shall act as an arbitrator to resolve  all
points of disagreement and its decision shall be final and binding upon 
all  parties involved. Following the decision of the Independent Firm,
Seller  and  Buyer shall each take or cause to be taken any action necessary
to implement  the  decision of the Independent Firm. The fees and expenses
relating to the  Independent Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

 

 

**Section  11.12** **Termination  of Tax Agreements.** ****

 

 

All  Tax  allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar agreements
between Seller  or  any of its Affiliates (other than the Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and  the  Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated
with respect to the  Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, and, after the
Closing Date, neither  Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Subsidiaries), on the one  hand,  nor the Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
shall be bound thereby or have any  further liability or obligation
thereunder to the other party with respect  to  periods prior to the Closing
Date.

if any, regardless of when such Losses are finally determined or  (ii) the
date on which the matter described in such Claim Notice has  otherwise
reached final resolution, including the determination of all related  Losses,
if any, regardless of when such Losses are finally determined. In  no  event
shall any amounts be recovered from Seller under Section 12.1 or otherwise 
for any matter for which a Claim Notice is not delivered to Seller prior  to
the  close of business on the applicable expiration date set forth  above.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller indemnify  the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in any
way whatsoever to the  Buyer  Indemnitees, for any Losses (determined after
giving effect to the other  provisions of this Section 12.3) otherwise
subject to indemnification by  Seller  pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (other
than in respect of any claim for any  inaccuracy or breach (or deemed
inaccuracy or breach) of the representations  and  warranties contained in
the first two sentences of Section 5.4(a) or in Sections  5.5(a) or (c),
which claims shall not be subject to the limitations set forth  in  this
Section 12.3(d)) until the Buyer Indemnitees have incurred Losses otherwise 
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.1(a) that in the aggregate exceed Five 
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) **** (the  "Deductible"), after which Seller
shall then be liable for all Losses incurred  by the Buyer Indemnitees that
are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.1(a)  in  excess of such amount up
to the maximum amount set forth in Section 12.3(e).  Losses subject to
indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (other  than in respect
of any claim for any inaccuracy or breach (or deemed inaccuracy  or breach)
of the representations and warranties contained in the first two  sentences
of Section 5.4(a) or in Section 5.5(a)) relating to any single  breach  or
series of related breaches by Seller shall not constitute Losses, and 
therefore shall not be applied toward the Deductible or be indemnifiable 
hereunder, unless such Losses relating to any single breach or series of 
related  breaches exceed $20,000.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in no
event shall Seller  indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable
in any way whatsoever  to  the Buyer Indemnitees, for any Losses (determined
after giving effect to  the  other provisions of this Section 12.3)
otherwise subject to indemnification  by  Seller pursuant to Section 12.1(a)
(other than in respect of any claim for  any  inaccuracy or breach (or
deemed inaccuracy or breach) of the representations  and  warranties
contained in the first two sentences of Section 5.4(a) or in Sections  5.5(a)
or (c)) that in the aggregate exceed One Hundred Million Dollars 
($100,000,000), and (ii) in no event shall Seller indemnify the Buyer 
Indemnitees, or be otherwise liable in any way whatsoever to the Buyer 
Indemnitees, for any Losses (determined after giving effect to the other 
provisions of this Section 12.3) otherwise subject to indemnification by 
Seller  pursuant to Section 12.1(a) (solely in respect of any claim for any
inaccuracy  or breach (or deemed inaccuracy or breach) of the representations
and warranties  contained in the first two sentences of Section 5.4(a) or in
Sections 5.5(a)  or  (c)) that in the aggregate exceed the Purchase Price;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the event Seller makes any
indemnification payment to any Buyer Indemnitee  for  any Loss pursuant to
Section 12.1(a), regardless of whether such claim is  for  any inaccuracy or
breach (or deemed inaccuracy or

breach)  of the representations and warranties contained in the first two
sentences  of  Section 5.4(a) or in Sections 5.5(a) or (c), then the amount
of such payment  shall be credited against each of the limitations set forth
in clause (i)  and  clause (ii) of this Section 12.3(e).

 

 

(f) Seller  shall have no liability for any portion of any claim or Loss for
which (i)  Buyer  receives or is entitled to receive (and which are
collectible) any insurance  proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment from any  other  insurer or other third party (whether in a
lump sum or stream of payments)  or  (ii) Buyer recovers or is entitled to
recover through rates, provided that  Buyer  shall have made a good faith
effort to recover any such claim or loss through  rates and that such
recovery is not indeterminable due to the terms of any  rate  settlement
agreed to by Buyer. No cost or expense relating to any such claim  or  Loss
that is actually recovered on the basis of the foregoing shall be included 
in determining the extent of Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees for 
purposes of Section 12.3(c) or Section 12.3(d). Buyer agrees to use its 
commercially reasonable efforts to give timely and effective written notice 
to  the appropriate insurance carrier(s) of any occurrence or circumstances
that,  in  the judgment of Buyer consistent with its customary risk
management practices,  appear likely to give rise to a claim against Buyer
that is likely to involve  one or more insurance policies of Buyer. Any such
notice shall be given in  good  faith by Buyer without regard to the
possibility of indemnification payments  by  Seller under Section 12.1, and
shall be processed by Buyer in good faith  and in  a manner consistent with
its risk management practices involving claims for  which no third party
contractual indemnification is available. Buyer agrees  that  (x) if it is
entitled to receive payment from Seller for a Loss, and  (y) if Buyer has
obtained insurance that may cover the claim or matter  giving rise to such
Loss, then (z) such insurance shall be primary coverage  and Buyer will make
a claim under such insurance (if such claim can be made  in  good faith)
before enforcing its right to receive payment from Seller. If  at any  time
subsequent to the receipt by a Buyer Indemnitee of an indemnity payment  from
Seller hereunder, such Buyer Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof) receives 
any recovery, settlement or other similar payment with respect to the Loss 
for  which it receives such indemnity payment, such Buyer Indemnitee shall
promptly  pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such recovery, less
any expense  incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in
connection with  such  recovery, but in no event shall any such payment
exceed the amount of such  indemnity payment.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding  any language contained in any Related Document
(including deeds and other  conveyance documents relating to the Real
Property), the representations  and  warranties of Seller set forth in this
Agreement will not be merged into  any  such Related Document and the
indemnification obligations of Seller, and  the  limitations on such
obligations, set forth in this Agreement shall control.  No  provision set
forth in any such Related Document shall be deemed to enlarge,  alter or
amend the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

**Section  12.4** **Limitation  on Buyer 's Liability.** ****

 

 

EXCEPT  TO  THE EXTENT ARISING OUT OF FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER BE
LIABLE TO THE  SELLER  INDEMNITEES FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,  REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES; _provided, 
however,_   that if  Seller is held liable to a third party for any of such
damages and Buyer  is  obligated to indemnify Seller for the matter that
gave rise to such damages,  then Buyer shall be liable for, and obligated to
reimburse Seller for, such  damages.

**Section  12.5** **Claims  Procedure.**

 

 

(a) All  claims for indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, or any other
provision  of  this Agreement except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement,  shall  be asserted and resolved pursuant to this Article XII.
Any Person claiming  indemnification hereunder is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party" and any  Person against whom such claims are asserted
hereunder is hereinafter referred  to as the "Indemnifying Party." In the
event that any Losses are asserted  against or sought to be collected from or
threatened to be sought from an  Indemnified Party by a third party,
including a Governmental Body, said  Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness provide to the Indemnifying  Party a Claim Notice. The
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify  the Indemnified Party
with respect to any such Losses if the Indemnified  Party  fails to notify
the Indemnifying Party thereof in accordance with the provisions  of this
Agreement in reasonably sufficient time so that the Indemnifying  Party's 
ability to defend against the Losses is not prejudiced. The Indemnifying 
Party  shall have 30 days from the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim
Notice  (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or
not it  disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party  hereunder with respect to such Losses and/or (ii) whether or not it 
desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend 
the  Indemnified Party against such Losses; _provided,  however,_   that
any  Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice
Period  to  file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall
reasonably deem  necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those
of the Indemnifying  Party (and of which it shall have given notice and
opportunity to comment  to the  Indemnifying Party) and not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party. In the  event  that the Indemnifying Party notifies
the Indemnified Party within the Notice  Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Losses,  the  Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to defend all appropriate proceedings,  and with counsel of its own
choosing, which proceedings shall be promptly  settled or prosecuted by them
to a final conclusion. If the Indemnified Party  desires to participate in,
but not control, any such defense or settlement  it  may do so at its sole
cost and expense. If requested by the Indemnifying  Party,  the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and  its  counsel in
contesting any Losses that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest  or, if
appropriate and related to the claim in question, in making any  counterclaim
against the Person asserting the third party Losses, or any  cross-complaint
against any Person. No claim may be settled or otherwise  compromised without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying  Party.

 

 

(b) The  Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the
Indemnifying  Party  and provide access to its books, records and personnel
as the Indemnifying  Party  reasonably requests in connection with the
investigation or defense of the  Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall
promptly upon receipt of reasonable  supporting documentation reimburse the
Indemnified Party for out-of-pocket  costs  and expenses incurred by the
latter in providing the requested  assistance.

 

 

(c) With  regard to third party claims for which Buyer or Seller is entitled
to  indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, such indemnification shall
be  paid  by the Indemnifying Party upon (i) the entry of an Order against
the Indemnified  Party and the expiration of any applicable appeal period or
(ii) a settlement  with the consent of the

 


 

 

 

-  -

 



 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

Indemnifying  Party, provided that no such consent need be obtained if the
Indemnifying  Party  fails to respond to the Claim Notice as provided in
Section 12.5(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section
12.5(a), and provided  that  there is no dispute as to the applicability of
indemnification, expenses  of  counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be
reimbursed on a current basis by  the  Indemnifying Party as if such
expenses are a liability of the Indemnifying  Party.

 

 

**Section  12.6** **Exclusive  Remedy.** ****

 

 

Except  (i) for claims arising out of fraud or criminal misrepresentation,
and (ii)  as  otherwise provided in Sections 3.2(b), 6.4, 9.2 or 11.11, the
rights, remedies  and obligations of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees set forth  in  this Article XII will be the exclusive rights,
remedies and obligations of  such  Persons after the Closing with respect to
all post-Closing claims relating  to  this Agreement, the events giving rise
to this Agreement and the transactions  provided for herein or contemplated
hereby or thereby. Except as provided  above,  no Proceeding for termination
or rescission, or claiming repudiation, of  this  Agreement may be brought
or maintained by either party against the other  following the Closing Date
no matter how severe, grave or fundamental any  breach, default or
nonperformance may be by one party. Accordingly, except  as  otherwise
provided in this Section 12.6, the parties hereby expressly waive  and 
forego any and all rights they may possess to bring any such  Proceeding.

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  XIII**

 

 

 

**GENERAL  PROVISIONS**

 

 

**Section  13.1** **Expenses.** ****

 

 

Except  as  otherwise specifically provided herein, each party will pay all
costs and  expenses of its performance of and compliance with this Agreement,
_provided,  however_ ,  that  notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer will pay  the  filing fees associated with the HSR
Act.

 

 

**Section  13.2** **Notices.** ****

 

 

All  notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing  and  shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt if either (a)
personally  delivered with written acknowledgment of such receipt, (b) sent
by prepaid  first  class mail, and registered or certified and a return
receipt requested, as  of  the date such receipt indicates by signature, (c)
sent by overnight delivery  via  a nationally recognized carrier with
written acknowledgment of such receipt  or  (d) by facsimile with, and as of
the date of, completed transmission being  acknowledged:

**Section  13.3** **Assignment.** ****

 

 

This  Agreement may not be assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party  hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto,
such  consent  not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided,  however,_   in
the  event of any such assignment by a party by operation of law without the
consent  of the other party as required above, such other party may consent
to such  assignment after it has occurred and, in such event, this Agreement
and all  the  provisions hereof shall be binding upon the Person receiving
such assignment  by  operation of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
may assign all or  part  of its rights or delegate all or part of its duties
under this Agreement,  without the prior written consent of Buyer, to a
qualified intermediary chosen  by Seller to structure all or part of the
transactions contemplated hereby  as a  like-kind exchange of property
covered by Section 1031 of the IRC; provided  that  no such assignment or
delegation shall relieve Seller of its obligations  hereunder, and Seller
shall remain primarily liable to Buyer pursuant to  the  terms of this
Agreement.

 

 

**Section  13.4** **Successor  Bound.** ****

 

 

Subject  to the provisions of Section 13.3, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and  inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective

**Section  13.5** **Governing  Law.** ****

 

 

The  validity, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement and all
Related  Documents, unless expressly provided to the contrary, shall be
governed by  the  laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the
principles of  conflicts of law of such state.

 

 

**Section  13.6** **Cooperation.** ****

 

 

Each  of  the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take  or  cause to be taken all action, and to do or cause to be
done all things  necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws,
regulations or otherwise,  to consummate and to make effective the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, including the timely
performance of all actions and things  contemplated by this Agreement to be
taken or done by each of the parties  hereto.

 

 

**Section  13.7** **Construction  of Agreement.** ****

 

 

The  terms  and provisions of this Agreement represent the results of
negotiations between  Buyer and Seller, each of which has been represented by
counsel of its own  choosing, and neither of which has acted under duress or
compulsion, whether  legal, economic or otherwise. Accordingly, the terms and
provisions of this  Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with their usual  and  customary meanings, and Buyer and Seller
hereby waive the application in  connection with the interpretation and
construction of this Agreement of  any  rule of law to the effect that
ambiguous or conflicting terms or provisions  contained in this Agreement
shall be interpreted or construed against the  party  whose attorney
prepared the

executed  draft or any earlier draft of this Agreement. It is understood and
agreed  that  neither the specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and  warranties contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion
of any specific  item in  the Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply
that such amounts or higher  or  lower amounts, or the items so included or
other items, are or are not material,  and none of the parties shall use the
fact of the setting of such amounts  or the  fact of any inclusion of any
such item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any  dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation,  item or  matter is or is not
material for purposes hereof. The word "including" in this  Agreement shall
mean including without limitation. Words in the singular  shall  be held to
include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall  be  held to
include the other genders as the context requires. The terms
"hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise  stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all  of the  Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and not to any
particular provision of this  Agreement, and Article, Section, paragraph,
Exhibit and Schedule references  are  to the Articles, Sections, paragraphs,
Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement  unless otherwise specified.

 

 

**Section  13.8** **Publicity.** ****

 

 

Neither  party hereto shall issue, make or cause the publication of any press
release  or  other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereby, or otherwise make any disclosures relating
thereto,  without  the consent of the other party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld  or  delayed; _provided,  however,_   that  such
consent shall not be required where such release or announcement is  required
by applicable law or the rules or regulations of a securities exchange,  in
which event the party so required to issue such release or announcement 
shall  endeavor, wherever possible, to furnish an advance copy of the
proposed release  to the other party.

 

 

**Section  13.9** **Waiver.** ****

 

 

Except  as  otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the
failure nor any  delay on the part of any party to exercise any right, power
or privilege  hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial  exercise or waiver of any such right, power or privilege
preclude any other  or  further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege  available to each party at law or in equity.

 

 

**Section  13.10** **Parties  in Interest.** ****

 

 

This  Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is  not  intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto
and their  successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder
_provided,  however_ ,  that  the indemnification provisions in Article XII
shall inure to the benefit  of the  Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees as provided therein.

 

 

**Section  13.11** **Section  and Paragraph Headings.** ****

 

 

The  section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for reference
purposes  only  and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this  Agreement.

**Section  13.12** **Amendment.** ****

 

 

This  Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing executed by
the  parties hereto.

 

 

**Section  13.13** **Entire  Agreement.** ****

 

 

This  Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the documents
specifically  referred to herein and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire  agreement, understanding, representations and warranties of the
parties hereto,  and supersede all prior agreements, both written and oral,
between Buyer  and  Seller. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or
referred to herein are  hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth  in full  herein. Disclosure of any fact or item
in any Schedule referenced by a  particular paragraph or Section in this
Agreement shall, should the existence  of  the fact or item or its contents
be relevant to any other paragraph or Section,  be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to that other paragraph or Section  whether or not any explicit
cross-reference appears therein but only to the  extent that such relevance
is clearly and readily apparent from the face  of such  disclosure;
_provided,  however_ ,  that  notwithstanding the foregoing, no disclosures
shall be deemed to be disclosed  on  _Schedule  5.21_   except  for such
disclosures explicitly set forth thereon or explicitly incorporated  by 
reference into _Schedule  5.21_.

 

 

**Section  13.14** **Counterparts.** ****

 

 

This  Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall
be  deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and
the  same  instrument.

 

 

**Section  13.15** **Severability.** ****

 

 

If  any  term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable  of  being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions  and  provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and  effect  so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated  hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon  such  determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable  of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify  this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely  as  possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated  hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

 

 

**Section  13.16** **Consent  to Jurisdiction.** ****

 

 

The  parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts  of  the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan and
the federal  courts of the United States of America located in the Southern
District of  the  State of New York over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement  or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and each party irrevocably  agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute
or proceeding shall be  heard  and determined in such courts. The parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the  fullest extent

permitted  by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to  the  venue of any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any  of the  transactions contemplated hereby brought in such
court or any defense of  inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each party agrees  that a  judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit  on  the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable law.

compensation, on an  approved leave of absence (including an approved leave
of absence with  a legal  or contractual right to reinstatement, military

the Closing Date (except as provided in the  following sentence), with at
least the same level of Base Compensation  as was in  effect for each such

circumstance, provided that such offer of employment shall remain  open  no

of an approved  leave  of absence or otherwise under the preceding sentence
shall not be considered  a  Transferred Employee hereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller and  Buyer  agree that the Employees listed in
Schedule 2.3(a) may have the opportunity  to  continue employment with

Employees  who  accept Buyer's offer of employment, except that each Absent
Employee shall be  deemed employed by Buyer as of 12:01 a.m. on the Absent
Employee's Start  Date.

 



 

(b)  In  the event that (1) on the Closing Date or during the Continuation
Period,  the  employment of a Transferred Employee (other than a Transferred
Employee  covered  by a collective bargaining agreement) is terminated by
the Buyer or an  Affiliate  of Buyer, other than For Cause, or (2) during
the Continuation Period,  Buyer  fails to provide a Transferred Employee
(other than a Transferred Employee  covered by a collective bargaining

responsible for and shall pay to such Transferred Employee,  in a  lump sum
payment, not later than sixty (60) days following the date of  the 
Transferred Employee's

employment for each  full or partial year of service, measured from the
Transferred Employee's date  of hire reflected in Schedule 1.1, not to exceed
fifty-two (52) weeks of  such  Base Compensation; provided, however, that in
no event shall such Severance  Benefit be less than six (6) weeks of such
Base Compensation. The costs  incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection
with the termination of  employment of any Transferred Employee on or after
the Closing Date shall  be  borne exclusively by Buyer. Buyer's obligation
to provide the Severance Benefits  shall be subject to the Transferred
Employee executing a release of all  claims  against the Buyer and its
Affiliates, and the Seller and its Affiliates,  in a  form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer.

 

 

**Section  2.5** **Prior  Service Credit.**   On and  after the Closing
Date, for each Transferred Employee not covered by a  Collective Bargaining
Agreement and, to the extent consistent with Section  2.2,  each Transferred
Employee covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement,  Buyer  and its
Affiliates shall recognize service for Seller, a former owner of  the 
Business, or an Affiliate of either, prior to the Closing Date, for all 
employee  benefit and employment-related purposes, other than for purposes of
defined  benefit plans and post-retirement health, dental and life insurance
benefits  (except as required by Section 3.1 or Section 4.6).

 



 

**Section  2.6** **Vacation.**   Buyer  shall permit each Transferred
Employee to carry forward (to the same extent  allowed to be carried forward
by Seller) and to receive paid time off for  all  vacation days (including
sick days and personal days) accrued prior to  the  Closing Date. As soon as
administratively feasible following execution  of the  Sale Agreement,
Seller shall provide to Buyer a list reflecting the paid  time  off balances
standing to the credit of each Transferred Employee as of  the date  of the
Sale Agreement. Seller shall provide Buyer with a revised list,  updated  as

her account balance under Seller's 401(k) Plan,  including his or her loan
balances and related loan documentation; provided  that  a Transferred
Employee shall only be permitted to roll over his or her  loan  balances and
related loan documentation if the Transferred Employee makes  a  rollover or
direct rollover of all of his or her account balance under  Seller's  401(k)
Plan. If the Transferred Employees will be eligible to participate  in 
Buyer's 401(k) Plan, the trustee or recordkeeper of Seller's 401(k) Plan
shall  transfer to the trustee or recordkeeper of Buyer's 401(k) Plan any
loan  documentation for loans to be rolled over or transferred to Buyer's
401(k)  Plan. ****   The  Transferred Employees shall not be required to
roll over, or otherwise  transfer,  their account balances under Seller's
401(k) Plan to Buyer's 401(k) Plan. 

 



 

**Section  3.3** **Nonqualified  Deferred Compensation Plans and Individual
Deferred Compensation and Other  Arrangements.** Except  as  provided in

the  five (5)  nonqualified deferred compensation plans listed in Item 1 of
