2.6 _Required Consents_. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from Third
Parties or Governmental Entities, and that such consents have not been and may
not be obtained. From and after the date hereof, the parties hereto shall have
a continuing obligation to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other and to obtain promptly all authorizations,
approvals, consents, negative clearances or waivers of Third Parties or,
following the Closing, Governmental Entities as may be required to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to repay any indebtedness for
borrowed money, amend any Contract to increase the amount payable thereunder
or otherwise to be materially more burdensome to Seller or any of its
Affiliates, commence any litigation, offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any Third Party or Governmental Entity, pay any
amount or bear any other incremental economic burden (other than of a de
minimis nature) to obtain any such authorization, approval, consent, negative
clearance or waiver; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no party hereto shall
incur any expense that would be payable by any other party hereto without the
consent of such other party. Purchaser agrees that neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever arising out of or relating
to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the default under, or acceleration or termination of, any Assumed Contract,
Permit or other Purchased Asset, as a result thereof. Purchaser further
agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained herein
shall be breached or deemed breached, and, no condition to PurchaserÂ’s
obligations to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
deemed not satisfied as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such consent
or as a result of any such default, acceleration or termination or (ii) any
lawsuit, action, claim or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consent or any such default, acceleration or termination.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery or
attempted sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery to Purchaser of
any Purchased Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
Third Party or any Governmental EntityÂ’s authorization, approval, consent,
negative clearance or waiver and such authorization, approval, consent,
negative clearance or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the
Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment or delivery, or an attempted sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment
or delivery of such Purchased Asset. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in any
commercially reasonable and economically feasible arrangement to provide that
Purchaser shall receive the interest of Seller or its Affiliates in the
benefits under such Purchased Asset and shall be responsible for the
liabilities of Seller under, and the obligations of Seller with respect to,
the Assumed Liabilities. Following the Closing, the obligations of the parties
hereto to seek any authorizations, approvals, consents, negative clearances or
waivers as set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_ shall continue, and, upon obtaining
the requisite authorization, approval, consent, negative clearance or waiver,
Seller shall promptly convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be
conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, such Purchased Asset to
Purchaser hereunder.

 



 

2.7 _Bifurcation of Purchase Agreement._

 



 

(a) The purpose of this _Section 2.7_ is to expedite the Closing by December
31, 2013 of the majority of the Transaction if that is practical and to
expedite the Closing of the remainder of the Transaction as soon as it is
thereafter practical.

 



 

(b) If, at any time during the HSR waiting period, Seller reasonably believes,
based on the partiesÂ’ interactions with, and information received from,
Antitrust Authorities and consultation with the Purchaser, that the Closing
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ will not be able to be satisfied
prior to December 31, 2013 with respect to the purchase and sale of either or
both of SellerÂ’s Syracuse and Rochester Terminals, (but that all Closing
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ are likely to be satisfied or waived by
December 31, 2013 with respect to all other Purchased Assets), then,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless prohibited
by a Governmental Authority, (i) Seller may, acting reasonably and in good
faith, to fulfil the purpose set forth in _Section 2.7(a)_, by written notice
to Purchaser, require that the parties enter into any amendments or other
modifications to this Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto
reasonably deemed necessary by the parties in order to reflect the exclusion
of such Terminal(s) and all other Purchased Assets related thereto (the "
**Carved-Out Assets** ") and all Assumed Liabilities related to such Carved-
Out Assets (together with the Carved-Out Assets, the " **Carved-Out Assets and
Liabilities** ") from this Agreement; and (ii) any amendment to this Agreement
for the purpose of excluding Carved-Out Assets and Liabilities shall include a
decrease in the Initial Purchase Price by the portion of the value of the
Carved-Out Assets set forth in _Section 2.7_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
that is agreed by the parties to be allocable to such Carved-Out Assets (the "
**Bifurcated Purchase Price** ").

 



 

(c) As soon as necessary to satisfy the purpose set forth in _Section 2.7
(a)_ and as soon as otherwise reasonably practicable following the execution
of any amendment to this Agreement for the purpose of excluding Carved-Out
Assets and Liabilities pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.7(a)_, the parties shall enter into a separate purchase agreement
with respect to the Carved-Out Assets and Liabilities, which agreement shall
be substantially in the form of this Agreement, including its Schedules and
Exhibits, in each case as modified by the parties, acting reasonably and in
good faith, to apply solely to the Carved-Out Assets and Liabilities. The
purchase price for the Carved-Out Assets shall equal the Bifurcated Purchase
Price.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _PURCHASE PRICE_

 



 

3.1 _Purchase Price; Delivery of Funds_. (a) At least three (3) Business Days,
but not more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " **Estimated Closing
Statement** ") setting forth SellerÂ’s good faith estimate of (i) the Closing
St. Lucia Working Capital (the " **Estimated Closing St. Lucia Working
Capital** ") and (ii) the Closing Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value (the " **Estimated Closing Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value** "), which statement shall quantify in reasonable detail the estimates
of the items constituting such Estimated Closing St. Lucia Working Capital and
such Estimated Closing Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, in
each case calculated, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and _Exhibits C_ and _D_ , as applicable. During the period
after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement and prior to the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall have an opportunity to review the Estimated Closing
Statement and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in good faith to mutually
agree upon the Estimated Closing Statement if Purchaser disputes any item
proposed to be set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement; _provided_ ,
that, if Seller and Purchaser are not able to reach mutual agreement prior to
the Closing Date, the Estimated Closing Statement provided by Seller to
Purchaser shall be binding for purposes of this _Section 3.1_, but not, for
the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in full consideration for
the sale and transfer by Seller of the Purchased Assets (subject to the
adjustments set forth in _Section 3.2_ and _Section 6.17_), the Initial
Purchase Price, such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) Commencing on the Closing Date, the volume and quality of the Purchased
St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory (the " **Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon
Inventory Count** ") shall be assessed by an independent inspector (the "
**St. Lucia Field Inspector** ") appointed by Seller and Purchaser and
mutually acceptable to both parties. The Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon
Inventory Count shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Exhibit C_. Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled, at their respective
own expense, to have Representatives present for the Purchased St. Lucia
Hydrocarbon Inventory Count so long as such Representatives do not interfere
with the tasks or responsibilities of the St. Lucia Field Inspector. The
parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the St. Lucia Field Inspector to issue a written report (the " **Purchased St.
Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory Report** ") to both Seller and Purchaser within
five (5) days after the Closing Date setting forth the St. Lucia Field
InspectorÂ’s final determination of the volume and quality of Purchased St.
Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Closing Date. The fees and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses of the St. Lucia Field Inspector shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

 



 

3.2 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. (a) Within thirty (30) days of the Inventory
Results Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "
**Closing Statement** ") setting forth SellerÂ’s good faith calculations ("
**Seller Â’s Proposed Calculations**") of (i) the Closing St. Lucia Working
Capital, (ii) the Closing Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory Value
based on the Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory Report and (iii) the
Closing St. Lucia Working Capital Adjustment and the Purchase Price Adjustment
based on such amounts. The Closing St. Lucia Working Capital shall be prepared
in accordance with the policies and procedures for determining Target Closing
St. Lucia Working Capital as set forth in _Exhibit D_. The Closing Purchased
St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory Value shall be prepared in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Exhibit C_. After the Closing Date and until the
Final Purchase Price has been finally determined, Purchaser shall provide
Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the Conveyed EntitiesÂ’ auditors and accounting and other personnel
and to the books and records of the Conveyed Entities, as the case may be, and
any other document or information reasonably requested by Seller, and
necessary in order to allow Seller and its Representatives to prepare SellerÂ’s
Proposed Calculations.

 



 

(b) If Purchaser does not object to SellerÂ’s Proposed Calculations by written
notice of objection (the " **Notice of Objection** ") delivered to Seller
within thirty (30) days after PurchaserÂ’s receipt of SellerÂ’s Proposed
Calculations, the calculation of the Closing St. Lucia Working Capital
Adjustment and the Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to SellerÂ’s Proposed
Calculations shall be deemed final and binding. A Notice of Objection under
this _Section 3.2(b)_ shall set forth in reasonable detail PurchaserÂ’s
alternative calculations of (i) the Closing St. Lucia Working Capital, (ii)
the Closing Purchased St. Lucia Hydrocarbon Inventory Value and (iii) the
Closing St. Lucia Working Capital Adjustment and the Purchase Price
Adjustment, in each case calculated based on such amounts.

 



 

(c) If Purchaser delivers a Notice of Objection to Seller within the thirty
(30) day period referred to in _Section 3.2(b)_, then any element of SellerÂ’s
Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute on the date such Notice of
Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding and any dispute (all
such amounts, the " **Disputed Amounts** ") shall be resolved as set forth in
this _Section 3.2(c)_:

 



 

(i) Seller and Purchaser shall promptly endeavor in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Amounts listed in the Notice of Objection. If a written agreement
determining the Disputed Amounts has not been reached within ten (10) Business
Days (or such longer period as may be agreed by Seller and Purchaser) after
the date of receipt by Seller of the Notice of Objection, the resolution of
such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (the " **Arbitrator** ").

 



 

(ii) Seller and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Arbitrator to render a decision in accordance with this _Section
3.2(c)_ along with a statement of reasons therefor within thirty (30) days of
the submission of the Disputed Amounts, or a reasonable time thereafter, to
the Arbitrator. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and

 



      
 

 



 

binding upon each party hereto and the decision of the Arbitrator shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(iii) The Purchase Price Adjustment shall be calculated based on each element
of SellerÂ’s Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute and the final
determination of the Arbitrator with respect to the Disputed Amounts and the
Purchase Price Adjustment, as so calculated, shall be deemed to be final and
binding.

 



 

(iv) If Seller and Purchaser submit any Disputed Amounts to the Arbitrator for
resolution, Seller and Purchaser shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred under this _Section 3.2(c)_. Seller shall be responsible for that
fraction of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator where (x) the numerator is
the absolute value of the difference between SellerÂ’s position with respect to
the Purchase Price Adjustment and the Purchase Price Adjustment as calculated
based on the ArbitratorÂ’s final determination with respect to the Disputed
Amounts and (y) the denominator is the absolute value of the difference
between SellerÂ’s position with respect to the Purchase Price Adjustment and
PurchaserÂ’s position with respect to the Purchase Price Adjustment, and
Purchaser shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and costs.

 



 

(v) The Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based on the
provisions of this _Section 3.2(c)_, only the Disputed Amounts and the
determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_. The Arbitrator
shall choose between the position of Seller or the position of Purchaser with
respect to each Disputed Amount.

 



 

(d) The term " **Final Purchase Price Adjustment** " shall mean the final and
binding Purchase Price Adjustment calculated pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ or
_3.2(c)_ , as the case may be. The term " **Final Purchase Price** " shall
mean the Initial Purchase Price, _plus_ the absolute value of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment, if such amount is a positive number, or _minus_ the
absolute value of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment, if such amount is a
negative number. The Final Purchase Price Adjustment shall be treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price for federal, state, territory, local and
foreign income Tax purposes.

 



 

(i) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price,
then Purchaser shall pay to Seller for the account of Seller the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Initial Purchase Price within three
(3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price, such
amount to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser promptly after the final
determination of the Final Purchase Price.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price, then
Seller shall pay to Purchaser for the account of Purchaser the difference
between the Initial Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price within three
(3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price, such
amount to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Purchaser in writing to Seller promptly after the
determination of the Final Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Initial
Purchase Price, Assumed Liabilities, and any other items constituting
consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent known at such
time) among the Purchased Assets that complies with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder as soon as commercially
practicable (but in any event by the Closing Date (the " **Allocation** ")).
If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on an Allocation by the Closing
Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its own allocation of the Initial
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price, as applicable. If Seller and
Purchaser reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (i) the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Initial Purchase Price or the Final Purchase Price, as applicable, pursuant to
this Agreement, and (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation in all Returns,
including IRS Form 8594, which Purchaser and Seller shall timely file with the
IRS, and neither Seller nor Purchaser shall take any position in any Return
that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, in each case, unless
required to do so by a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code. Each of Seller and Purchaser agree to promptly advise each other
regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to
the Allocation.

 



 

3.4 _Closing; Closing Deliverables_. (a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ and _7.3_ , the

(the " **Seller Disclosure Letter** ") concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (it being agreed that any matter disclosed pursuant to any section
of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of any
other section of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent the applicability
of the disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as
follows:

 



 

4.1 _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. Seller is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Seller and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate the

Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the Purchased Assets owned, leased or
operated by Seller or such Subsidiary of Seller or the nature of the Terminal
Operations makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing does not and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.2 _Authorization; Noncontravention_. (a) Seller and its Subsidiaries have
the requisite corporate, limited liability company, partnership or similar
power and authority, as applicable, and have taken all corporate, limited
liability company, partnership or similar action necessary to execute and
deliver this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to be
delivered by Seller and its Subsidiaries as contemplated hereby and thereby,
to perform their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder and to

this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to be delivered by
Seller and its Subsidiaries as contemplated hereby, the consummation by Seller
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby and the performance of their respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder have been, and in the case of documents required to be delivered at

limited liability company, partnership, stockholder, member, partner or other
action. This Agreement has been, and all other instruments and agreements to
be executed and

 



      
 

 



 

delivered by Seller and its Subsidiaries as contemplated hereby will be, duly

valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and each other Person (other than
Seller and its Subsidiaries) party thereto, this Agreement and all such other
instruments and agreements constitute valid and binding obligations of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, enforceable against such Person in
accordance with the terms thereof, except to the extent that such enforcement
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditorsÂ’
rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by Seller and its Subsidiaries as contemplated
hereby do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby will not (i) conflict with any of the provisions of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar governance documents of
Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case as amended to the
date of this Agreement, (ii) subject to receipt of the consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings and notices set forth in _Section
4.2(b)_ and _Section 4.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, conflict with or
result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any Assumed Contract or
other instrument by which the Purchased Assets are bound or (iii) subject to
(x) the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and (y) receipt of the consents, approvals, authorizations,

Subsidiaries or by which any of the Purchased Assets are bound, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches, defaults,
consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings or notices which
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. Assuming all required Antitrust Filings are made

consents required thereunder have been obtained, except as set forth in

Property. There are no other real properties owned by Seller or any of its

Property, subject only to Permitted Liens. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
condemnation proceeding is pending or has been threatened with respect to any
Owned Real Property which has had or would reasonably be expected to have,

Third Parties under any Permitted Liens.

or any portion of any Terminal (collectively, the " **Real Property Leases**
"), and sets forth the role of Seller and each of its Subsidiaries party
thereto. True and correct copies of the Real Property Leases and all
amendments, modifications, supplements and extensions thereof have been made
available by Seller to Purchaser. With respect to each Real Property Lease
pursuant to which the Seller or its Subsidiary party thereto is a lessee or
sublessee or in which Seller has an undivided fifty percent (50%) interest as
tenant-in-common as lessee or sublessee by virtue of its ownership of the
Syracuse Interest, Seller or such Subsidiary has valid leasehold interests (or
a valid undivided fifty percent (50%) leasehold interest as tenant-in-common
by virtue of SellerÂ’s ownership of the Syracuse Interest, as applicable) in
all leased real property described in such Real Property Lease, free and clear
of any and all Liens, except for Permitted Liens and Liens which will be
satisfied at or prior to the Closing. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
condemnation proceeding is pending with respect to any real property subject
to a Real Property Lease which has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No party to
any Real Property Lease has exercised any option or right to (i) terminate
such Real Property Lease prior to the end of the term thereof, (ii) lease
additional premises pursuant to such Real Property Lease, (iii) reduce or
relocate the premises demised by such Real Property Lease or (iv) purchase any

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

4.6 _Assumed Contracts_. Seller has provided or made available to Purchaser
true and complete copies of each material Assumed Contract (other than any
Assumed Contract to which any of the Conveyed Entities is a party or by which

**Conveyed Entity Contract** ")) and each material Conveyed Entity Contract.
Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (a) Seller and
its Subsidiaries are not in breach of or default under any Assumed Contract
(other than any Conveyed Entity Contract) or any material Conveyed Entity
Contract, (b) to the Knowledge of Seller, (i) no other party to any Assumed
Contract (other than any Conveyed Entity Contract) or any material Conveyed
Entity Contract is in breach of the terms thereof and (ii) no event or
circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default under the same or result in a termination thereof. No
Assumed Contract (other than any Conveyed Entity Contract) or material
Conveyed Entity Contract has been terminated by any party thereto. Except for
any Assumed Contract which has expired in accordance with its terms prior to
the Closing Date, each Assumed Contract (other than any Conveyed Entity
Contract) and each material Conveyed Entity Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of Seller or its Subsidiary party thereto, enforceable against such
party in accordance with the terms thereof, except to the extent that such
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER_

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (the " **Purchaser Disclosure
Letter** ") delivered by Purchaser to Seller concurrently with the execution
of this Agreement (it being agreed that any matter disclosed pursuant to any
section of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed for
purposes of any other section of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter to the extent
the applicability of the disclosure to such other section is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), Purchaser hereby represents and
warrants to Seller as follows:

partnership power and authority and has taken all partnership or other action
necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other instruments and

contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to be
delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby, the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the performance of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder have been, and in the case of documents
required to be delivered at the Closing will be, duly authorized and approved
by the board of directors of the general partner of Purchaser. This Agreement
has been, and all other instruments and agreements to be executed and
delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby will be, duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser. Assuming that this Agreement and all such other
instruments and agreements constitute valid and binding obligations of Seller
and each other Person (other than Purchaser) party thereto, this Agreement and
all such other instruments and agreements constitute valid and binding
obligations of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with the

Laws affecting the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and by general
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, (i)
conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws or similar governance documents of Purchaser, in each case, as amended to
the date of this Agreement, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of, or
constitute a default under, any Contract or other instrument to which
Purchaser

or (iii) subject to (x) the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any
other applicable Antitrust Laws and (y) receipt of the consents, approvals,

5.3_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, contravene any Law or any Order
applicable to Purchaser or by which any of its properties or assets are bound,
except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts,
breaches, defaults, consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings
or notices which do not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or impair PurchaserÂ’s ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.3 _Consents and Approvals_. Assuming all required Antitrust Filings are made
and any waiting periods thereunder have been terminated or expired and any
consents required thereunder have been obtained, except as set forth in
_Section 5.3_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, no consent of or filing
with any Governmental Entity or any other Person, must be obtained or made by
Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Purchaser or the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for any consents, approvals, authorizations or filings,
which have been obtained or made or, if not made or obtained, do not and would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent,
materially delay or impair PurchaserÂ’s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.4 _Available Funds_. Purchaser has and will have on the Closing Date
unrestricted cash available to it and access to proceeds under PurchaserÂ’s
credit facility in place on the date hereof (including, if necessary, by

accordance with the terms thereof) sufficient to pay all amounts to be paid or
repaid by Purchaser under this Agreement (whether payable on or after the
Closing) and all of PurchaserÂ’s and its AffiliatesÂ’ fees and expenses
associated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, proceeding at law or in equity, or

Person pending, or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing,
against or affecting Purchaser or any of its properties or rights, except as
have not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent, materially delay or impair PurchaserÂ’s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser is not
subject to any Order which seeks to or would reasonably be expected to,

PurchaserÂ’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

5.6 _Finders; Brokers_. No agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of

fees, finderÂ’s fees or commissions from Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Representatives, financing sources or Affiliates has, without the prior
written consent of Seller, directly or indirectly contacted any officer,
director, employee, shareholder, supplier, distributor, customer or other

Operations prior to the Closing for the purpose of discussing the Terminal
Operations in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

5.8 _Investment Intent_. (a) Purchaser is acquiring the Hess LLC Interest and
the HOSLLP LP Interests for its own account, for investment purposes only and
not with a view toward, or for sale in connection with, any distribution

LLC Interest or the HOSLLP LP Interests, in violation of the U.S. federal
securities Laws or any applicable non-U.S. or state securities Law.

 



 

(b) Purchaser qualifies as an "accredited investor," as such term is defined
in Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) Purchaser understands that the acquisition of the Hess LLC Interest and
the HOSLLP LP Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement involves substantial risk. Purchaser and its officers have
experience as investors in securities and Equity Interests of companies such
as the ones being transferred pursuant to this Agreement, and Purchaser can
bear the economic risk of its investment (which may be for an indefinite
period) and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters
that Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment
in the Hess LLC Interest and the HOSLLP LP Interests to be acquired by it
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) Purchaser understands that the Hess LLC Interest and the HOSLLP LP
Interests to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement have not been
registered under the Securities Act. Purchaser acknowledges that such
securities may not be transferred, sold, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act and any other provision of applicable state securities Laws or
pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom. Purchaser acknowledges that
there is no public market for the Hess LLC Interest and the HOSLLP LP
Interests and that there can be no assurance that a public market will
develop.

 



 

5.9 _Investigation by Purchaser_. Purchaser has conducted its own independent
investigation, verification, review and analysis of the Terminal Operations
and of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, technology and prospects of the Terminal
Operations, which investigation, review and analysis was conducted by
Purchaser and its Affiliates and, to the extent Purchaser deemed appropriate,
by PurchaserÂ’s Representatives. Purchaser acknowledges that it and its
Representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Terminal Operations and of the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. In entering into this Agreement,
Purchaser acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned
investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual representations or
opinions of Seller (except the specific representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in this Agreement), and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, that:

 



 

(a) except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, none of Seller or any
of its shareholders, Affiliates, Representatives or any other Person makes or
has made any oral or written representation or warranty, either express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information made available
or delivered Purchaser or its Affiliates and Representatives,

 



      
 

 



 

including any information, whether oral or written (including cost estimates,
financial information and projections and other projections and forward-
looking statements) (i) included in management presentations, "break-out"
discussions, responses to questions submitted by or on behalf of Purchaser or
its Affiliates and Representatives, or any "data room" or (ii) delivered or
made available pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_ or otherwise;

 



 

(b) except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, none of Seller or any
of its shareholders, Affiliates, Representatives or any other Person shall

shareholders, Affiliates or Representatives on any basis (including in
contract, tort or equity, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise)
based upon any information described in _Section 5.9(a)_;

 



 

(c) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller makes no
representation or warranty regarding (and Purchaser disclaims) any Third Party
beneficiary rights or other rights which Purchaser might claim under any
studies, reports, tests or analyses prepared by any Third Parties for Seller
or any of its Affiliates, even if the same were made available for review by
Purchaser or its shareholders, Affiliates or Representatives; and

 



 

(d) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser expressly
acknowledges and agrees that none of the documents, information or other
materials provided to them at any time or in any format by Seller, or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives constitute legal advice, and Purchaser (i)
waives all rights to assert that it received any legal advice from Seller, any
of its Affiliates, or any of their respective Representatives, or that it had
any sort of attorney-client relationship with any of such Persons, and (ii)
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, and each of
their respective Representatives against any such assertion made by or on
behalf of Purchaser or its shareholders, Affiliates or Representatives.

 



 

5.10 _Acknowledgment by Purchaser_. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY
SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER TO PURCHASER IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND

oral or written communications made by Purchaser with any applicable Antitrust
Authority; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such
Antitrust Authority or Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby other than responding to telephone calls from any
Antitrust Authority, unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Antitrust
Authority or Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to
attend, and furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings
and written communications between them and their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, on one hand, and any such Antitrust Authority or

requested by any Antitrust Authority with respect to Antitrust Laws in
connection with granting any necessary clearance or terminating any applicable
waiting period, including (i) agreeing to sell, divest, hold separate,
license, cause a Third Party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of all or any
part of any Purchased Asset(s) contemporaneously with or after the Closing and
regardless as to whether a Third Party purchaser has been identified or
approved prior to the Closing (a " **Divestiture** "), (ii) taking or
committing to take such actions as are ancillary to a Divestiture or other
reasonable actions that may limit Purchaser or its AffiliatesÂ’ freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, all or any part of any
Purchased Asset(s) (such as firewall and non-discrimination restrictions) and
(iii) entering into any Order, consent decree or other agreement to effectuate
any of the foregoing.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither this _Section 6.3_ nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall
require or obligate Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to, prior to the entry
of an order preliminarily or permanently enjoining this Transaction, (a) sell,
license, divest or dispose of or hold separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise) any entities, assets, Intellectual Property rights or
businesses of Purchaser or the Seller (or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates) or (b) agree to any restriction on its conduct. The Purchaser
and Seller shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay or prevent the Closing by
the End Date.

 



 

(g) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are enjoined, whether
preliminarily or permanently (other than through a temporary restraining
order), as a result of any injunction, judgment or other order in any action
or proceeding brought by any Antitrust Authority that seeks to prevent the
Closing as a violation of any Antitrust Law, if requested by the relevant
Antitrust Authorities, Purchaser shall, pursuant to _Section 6.3(e)_, agree
to (a) a Divestiture and (b) restrictions on its conduct, in order to effect
the dissolution or lifting of any such injunction or other order and to
satisfy the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)_.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser agrees that it shall:

business relationship that constitutes a part of the Purchased Assets as may
be required to obtain any necessary clearance of any Antitrust Authority or to
obtain termination of any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust Laws;

 



 

(ii) consult with Seller in connection with any decision to extend any waiting
period or enter into any agreement or understanding with any Antitrust
Authority to extend any waiting period, including by way of pulling and
refiling the Notification and Report Form required under the HSR Act.
Following consultation with Seller,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser shall not enter into any such extension without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and

 



 

(iii) oppose fully and vigorously any request for the entry of, and seek to
have vacated or terminated, any Order, judgment, decree, injunction or ruling
of any Antitrust Authority that could restrain, prevent or delay the Closing,
including by defending through litigation (including by retaining all
appropriate expert witnesses and consultants), any action asserted by any
Person in any court or before any Antitrust Authority and by exhausting all
avenues of appeal, including appealing properly any adverse decision or Order
by any Antitrust Authority. Seller shall be permitted to participate in all
aspects of the defense of such proceedings and Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to prevail in such proceedings. Purchaser shall be
responsible for the payment of its own expenses, including legal fees and
expenses, in seeking to prevent the entry of any such Order.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not be required to agree to take any action set forth in

agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the Purchase or any other transaction contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the
consummation of the Purchase or any other transaction contemplated hereby;
(iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal
or otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the Purchase or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(k) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under
the HSR Act.

 



 

(l) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.3(a)_, Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives
to, cooperate and take, or cause to be taken, all steps required under the
Port Reading Consent Decree to make the terms, conditions, obligations and
liabilities of the Port Reading Consent Decree applicable to the Purchaser,
including (i) timely notifying all required Governmental Entities of the
Purchase, (ii) Purchaser and Seller executing a modification to the Port
Reading Consent Decree pursuant to which Purchaser shall assume the terms,

obligations and liabilities (the " **Consent Decree Modification** ") and
obtaining the appropriate signatures thereto of all Governmental Entities
party to the Port Reading Consent Decree, (iii)

limited liability company authority, evidence of mergers, consolidations and

required by PurchaserÂ’s title insurance company, duly executed by Seller or
the appropriate Subsidiary of Seller.

 



 

6.4 _Public Announcements_. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, each shall (a) consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) provide to the other party
for review a copy of any such press release or public statement and (c) not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and review and the receipt of the prior consent of the other
party to this Agreement, unless required by applicable Law or regulations of
any applicable stock exchange, in which case, the party required to issue the
press release or make the public statement shall, prior to issuing such press
release or making such public statement, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
statement to the extent practicable. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall limit any partyÂ’s right
to make public statements about its respective actions under _Section 9.1_
without prior consultation with the other party.

 



 

6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts

Knowledge of Seller, threatened, against Seller or Purchaser, as the case may
be or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

6.6 _Supplements to Schedules_. (a) Seller shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to deliver to Purchaser, from time to time prior to the Closing, a
schedule of changes (each, an " **Update Schedule** ") to any of the
information contained in the Seller Disclosure Letter delivered in connection
with the execution of this Agreement (including changes relating to any
representations or warranties in _Article IV_ as to which no matters have
been set forth in the Seller Disclosure Letter as of the date hereof);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the changes or additions that are the subject of
such Update Schedule may only relate to events that have occurred or
conditions that have come into existence after the date of this Agreement.
Subject to _Section 6.6(b)_, each Update Schedule shall constitute an
amendment of the representation, warranty or statement to which it relates,
and each Update Schedule shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to
supplement and amend the Seller Disclosure Letter (and all references to the
"Seller Disclosure Letter" in this Agreement shall include each such Update
Schedule to the extent applicable), and Purchaser shall not have the right to
make any claim for any breach of representation or warranty arising out of the
information contained in any Update Schedule. Except as set forth in _Section
6.6(b)_, Purchaser shall not have the right to not consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as a result of the failure of the condition
contained in _Section 7.2(b)_ on the basis of the information disclosed in
any Update Schedule.

 



 

(b) If any fact or circumstance disclosed on any Update Schedule would, but
for this _Section 6.6_, permit Purchaser to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1(d)_, then Purchaser shall be entitled to
exercise such right; _provided_ , however, that if Purchaser does not provide
a written termination notice pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ within ten (10)
Business Days after the first date Purchaser is entitled to exercise its
termination right pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_, Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived for all purposes of this Agreement all rights and remedies
hereunder or under applicable Law arising out of or related to the matters
disclosed on such Update Schedule (including their right to not consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby due to the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2_ and their rights set forth in _Article VIII_).

 



 

6.7 _Post-Closing Access to Records and Personnel; Litigation Support_. (a)

prior to the date hereof), Purchaser shall preserve and retain all corporate,
accounting, Tax, legal, auditing, human resources and other books and records
of the Terminal Operations (including (i) any documents relating to any
action, claim, lawsuit, demand, inquiry, hearing, investigation, notice of a
violation or noncompliance, litigation, proceeding, arbitration, appeal or
other dispute and (ii) all Returns, schedules, work papers and other material
records or other documents relating to Taxes of the Terminal Operations)

(b) Following the Closing, the parties hereto will allow each other reasonable
access to (i) the Terminal Operations, Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities, (ii) their books and records related to the Terminal Operations,
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) such personnel having knowledge of the location or contents of such
books and records, for legitimate business reasons; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such access shall unreasonably interfere with SellerÂ’s and PurchaserÂ’s
operation of their respective businesses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be required to provide
any information or access that such Person reasonably believes could violate
applicable Law, including Antitrust Laws, rules or regulations or the terms of
any Contract or cause the waiver of attorney/client or similar privilege. Each
party shall be entitled to recover from the other its out-of-pocket costs
(including copying costs) incurred in providing such books and records or
personnel to the other party. The requesting party will hold in confidence all
confidential information identified as such by, and obtained from, the
disclosing party or any of its Representatives, except as otherwise required
by Law.

 



 

(c) If and for so long as Seller or Purchaser actively is contesting or
defending against any action, claim, lawsuit, demand, inquiry, hearing,
investigation, notice of a violation or noncompliance, litigation, proceeding,
arbitration, appeal or other dispute, brought by a Third Party in connection
with (i) the Purchase or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the
Terminal Operations, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, the non-
contesting or non-defending party or parties shall, at the sole cost and
expense of the contesting or defending party (except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.7(b)_), (x) cooperate with the contesting or defending party and
its counsel in the defense or contest, (y) make available its or their
personnel (including to act as a witness) and (z) provide such access to its
or their books and records as shall be necessary or reasonably requested in
connection with the defense or contests; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
cooperation or access shall unreasonably interfere with such non-contesting or
non-defending partyÂ’s operation of its businesses. All non-public information
received pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall be kept confidential, except as
otherwise required by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no Person shall be required to provide any access that such
Person reasonably believes could violate applicable Law, including Antitrust
Laws, rules or regulations or the terms of any Contract or cause the waiver of
attorney/client or similar privilege. Each party shall be entitled to recover
from the other its out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing such personnel
and access to the other party.

 



 

6.8 _Employee Relations and Benefits_. (a) Purchaser shall make offers of
employment (including continued employment with respect to Business Employees
employed by a Conveyed Entity on the Closing Date) in accordance with this
_Section 6.8_, at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, with such
employment to commence as of the Closing, to each Business Employee, except
for those Business Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are
covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreements set forth on _Exhibit O_, for
the same or a Comparable Position (as defined herein), at a rate of pay at
least equal to such Business EmployeeÂ’s pay in effect on the Closing Date and
benefits which are no less favorable than those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates. For purposes of this _Section
6.8_, references to "pay" shall be limited to base pay. Purchaser shall
provide Affected Employees with commission, bonus, incentive pay, overtime,
premium pay and shift differentials (collectively, " **Additional Pay** ")
which are no less favorable than those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates. A " **Comparable Position** " is a
position with Purchaser or its Affiliates in which (i) the Business EmployeeÂ’s
level of

 



      
 

 



 

responsibilities would not be significantly reduced and (ii) the Business
Employee is not required to relocate more than 25 miles from the Business
EmployeeÂ’s principal business location immediately prior to such relocation.
Purchaser shall have no obligation with regard to former employees who are
retired, or who are not or shall have ceased to be Business Employees as of
the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for all salaries and wages
(including commissions, bonuses, incentive pay, overtime, premium pay, shift
differentials and severance pay) accruing after the Closing Date with respect
to the Affected Employees, and Seller shall be responsible for all such
salaries and wages accruing on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall be
responsible for any severance pay or benefits that accrue under any severance
pay plan or policy of Seller on or prior to the Closing with respect to each
Business Employee, whether or not such Business Employee is also an Affected
Employee. Purchaser agrees that the following conditions of employment shall
remain unchanged until the date immediately following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date: (x) the Comparable Position requirement
described in this _Section 6.8(a)_ and (y) the pay, Additional Pay and
benefits comparability requirements described in this _Section 6.8(a)_;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to be a covenant on the
part of Purchaser not to terminate the employment of any employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be obligated to make an
offer of employment to the individuals set forth on _Section 1.1(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter until Purchaser shall have interviewed such
individuals and shall have determined, based on such interviews, whether or
not Purchaser will make such an offer to such individuals; _provided_ , that
Purchaser shall undertake such interviews and make such determination within
30 days following the date of this Agreement and shall promptly notify Seller
of its determinations; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent Purchaser
determines, in compliance with this sentence, not to make an offer of
employment to any such individual set forth on Section 1.1(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, such individual shall not be considered a Business Employee
for any purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Affected Employees shall be provided credit by Purchaser for all service
with Seller and its Affiliates, based on the hire dates provided to Purchaser
by Seller, under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and benefits
of Purchaser or its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual under such plans, other than benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall permit each Affected Employee who participates in the Hess
Corporation EmployeesÂ’ Savings Plan (the " **Seller 401(k) Plan**") to elect
to make a direct rollover of such Affected EmployeeÂ’s account balance under
the Seller 401(k) Plan to an account under a defined contribution plan
maintained by Purchaser that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
that includes an arrangement described in Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
**Purchaser Savings Plan** "), including the direct rollover of any
outstanding loan balances such that the Affected Employee will continue to
make payments under the terms of such loans under the Purchaser Savings Plan,
subject to compliance with applicable Law , including, but not limited to,
Section 414(l) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall
only permit rollover of outstanding loan balances for an Affected Employee who
rolls over his or her entire account balance under the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(d) Seller shall be responsible for paying the Affected Employees (other than
Affected Employees who are employees of any Conveyed Entity as of the Closing
Date) for any

 



      
 

 



 

vacation due as of the Closing Date under the applicable vacation policy of
Seller or its Affiliates (the " **Seller Vacation Policy** "). Between the
Closing Date and the end of the year in which the Closing Date occurs,
Purchaser covenants that Purchaser, or PurchaserÂ’s Affiliates, shall permit
all such Affected Employees to take the same number of days of vacation on an
unpaid basis as they would have been eligible to take as of the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Seller Vacation Policy based
upon the recognized credited service amounts of such Affected Employees with
Seller or its Affiliates. Seller shall provide Purchaser with a report setting
forth the amount of accrued but unused vacation for each such Affected
Employee as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date within ten (10)
Business Days following the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Coverage for all Affected Employees and their respective spouses and
dependents under all employee welfare benefit plans (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA) provided by Seller or its Affiliates shall cease to be
effective immediately prior to the Closing Date. Commencing on the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall provide coverage and benefits for all Affected Employees
and their respective eligible spouses and dependents under its welfare benefit
plans and shall waive any waiting periods or limitations for preexisting
conditions or other limitations or exclusions from coverage under its welfare
benefit plans (including its medical, dental, prescription drug,
hospitalization, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability plans),
and shall ensure that such employees, spouses and dependents are given credit
for any amounts paid toward deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, out-of-
pocket limits or other fees on or prior to the Closing Date. All claims
incurred with respect to Affected Employees and their eligible spouses and
dependents on and after the Closing Date for welfare benefits shall be the
responsibility of the welfare benefit plans provided by Purchaser. Claims
incurred with respect to Affected Employees (other than under a Conveyed
Entity Plan with respect to Affected Employees who are employees of any
Conveyed Entity as of the Closing Date) and their eligible spouses and
dependents for welfare benefits prior to the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of the welfare benefit plans of Seller. For purposes of this
_Section 6.8(e)_, a claim will be deemed "incurred" on the date that the
event that gives rise to the claim occurs (for purposes of life insurance,
accident and disability benefits) or on the date that treatment, services or
products are provided (in the case of healthcare benefits). Seller shall
provide PurchaserÂ’s group health plan with a report setting forth all
deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, and accumulations toward out-of-pocket
maximums paid by Affected Employees (other than under a Conveyed Entity Plan
with respect to Affected Employees who are employees of any Conveyed Entity as
of the Closing Date), their spouses, and their dependents for the current plan
year under the employee welfare benefit plans provided by Seller or its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall assume responsibility for compliance with the requirements
of Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
any similar state or territory Law (" **COBRA** "), including the provision of
continuation coverage, with respect to all Affected Employees, and their
spouses and dependents, for whom a qualifying event occurs on or after the
Closing Date. The terms "continuation coverage" and "qualifying event" are
used herein as defined in COBRA.

 



 

(g) When a Business Employee (other than a Business Employee who is an
employee of any Conveyed Entity as of the Closing Date) who is, on the Closing
Date, absent due to vacation, illness or on short-term disability (including
maternity disability) or workersÂ’

 



      
 

 



 

compensation seeks to return to active employment prior to the earlier of the
expiration of the permitted time frame under the applicable Seller policy or
required by applicable Law and the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall offer immediate employment to such Business Employee in
the same or a Comparable Position to that which such Business Employee
occupied before such absence but only at such time that such Business Employee
is medically capable of performing the essential functions of the position
occupied immediately before such absence. In addition, immediate employment in
the same or Comparable Positions will be offered by Purchaser to those
Business Employees (other than Business Employees who are employees of any
Conveyed Entity as of the Closing Date) timely returning from authorized
leaves of absence such as parental, family and medical, and military leaves or
other leaves where return to work is subject to statutory requirements. Such
employees, returning from disability, leaves of absence or otherwise, will be
subject to the same pay, benefits, severance and all other policies, plans,
programs and arrangements as required by this _Section 6.8_ for similarly-
situated Business Employees.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall: (i) confer upon any
Business Employee, or any Representative of any such employee, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
period or terms of employment, for any nature whatsoever; or (ii) constitute
or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan for any purpose.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.8_ to
the contrary, Purchaser covenants and agrees to, or to cause its Affiliates
to, (i) for Business Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are
covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, offer employment under the same
terms and conditions described in such Collective Bargaining Agreement, except
for those Business Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are
covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements listed on _Exhibit N_ and
_Exhibit O_, (ii) for Business Employees whose terms and conditions of
employment are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement listed on _Exhibit
N_, offer employment at a rate of pay at least equal to such Business
EmployeeÂ’s pay in effect on the Closing Date and benefits and other terms and
conditions which are no less favorable than those provided to similarly-
situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates, (iii) recognize each labor
union that at the Closing Date represents any Business Employees as the
collective bargaining representatives of such employees, except for those
labor unions party to Collective Bargaining Agreements listed on _Exhibit O_
unless otherwise required by Law, (iv) adopt and assume the obligations of
Seller and its Affiliates under the Collective Bargaining Agreements, except
those Collective Bargaining Agreements listed on _Exhibit N_ and _Exhibit
O_, be bound by and comply with the terms of such Collective Bargaining
Agreements and not undertake any action to avoid the employer obligations
under such adopted and assumed Collective Bargaining Agreements and (v)
execute such documents as may be necessary to effectuate such adoption and
assumption. Purchaser further agrees that from and after the Closing Date,
Seller shall have no further obligation pursuant to those Collective
Bargaining Agreements assumed by Purchaser or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this _Section 6.8_, Purchaser agrees that the
provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall be subject to any applicable
provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements, except for those
Collective Bargaining Agreements listed on

 



      
 

 



 

 _Exhibit N_ and _Exhibit O_, in respect of Affected Employees whose terms
and conditions of employment are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement,
except for those Collective Bargaining Agreements listed on _Exhibit N_ and
_Exhibit O_, to the extent the provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are
inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the provisions of any such
Collective Bargaining Agreement. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnitees with respect to any Losses arising or resulting, in
whole or in part, from any actions taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates prior
to, on or after the Closing Date with respect to Business Employees whose
terms and conditions of employment are covered by the Collective Bargaining
Agreements set forth on _Exhibit O_, including any Losses arising out of the
National Labor Relations Act or any comparable Law.

 



 

(j) Seller or its Affiliates have obligations to contribute to one or more
Union Plans until the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
shall not be required to take any actions under Section 4204 of ERISA in order
to prevent a complete or partial withdrawal of Seller under Section 4203 or
4205 of ERISA from any Union Plan with respect to the operations of the
Terminal Operations because of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and any withdrawal liability imposed upon
Seller in connection with the withdrawal of Seller from any Union Plan shall
be the sole responsibility of Seller.

 



 

(k) Purchaser shall adopt the "alternate procedure" for preparing and filing
IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as described in Revenue Procedure
2004-53, with respect to the Affected Employees for the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs. Under this procedure, (i) Purchaser as the successor
employer shall provide Forms W-2 to Affected Employees reflecting all wages
paid and Taxes withheld with respect to such Affected Employees for the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs and (ii) Seller as the
predecessor employer shall have no employment Tax reporting responsibilities
for the Affected Employees following the Closing Date. Purchaser shall also
adopt the "alternate procedure" of Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for purposes of
IRS Forms W-4 (EmployeeÂ’s Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned
Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate). Seller shall provide such
information as is in its possession to the extent necessary for Purchaser to
implement the provisions of this _Section 6.8(k)_, including all original
current Forms W-4 and Forms W-5 that were provided to the Purchaser by
Affected Employees and any written notices received from the Internal Revenue
Service under Treasury Regulations Section 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(5), to Purchaser
within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith to adopt similar procedures under applicable state,
municipal, county, local or other Laws.

 



 

6.9 _Compliance with WARN and Similar Statutes_. Neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall, at any time within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, effectuate or cause to be effectuated (including, but not limited to, as
a result of aggregating any "employment loss" prior to, on or after the
Closing Date) (a) a "plant closing" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" **WARN** ")) affecting any site of
employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of
employment or facility of the Terminal Operations or (b) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in WARN) affecting any site of employment or facility of the Terminal
Operations; and/or, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), any similar action
under any comparable Law requiring notice to employees in the event of a plant
closing, mass layoff or other action triggering statutory notice requirements.
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees with
respect to any Losses under WARN (and any comparable Law requiring notice to
employees) arising or resulting, in whole or in part,

 



      
 

 



 

from (i) any actions taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date and (ii) "employment losses" with respect to Business Employees
whose terms and conditions of employment are covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreements set forth on _Exhibit O_.

 



 

6.10 _Tax Matters_. (a) All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales and use, value
added, registration and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the Purchase, whether
or not customarily paid by sellers or purchasers (collectively, the "
**Transfer Taxes** "), shall be borne by Seller, and Seller shall properly
file on a timely basis all necessary Returns and other documentation with
respect to any Transfer Tax and provide to Purchaser evidence of payment of
all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(b) All Taxes and Tax Liabilities with respect to the Terminal Operations or
the ownership of the Purchased Assets that relate to the Overlap Period shall
be apportioned between Pre-Closing Periods and Post-Closing Periods as
follows: (i) in the case of throughput Taxes imposed within St. Lucia and Tax
Liabilities attributable thereto, on the basis of the number of barrels (in
respect of which such throughput charges are imposed) exported before the
Closing Date (which throughput Taxes and Tax Liabilities attributable thereto
shall be apportioned to Pre-Closing Periods) and on or after the Closing Date
(which throughput Taxes and Tax Liabilities attributable thereto shall be
apportioned to Post-Closing Periods); (ii) in the case of property Taxes and
Tax Liabilities attributable thereto, on a per diem basis; and (iii) in the
case of Taxes and Tax Liabilities other than throughput charges imposed within
St. Lucia and property Taxes and Tax Liabilities attributable thereto, as
determined from an interim closing of the books or records of the Terminal
Operations at the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Seller shall have the authority and obligation to accurately prepare and
file, or cause to be accurately prepared and filed, all Returns of the
Conveyed St. Lucia Subsidiaries that are due with respect to any taxable year
or other taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. In addition,
Seller shall pay on or prior to the due date, any amount due and payable on
such Returns (except to the extent such amount was taken into account in
calculating the Closing St. Lucia Working Capital).

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall have the authority and obligation to accurately prepare,
or cause to be accurately prepared, all Returns of the Conveyed St. Lucia
Subsidiaries that are due with respect to any Overlap Period. Such Returns
shall be prepared by treating items on such Returns in a manner consistent
with the past practices of the Conveyed St. Lucia Subsidiaries with respect to
such items, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall
permit Seller to review and comment on each such Return. If Seller consents to
such Returns (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
then Purchaser shall cause the Conveyed St. Lucia Subsidiaries to execute and
timely file such Returns.

 



 

(e) Seller or an Affiliate of Seller may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
amend any Return filed or required to be filed by or with respect to the
Conveyed St. Lucia Subsidiaries for any taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor any
Affiliate of Seller shall amend any such Return that materially and adversely
affects or may materially and adversely affect the Tax Liability of Purchaser,
any Conveyed St. Lucia Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the foregoing for any
Post-

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Period, without the prior consent of Purchaser, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(f) Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall amend any Return
(i) with respect to any taxable year or other taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date or (ii) that materially and adversely affects or may
materially and adversely affect the Tax Liability of Seller or any Affiliate
for a Pre-Closing Period, in each case without the prior consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(g) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to forward to
Seller all written notifications and other communications from any taxing
authority received by Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the Conveyed St. Lucia
Subsidiaries relating to Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Period.

 



 

(h) Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refund relating to Taxes with respect
to the Conveyed St. Lucia Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period (except to
the extent the amount of such Tax refund was taken into account in calculating
the Closing St. Lucia Working Capital). Purchaser shall promptly pay the
amount of any such refund to Seller.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Representatives shall have access to the Returns or related workpapers
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that are not Conveyed Entities.

 



 

6.11 _Transition Services_. At the Closing, Seller and Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates will enter into such transition arrangements as are set
forth in the transition services agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit L_ (the " **Transition Services Agreement** "). Purchaser
acknowledges that certain Information Technology is used by the Terminal
Operations (including the Conveyed Entities) on a shared basis under
arrangements made by Seller or its Affiliates. Purchaser agrees that such
Information Technology shall not be used by the Terminal Operations (including
the Conveyed Entities) following the Closing, except as expressly provided in
the Transition Services Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date, or if continued
use of the Information Technology is permitted under the Transition Services
Agreement, the expiration or termination of the Transition Services Agreement,
Purchaser shall and shall cause the Conveyed Entities to remove, disable,
return, and, if directed by Seller, delete all Information Technology that
Purchaser or the Conveyed Entities do not own or directly license from a Third
Party.

 



 

6.12 _Damage or Destruction_. (a) Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to keep all insurance
policies currently maintained with respect to the Terminal Operations, or
suitable replacements or renewals, in full force and effect through the close
of business on the Closing Date. In the event of any material damage to or
destruction of any Purchased Asset (other than normal wear and tear) after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing (in any such case, a " **Casualty Loss**
"), Seller shall give notice thereof to Purchaser. If any portion of such
Casualty Loss is covered by insurance policies, all right and claim of Seller
and its Subsidiaries to any proceeds of insurance for such Casualty Loss shall
be assigned to Purchaser at Closing (or if previously received by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries and not used prior to the Closing Date to repair any
damage or destruction, paid to Purchaser),

 



      
 

 



 

and Purchaser shall complete the Purchase as provided in this Agreement
without any reduction in the Initial Purchase Price with respect to the
portion of such Casualty Loss that is covered by insurance. If any portion of
such Casualty Loss is not covered by insurance policies, at SellerÂ’s election,
(i) Purchaser shall complete the Purchase as provided in this Agreement and
the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to SellerÂ’s
good faith estimate of the cost to repair or restore the Purchased Assets
affected by such uninsured Casualty Loss (the " **Affected Assets** ") to
their condition immediately prior to the occurrence of such uninsured Casualty
Loss (to the extent not so repaired or restored by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries) or (ii) the Affected Assets shall be excluded from the Purchased
Assets and the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
PurchaserÂ’s good-faith estimate of the fair market value of the Affected
Assets immediately prior to the Casualty Loss (the " **Reduction Amount** ").

 



 

(b) (i) If, within thirty (30) days following SellerÂ’s exclusion of Affected
Assets at the Closing pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section 6.12(a)_, Seller
delivers to Purchaser a notice objecting to the Reduction Amount, Seller and
Purchaser shall together select an appraiser within fifteen (15) days after
the expiration of said thirty (30) day period to determine the fair market
value of the Affected Assets immediately prior to the Casualty Loss. If the
parties are unable to agree upon an appraiser by the expiration of such
fifteen (15) day period, each of Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall select its own appraiser within seven (7) days after
such fifteen (15) day period and, if either Seller or Purchaser shall fail to
appoint its appraiser within such period, the appraiser selected by the other
party shall alone serve as appraiser. Any appraiser acting as such hereunder
shall be a nationally recognized U.S. investment bank, firm of valuation
consultants or other reputable and experienced appraisers, in each case with
expertise in the appraisal of terminals and associated assets. The appraisers
shall determine in writing the fair market value of the Affected Assets
immediately prior to the Casualty Loss using standard valuation techniques as
such appraisers deem appropriate, but assuming that the Affected Assets were
used in connection with third-party, commercial terminal operations. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled to provide written materials to the
appraisers in connection with such appraisal, and each of Seller and Purchaser
shall provide all materials reasonably requested by the other party in
connection therewith. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall provide each
appraiser with the same written materials, if any, it provides the other
appraiser in assisting in the determination of the fair market value of the
Affected Assets immediately prior to the Casualty Loss. Each party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any appraiser engaged by such
party in accordance with this _Section 6.12_ to return its appraisal of the
fair market value of the Affected Assets immediately prior to the Casualty
Loss within thirty (30) days after the date of such appraiserÂ’s engagement by
such party.

 



 

(ii) If the higher of the appraisals exceeds the lower of the appraisals by
ten percent (10%) or less, then the fair market value of the Affected Assets
immediately prior to the Casualty Loss shall be equal to the average of the
two appraisals. If the higher of the appraisals exceeds the lower of the
appraisals by more than ten percent (10%), then the two appraisers shall
select a third appraiser who shall meet the aforementioned criteria for
appraisers. The third appraiser shall appraise the fair market value of the
Affected Assets immediately prior to the Casualty Loss within thirty (30) days
after the date of its engagement. If the amount of the third appraisal is
between the other two appraisals or is equal to either of the other two
appraisals, then the fair market value shall be deemed equal to the third
appraisal. If the third appraisal is higher than the other two appraisals,
then the fair market value shall be deemed equal to the higher of

 



      
 

 



 

the other two appraisals. If the third appraisal is lower than the other two
appraisals, then the fair arket value shall be deemed equal to the lower of
the other two appraisals. The fair market value of the Affected Assets as
determined pursuant to the appraisal process set forth in this Section 6.12(b)
(the " **Appraised Value** ") shall be final and shall be binding on each of
Seller and Purchaser. Each party shall bear the costs and expenses of its
appointed appraiser, and the costs and expenses of the third appraiser, if
any, shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Purchaser.

 



 

(iii) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the
Appraised Value, (i) if the Appraised Value is more than the Reduction Amount,
Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the Appraised Value minus the
Reduction Amount, or (ii) if the Appraised Value is less than the Reduction
Amount, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Reduction Amount
minus the Appraised Value, in either case, together with interest on such
amount from the Closing Date calculated using the prime rate of interest as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ as of the date prior to payment plus
two percent (2%).

 



 

6.13 _Insurance Matters_. (a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that coverage
of the Purchased Assets, tangible or intangible personal property,
Liabilities, ownership, activities, businesses, operations, officers,
employees and agents of the Terminal Operations (the " **Covered Assets and
Persons** ") under all insurance policies maintained by Seller and its
Subsidiaries (the " **Seller Corporate Policies** "), shall cease as of the
Closing Date and the Covered Assets and Persons will be deleted in all
respects as insureds (or additional insureds, as the case may be) under all
Seller Corporate Policies.

 



 

(b) If, after the Closing Date, Purchaser or Seller (or any of their
respective Affiliates) reasonably requires any information regarding claims
data or other information pertaining to a claim or an occurrence that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim (including any claims under the
Seller Corporate Policies relating to periods prior to the Closing) in order
to give notice to or make filings or claims with insurance carriers or claims
adjustors or administrators or to adjust, administer or otherwise manage a
claim, then Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall provide reasonable
assistance at the otherÂ’s sole cost and expense and shall cause such
information to be supplied to the other (or its designee), to the extent such
information is in its possession and control or can be reasonably obtained by
Seller or Purchaser (or their respective Affiliates), as applicable, promptly
upon a written request therefor. In furtherance of the foregoing, if any Third
Party requires the consent of Seller or any of its Affiliates to the
disclosure of claims data or information maintained by an insurance company or
other Third Party in respect of any claim (including any claims under any
Seller Corporate Policies relating to periods prior to the Closing), such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

6.14 _Bulk Sales Act_. (a) Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller with
respect to any applicable "bulk-sale", "bulk-transfer", or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transfer or sale to Purchaser of the
Purchased Assets.

 



 

(b) Purchaser agrees not to file the Notice of Sale, Transfer or Assignment in
Bulk provided for by New Jersey P.L. 2007, Chapter 100 (commonly referred to
as the Bulk Sales Act) in connection with this Agreement or the Purchase.

 



       
 

 



 

6.15 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 2.6_, at any time and from
time to time after the Closing Date, without further consideration, each party
hereto shall, at the reasonable request of the other party hereto, execute and
deliver such further instruments of conveyance, assignment, assumption and
transfer with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and
take such further action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to (a)
effectuate the intent of this Agreement, (b) perfect or record title of
Purchaser in the Purchased Assets, (c) put Purchaser in possession of the
Purchased Assets and (d) provide such other party in all material respects
with the intended benefits of this Agreement. If Purchaser receives any of the
Excluded Assets, Purchaser agrees to promptly return or cause the return to
Seller of, or allow Seller or its Representatives to remove and recover, such
assets at SellerÂ’s expense. In furtherance of the foregoing, with respect to
such Excluded Assets that Seller will remove and recover, Purchaser shall
grant to Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to PurchaserÂ’s
property from and after the Closing Date for a reasonable period of time not
to exceed one hundred-eighty (180) days to permit Seller and its
Representatives to remove and recover such Excluded Assets and make any other
appropriate arrangements with respect thereto. If Seller retains any of the
Purchased Assets, Seller agrees to promptly transfer or cause the transfer of
such assets to Purchaser.

 



 

6.16 _Seller Â’s Marks_. Following the Closing Date and except as otherwise
expressly permitted hereunder or in writing by Seller, neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates shall register, or attempt or seek to register, or use,
in any fashion, including in signage, corporate letterhead, business cards,
Internet web sites, marketing material or content and the like in connection
with any products or services anywhere in the world in any medium, any
trademark, service mark, trade dress, domain name, corporate name, trade name
or other indicia of origin that is confusingly similar to any of the
trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, corporate names, trade
names or other indicia of origin that are not Purchased Assets and are owned
or used as of the Closing Date by Seller or any of its Affiliates, including
those described in _Section 2.2(e)_ (collectively, " **Seller Â’s Marks**").
Except as otherwise expressly permitted in writing by Seller, Purchaser shall
ensure that, as soon as practical (but in no event more than thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date with respect to materials that publicly display
SellerÂ’s Marks or are otherwise distributed to the public (including
letterhead, advertising materials, marketing brochures and the like)), any
such materials bearing SellerÂ’s Marks are at SellerÂ’s election, returned to
Seller, destroyed or otherwise permanently altered to entirely remove SellerÂ’s
Marks. Furthermore, unless otherwise provided in the Transition Services
Agreement, Purchaser shall ensure that, as soon as practical (but in no event
more than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date) any hypertext links to
Internet web sites operated by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and any other
use of SellerÂ’s Marks are removed from any Internet web sites included in the
Purchased Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, unless otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement,
Purchaser shall ensure such removal on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day
after it become aware of such links or use. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 6.16_ shall preclude any references to the SellerÂ’s
Marks that are required by Law, that constitute "fair use" under applicable
Law, or that are in historical, tax, and similar records.

 



      
 

 



 

6.17 _Apportionments_. (a) _Utilities and Rents_. Seller and Purchaser hereby
agree that SellerÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ prepaid and/or accrued obligations
for utilities, rents and other obligations in respect of the Terminals and all
other items of prepaid and/or accrued income and expense in respect thereof
will be prorated as of the Closing on a per diem basis (i.e., on the
assumption that such obligations were uniformly incurred during the billing
period in which the Closing occurs).

 



 

(b) _Other Prepaid Expenses_. Seller and Purchaser hereby agree that, to the
extent not provided for in _Section 6.17(a)_, prepaid expenses, including
royalty payments, attributable to the Purchased Assets and payments due under
the Assumed Contracts shall be prorated based upon a reasonable estimate
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser.

 



 

(c) _Exclusion of Certain Apportionments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 6.17_, the apportionments provided for in
this _Section 6.17_ shall not apply to amounts otherwise taken into
consideration in calculating the Closing St. Lucia Working Capital.

 



 

6.18 _ISRA and CT Transfer Act_. (a) In respect of its indemnity obligations
under _Section 8.2(f)_ of this Agreement, and subject to the terms of this
_Section 6.18_, _Section 6.20_ and _Article VIII_, Seller shall undertake
all steps necessary to comply with the requirements of ISRA and the CT
Transfer Act imposed on account of the execution of, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Following the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate
with Seller in connection with SellerÂ’s ISRA and the CT Transfer Act
obligations, including by timely filing any required documents with the
appropriate Governmental Entities, providing access to and use of the subject
site, employees, documents and on-site structures, infrastructure and utility
services (including electricity, underground piping or wastewater or sewer
systems) and/or utilities as necessary to perform any required Remedial
Action, including access to install, maintain, replace and operate wells and
remove impacted soil and/or groundwater; _provided_ , that Seller shall
promptly reimburse Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all out-
of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with such cooperation,
access and services.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have sole and exclusive control of the development,
negotiation, implementation and management of any Remedial Action under ISRA
or the CT Transfer Act, as the case may be, and to the extent a Remedial
Action is required to comply with ISRA or the CT Transfer Act, Seller shall
conduct such Remedial Action in the Most Cost-Effective Manner.

 



 

(c) If Purchaser directly or indirectly transfers all or any portion of the
Purchased Assets subject to ISRA or the CT Transfer Act to any other Person
prior to the applicable Remediation Completion Date, Purchaser shall require
such other Person to (i) grant to Seller the same rights set forth in this
_Section 6.18_ and (ii) further require any future transferee of any portion
of the Terminal Operations to grant to Seller the same rights set forth in
this _Section 6.18_.

 



 

6.19 _Port Reading Decommissioning_. Seller shall, at SellerÂ’s cost and
expense, perform above surface demolition to grade and decommissioning at the
Port Reading Refinery

 



      
 

 



 

and the wastewater treatment plant at the Port Reading Terminal as described
in the Port Reading Demolition Access Easement, which demolition and
decommissioning activities shall include cleaning of all subsurface sewer
systems, subgrade sumps, and other underground equipment within the
Decommissioning Area (as defined in the Port Reading Demolition Access
Easement) that are not removed but no other subsurface work (the " **Port
Reading Decommissioning** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall have
no responsibilities in connection with the Port Reading Decommissioning unless
Purchaser complies with its obligations set forth in the Port Reading
Demolition Access Easement, which shall be recorded against legal title to the
Port Reading Terminal immediately following recordation of the deed for the
Port Reading Terminal. Seller shall have sole and exclusive control of the
development, negotiation, implementation and management of the Port Reading
Decommissioning. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate with Seller in connection with the development,
negotiation, implementation and management of the Port Reading
Decommissioning. To the extent allowed under any Environmental Law, Seller
shall execute, record, obtain and maintain in good standing any authorization,
permit or "generator number" as may be necessary for the proper storage,
transportation and/or off-site disposal of any Hazardous Material generated in
the course of the Port Reading Decommissioning; _provided_ , _however_ , to
the extent Purchaser is required under Environmental Law to do any of the
foregoing, then Purchaser shall do so. Seller shall undertake the Port Reading
Decommissioning in the Most Cost-Effective Manner. The Port Reading
Decommissioning and all of SellerÂ’s obligations related thereto shall be
deemed satisfied, completed and fully discharged upon the date that an
independent engineering consultant retained by Seller determines in good faith
that the Port Reading Decommissioning has been completed.

 



 

6.20 _Access Easements_. In respect of its indemnity obligations under
_Sections 8.2(f)_ and _8.2(g)_ of this Agreement, Seller shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to conduct and control any Remedial Action
concerning any Known Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities and any Unknown
Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, and an Access Easement with respect to
each Terminal shall be recorded against legal title to such Terminal
immediately following recordation of the deed with respect to the transfer of
such Terminal to allow for the same. If Seller opts or is required to conduct
a Remedial Action at any Terminal to satisfy its indemnification obligations
under this Agreement, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
do so without unreasonably interfering with PurchaserÂ’s operations, and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate with
Seller, including by timely filing any required documents with the appropriate
Governmental Entities, providing access to and use of the subject site,
employees, documents and on-site structures, infrastructure and utility
services (including electricity, underground piping or wastewater or sewer
systems) and/or utilities as necessary to perform any required Remedial
Action, including access to install, maintain, replace and operate wells and
remove impacted soil and/or groundwater pursuant to an Access Easement and by
otherwise complying with the Access Easement; _provided_ , that Seller shall
promptly reimburse Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all out-
of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with such cooperation,
access and services. To the extent allowed under any Environmental Law, Seller
shall execute, record, obtain and maintain in good standing any authorization,
permit or "generator number" as may be necessary for the proper storage,
transportation and/or off-site disposal of any Hazardous Material generated in
the course of the Remedial Action; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent
Purchaser is required under Environmental Law to do any of the foregoing, then
Purchaser shall do so. Purchaser shall sign or cause to be

 



      
 

 



 

signed and record or caused to be recorded any deed or other recordable real
property instrument reasonably requested by Seller and reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser in form and content which is necessary to permit the use of site
specific corrective action remedies or remedies based on exposure controls as
part of such Remedial Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the instrument
does not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Terminal as
conducted as of the Closing Date or preclude the construction of future
improvements at the Terminal without PurchaserÂ’s written approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser agrees not to use the groundwater
under any Terminal if such restriction is necessary to permit the use of site
specific corrective action remedies or remedies based on exposure controls as
part of such Remedial Action.

 



 

6.21 _Tank Bottoms_. (a) Commencing on the Closing Date, the volume and
quality of East Coast Tank Bottoms and Retained St. Lucia Tank Bottoms (the "
**Tank Bottom Inventory Count** ") shall be assessed by an independent
inspector (the " **Field Inspector** ") appointed by Seller and Purchaser and
mutually acceptable to both parties. The Tank Bottom Inventory Count shall be
conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Exhibit B_,
including the gauging, temperature determination, sampling, and testing of all
tanks at the Terminals which are not included in the Purchased St. Lucia
Hydrocarbon Inventory Count. Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled, at their
respective own expense, to have Representatives present for the Tank Bottom
Inventory Count so long as such Representatives do not interfere with the
tasks or responsibilities of the Field Inspector. The parties shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Field Inspector to
issue a written report (the " **Tank Bottom Inventory Report** ") to both
Seller and Purchaser within five (5) days after the Closing Date setting forth
the Field InspectorÂ’s final determination of the volume and quality of East
Coast Tank Bottoms and Retained St. Lucia Tank Bottoms as of the Closing Date.
The fees and expenses of the Field Inspector shall be borne by Seller.
Ownership of the East Coast Tank Bottoms and Retained St. Lucia Tank Bottoms
shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Exhibit
I_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
between the date of this Agreement and the date that is one hundred eighty
(180) days following the Closing Date (the " **Removal Period** "), Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to remove from the Terminals the portion of
the East Coast Tank Bottoms and Retained St. Lucia Tank Bottoms that are owned
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as determined in accordance with _Exhibit
I_. Following Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
afford Seller, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives reasonable
cooperation and access to the Terminals to the extent necessary for Seller and
its Subsidiaries to comply with the foregoing sentence; _provided_ , that such
access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of Purchaser and its
Affiliates. For purposes of this _Section 6.21(b)_, following Closing,
Retained St. Lucia Tank Bottoms that are owned by any Conveyed Entity as
determined in accordance with _Exhibit I_ shall be deemed to be owned by
Seller, and Seller may remove such Retained St. Lucia Tank Bottoms in
accordance with this _Section 6.21(b)_. To the extent that, at any time
following the Closing, any East Coast Tank Bottoms or Retained St. Lucia Tank
Bottoms (other than any East Coast Tank Bottoms or Retained St. Lucia Tank
Bottoms contained in Available Tanks) have not been removed from the
applicable Terminals by Seller and its Subsidiaries in accordance with this
_Section 6.21(b)_, such East Coast Tank Bottoms and Retained St. Lucia Tank
Bottoms shall be treated in the manner set forth in _Exhibit I_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the Removal Period, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall remove and
dispose of that portion of the Available Tank Substances in each Available
Tank (including cleaning the Available Tanks if necessary) such that the
volume and quality of remaining Available Tank Substances in such Available
Tank (i) do not negatively impact PurchaserÂ’s ability to lease such Available
Tank consistent with industry standard practices immediately following such
removal, (ii) do not negatively impact the quality of products to be stored in
such Available Tank immediately following such removal; _provided_ , that such
products are compatible with products stored in such Available Tank prior to
Closing, and (iii) do not violate any applicable Law in effect at the time of
Closing. Following Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, afford Seller, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives reasonable
cooperation and access to the Terminals to the extent necessary for Seller and
its Subsidiaries to comply with the foregoing sentence; _provided_ , that such
access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of Purchaser and its
Affiliates. To the extent that any Available Tank Substances required to be
removed by Seller and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.21(c)_
have not been removed by Seller and its Subsidiaries in accordance with this
_Section 6.21(c)_ at or prior to the end of the Removal Period, Purchaser may
remove and dispose of such Available Tank Substances (including cleaning the
Available Tanks if necessary) required to be removed by Seller and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.21(c)_ at PurchaserÂ’s cost and
expense. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for such cost and expense plus a
project management fee equal to twelve percent (12%) of such cost and expense,
payable by Seller to Purchaser in immediately available funds within fifteen
(15) days of SellerÂ’s receipt of PurchaserÂ’s invoice.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, upon reasonable prior
notice and during regular business hours, afford Seller and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives reasonable access to the personnel,
properties, books and records of Purchaser and its Affiliates relating to the
East Coast Tank Bottoms, St. Lucia Tank Bottoms and Available Tank Substances
contemplated to be removed pursuant to this _Section 6.21_, and Purchaser
shall furnish to Seller all information concerning the same as Seller may
reasonably request; _provided_ , that Purchaser may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, any
applicable Law requires it to restrict such access; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates.

 



 

6.22 _Reimbursable Costs and Expenses_ Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, upon reasonable prior notice and during regular business hours,
afford Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books and records of Purchaser
and its Affiliates relating to all Reimbursable Costs and Expenses, and
Purchaser shall furnish to Seller all information concerning Reimbursable
Costs and Expenses as Seller may reasonably request; _provided_ , that
Purchaser may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser, any applicable Law requires it to restrict
such access; and provided, further, that such access shall not unreasonably
disrupt the operations of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the provisions of Article VIII shall govern indemnification
subject to Article VIII.

 



      
 

 



 

6.23 _Certain Actions Prior to Closing_

6.24 _Financial Information_. From and after the date hereof until the earlier
of (i) the date that the Acquisition Financials are filed with the SEC and
(ii) the date that the SEC notifies Purchaser, or Purchaser notifies Seller,
that no such Acquisition Financials are required, Seller agrees, at
PurchaserÂ’s sole cost and expense, (a) to provide to Purchaser available
annual and unaudited interim financial statements related to the ownership and
operation of the Terminals, if any, that Purchaser and its advisors reasonably
determine are required to enable Purchaser to comply with Rule 3-05 and
Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. federal securities laws related to
financial statements of, and pro forma financial information reflecting, an
acquired business (the " **Acquisition Financials** "), and (b) if necessary,
to cooperate with the preparation of such Acquisition Financials by Purchaser,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to provide any representations required by the independent
auditors of such Acquisition Financials; _provided_ , that this _Section
6.24_ shall not require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action
that would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business of Seller and its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek, as promptly as possible, confirmation from the SEC that Purchaser is not
required to prepare and file the Acquisition Financials, (ii) inform Seller of
any written communication (or material verbal communication) made to or
received by the SEC and, if practicable, permit Seller the opportunity to
review and comment on any such written communication to the SEC (and give
reasonable consideration to SellerÂ’s comments) and (iii) keep Seller informed,
on a prompt basis of any material developments with respect to such requested
relief. Purchaser acknowledges that in furtherance of this _Section 6.24_
Seller will promptly begin its work and will retain the services of its
outside auditors. In no event shall Seller be in breach of this _Section
6.24_ because of the failure to deliver any auditor comfort letters or consent
with respect to any financial or other information by its accountants or other
advisors. In no event shall Seller or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
incur any Liability (including due to any act or omission by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives) or unreimbursed
expense in connection with complying with this _Section 6.24_ or as a result
of any information provided by Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives in connection therewith. Purchaser shall,

incurred by Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection with their compliance
with this _Section 6.24_, including the costs and expenses of accountants and
counsel. Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for any and all
Losses that may be incurred by them as a result of SellerÂ’s performance of the

amount of Qualifying Losses which may be recovered from Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, pursuant to such provisions of this Agreement equals or
exceeds the Deductible, in which case Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser,
on the other hand, as the case may be, shall be liable only for the aggregate
amount of Qualifying Losses in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , that the
Qualifying Loss and Deductible limitations shall not apply to claims for

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
Seller shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2(g)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses which may be

Date shall survive until finally and fully resolved.

 



 

8.5 _Losses Net of Insurance, etc._ (a) The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ shall be net

indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any Person (other than
this Agreement), (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of any costs of
investigation of the underlying claim and of collection) received as an offset
against such Loss (each source of recovery referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii), a " **Collateral Source** ") and (iii) an amount equal to the tax
benefit to the Indemnified Party and its Subsidiaries or a beneficial owner of
the foregoing, if any, attributable to such Loss. If the amount to be netted
hereunder in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with a Collateral Source from any payment required under _Section 8.2_ or
_Section 8.3_ is received after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any
amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after such receipt, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not
have had to pay pursuant to this _Article VIII_ had such receipt occurred at
the time of such payment. Each Indemnified Party shall take commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses as soon as reasonably practicable
after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any event which does, or could
reasonably be expected to, give rise to any such Losses (including by pursuing
recovery from any Collateral Source).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided under _Section 8.2(f)_ for
Known Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities, _Section 8.2(g)_ for Unknown Pre-
Closing Environmental Liabilities, or _Section 8.2(h)_ for Reopener Remedial
Action Liabilities shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) With respect to any Remedial Action, whether conducted by Seller or
Purchaser, Seller shall only be liable to the extent such Remedial Action is
conducted in the Most Cost-Effective Manner. Regardless of whether Seller or
Purchaser conducts any such Remedial Action, Purchaser shall be responsible
for any operation and maintenance with respect to any such institutional or
engineering controls subsequent to completion of their initial installation,
and such post-installation costs shall not be subject to indemnification
and/or reimbursement claims against Seller.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall not be responsible for Losses to the extent they are caused,
triggered, increased or have their timing accelerated by (u) any act or
omission of, or any delay caused by, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, (v) any changes in Environmental Law coming into effect after
the Closing, (w) any change in use classification of any Terminal (as
industrial, commercial or residential) after the Closing, (x) a disclosure
made as a result of a voluntary audit, inspection, analysis, sampling or the
like after the Closing by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives of any information concerning any environmental matters,
(y) any decommissioning, closure or shutdown of a facility or a unit,
including a waste management unit, in each case undertaken by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates or Representatives or (z) any sampling and analysis of any
environmental media conducted after the Closing by or on behalf of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, unless such sampling and analysis
is (1) required by Environmental Law or by a Governmental Entity, (2) required
to be conducted in response to a Third-Party Claim alleging that Hazardous
Materials have migrated offsite from a Terminal, (3) independently required by
a lender as a condition to providing financing to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates as part of the lenderÂ’s normal business practices, or (4)
undertaken in the ordinary course of business of Purchaser, such as
construction, remodelling or demolition work at a Terminal, including any
geophysical studies undertaken in connection with such work (it being
understood that Seller shall only be responsible for Losses associated with
long-term remediation of any undisturbed, newly discovered Hazardous
Materials, while Purchaser shall be responsible for Losses associated with the
handling, disposal, or processing of any Hazardous Materials that are
disturbed in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with such construction, remodelling or demolition) or (5) conducted
as a result of and reasonably necessary to respond to a Release that occurs
after the Closing Date.

 



 

(iii) Except with respect to Reopener Remedial Action Liabilities, SellerÂ’s
indemnity obligations with respect to any particular Known Pre-Closing
Environmental Liability or any Unknown Pre-Closing Environmental Liability
shall be deemed satisfied, completed and fully discharged upon the relevant
Remediation Completion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the Remediation
Completion Date and except for Reopener Remedial Action Liabilities, Purchaser
shall assume responsibility for all ongoing obligations with respect to such
matter, including operation and maintenance of any institutional and
engineering controls, long-term groundwater monitoring and reporting,
obtaining and maintaining all Permits required under Environmental Laws, and
establishing and maintaining any financial assurances.

 



 

8.6 _Indemnification Procedure_. (a) Promptly after any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ , including any
claim by a Person described in _Section 8.7_ (an " **Indemnified Party** ")
becomes aware of the existence or assertion of any claim (including a Third
Party Claim) or has incurred losses which might give rise to indemnification
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the party from which
indemnification is sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") a certificate (a "
**Claim Certificate** "), which Claim Certificate shall:

 



 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has become aware of a claim or has paid
or incurred Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) specify, to the extent applicable, (and have annexed thereto all
supporting documentation, including any correspondence in connection with any
Third-Party Claim and paid invoices, if any, for claimed Losses) each
individual item of Loss included in the amount, if any, so stated, the date
such item was paid or incurred and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item or the Claim
Certificate is related and the computation, if determinable, of the amount to
which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

 



 

(b) Following the incurrence of any quantifiable Losses in respect of any
claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in a
subsequent Claim Certificate of the amount of any such Losses and shall
include supporting documentation for each item included therein.

 



 

(c) The Indemnified Party making the claim shall not be required to admit or
deny the validity of the facts or circumstances out of which such Losses
arose.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall object to the indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or any Losses specified in any Claim
Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate, deliver to the
Indemnified Party a notice to such effect, specifying in

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty (60) day period beginning on the
date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such objection, attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to the
claim or each of such Losses to which the Indemnifying Party shall have so
objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in
reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to the claim or any
of such Losses, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to
indemnification for any claim or any particular item or items or amount or
amounts within such time period, then the Indemnified Party shall be permitted
to submit such dispute to the courts set forth in _Section 10.8_.

 



 

(e) Claims specified in any Claim Certificate to which an Indemnifying Party
shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of such Claim
Certificate, claims covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature
described in _Section 8.6(c)_ , and claims the validity and amount of which
have been the subject of judicial determination or shall have been settled
with the consent of the Indemnified Party, as described in _Section 8.7(d)_ ,
are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " **Agreed Claims** ". Within
ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to
the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank
account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the
Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such payment.

 



 

8.7 _Third-Party Claims_. (a) If a claim by a Third Party (a " **Third-Party
Claim** ") is made against any Indemnified Party, and if such party intends to
seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _Section 8.7_ , such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third-
Party Claim by delivery of a Claim Certificate; _provided_ , that the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the Claim Certificate is not delivered to
the Indemnifying Party within the relevant survival period set forth in
_Section 8.1_ or the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice to assume the conduct and control, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, through counsel of its choosing, of the settlement or
defense of such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with it in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the control of such defense and shall pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if such Third
Party Claim would reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses which are more
than twice the amount indemnifiable by such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Seller shall have the right to
control any Third-Party Claim which relates solely to Taxes (x) attributable
to the Purchased Assets or the Terminal Operations with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period or (y) imposed on Seller and (ii) Purchaser shall not consent
to any settlement or compromise of any Third-Party Claim that (x) adversely
affects or may adversely affect the Tax Liability of Seller or any of its
Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Period or (y) would require payment by Seller
of any amount under _Section 8.2_ , in each case without the written consent
of Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim in accordance with _Section 8.7(a)_ or the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim as set forth in
_Section 8.7(c)_ , (ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (iii) the named parties to
any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised in writing by such counsel that there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such Third-Party Claim only as to itself; _provided_ , that
in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the
Indemnifying Party for such Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party
shall have consented to such payment or settlement.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s Claim
Certificate seeking indemnification with respect to a Third-Party Claim that
it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to contest, settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that is not entirely
indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or
Persons asserting such Third-Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties of an
unconditional release from all Liability with respect to such Third-Party
Claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including making available records relating to such Third-
Party Claim and furnishing, without expense to the Indemnifying Party and/or
its counsel, such employees of the Indemnified Party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such Third-Party Claim or
for testimony as witnesses in any proceeding relating to such Third-Party
Claim.

 



 

8.8 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
if the Closing occurs, except in the case of actual fraud, the remedies
provided for in this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
for any breach of this Agreement or any claims relating to this Agreement,
other documents, certificates or agreements delivered in connection with this
Agreement, the Terminal Operations, the Assumed Liabilities, the Purchased
Assets, and the Excluded Liabilities (including with respect to Pre-Closing
Asbestos Liabilities).

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and exclusive remedy against Seller
or any Affiliate of Seller for any Losses relating to any Environmental Laws,
Permits required under Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials, or any
environmental, health or

 



      
 

 



 

safety matter, including natural resources (" **Environmental Losses** "), is
under _Section 8.2_ of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, from
and after the Closing, except for any Losses for which Seller is obligated to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.2_ , (i) Purchaser
hereby releases, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
predecessors, successors and assigns, officers, directors, employees, agents
and partners, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each
Seller Indemnitee from (x) any Environmental Losses incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnitees and (y) any other environmental, health or safety matter,
including natural resources, related in any way to the Terminal Operations or
this Agreement or its subject matter, (ii) Purchaser hereby waives, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns,
officers, directors, employees, agents and partners, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any claim or remedy against the Seller
Indemnitees now or hereafter available under any applicable Environmental Law,
including CERCLA or similar international, foreign, federal, regional or state
Law, whether or not in existence on the date hereof and (iii) Purchaser shall
fully indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any
Environmental Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnitees and any other
environmental, health or safety matter, including natural resources, in each
case related in any way to the Terminal Operations or this Agreement or its
subject matter. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties agree that, upon
Closing, an environmental release in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit M_
(the " **Environmental Release** ") shall become effective and shall be
recorded immediately following recordation of the deeds with respect to the
transfer of each parcel of Owned Real Property. The obligations of Purchaser
under this _Section 8.8(b)_ shall be binding upon the successors and assigns
of Purchaser. If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or any
portion of the Purchased Assets to any other Person (whether by asset sale,
stock sale or otherwise), proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Purchaser honor the obligations set forth in this
_Section 8.8(b)_.

 



 

8.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payment made pursuant to the
indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



 

8.10 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and its equityholders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Representatives,
direct and indirect parent companies, managers, officers and directors, and
each of their respective successors and assigns (each a " **Releasor** "),
hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, Seller and its past, present and future equityholders,
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Representatives, direct and indirect parent
companies, managers, officers and directors (each, a " **Releasee** ") of,
from and against any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands,
damages, judgments, Liabilities, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature
and description whatsoever, arising out of SellerÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’
ownership and operation of the Terminal Operations, which such Releasor ever
had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever on or prior to the Closing Date. Each Releasor agrees not to, and
agrees to cause its respective equityholders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives, and each of their respective successors and assigns, not to,
assert any claim against the Releasees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Releasor releases its rights, interests and claims under this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement.

condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction that would otherwise cause such conditions not
to be satisfied, other than a failure of the condition set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_ resulting from any actual, knowing, and intentional breach of any
covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section _9.1(b)(ii)_ if such party

Agreement that, in either case, (x) would result in the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) which is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured upon the occurrence of the earlier of (1) the
thirtieth (30th) day after written notice thereof is given by Purchaser to
Seller and (2) the day that is five (5) Business Days prior to the End Date;
_provided_ , that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

pursuant to _Section 9.1_ by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the
other hand, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall be terminated and become void and have no effect and

damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the

thereof or of any other right.

10.8 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE

OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES
THEREOF. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN NEW YORK COUNTY IN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES
BETWEEN THE

 



      
 

 



 

PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THE PARTIES CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO
ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY CLAIM THAT (A) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF
SUCH COURTS, (B) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYÂ’S PROPERTY IS IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL

10.10 _Specific Enforcement; Limitation on Damages_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would
be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties
shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages,
including an Order for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each party
further agrees that neither the other party nor any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 10.10_ , and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument. Each party further agrees that the only permitted
objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is
that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

10.11 _Florida Law Disclosures_.

 



 

(a) _Radon_. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it has
accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks
to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed
federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida.
Additional information regarding radon and radon testing may be obtained from
your county public health unit.

 



 

(b) _Energy-Efficiency Rating Information_. Purchaser hereby acknowledges
receipt of the information brochure required by Section 553.996, Florida
Statutes.

 



 

(c) _Coastal Construction Control Line_. If all or part of any transferred
real property is located seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line as
defined in Section 161.053, Florida Statutes (the " **CCCL** "), Florida Law
requires the seller thereof to provide the buyer thereof with an affidavit, or
a survey meeting the requirements of Chapter 472 of the Florida Statutes,
delineating the location of the CCCL on the subject real property at or prior
to the closing of the transfer of such real property, unless the purchaser
thereof waives such requirement in writing. In the event that the foregoing
sentence is applicable to the transfer and sale of any real property
transferred hereunder, Purchaser hereby waives the right to receive a CCCL
affidavit or survey.

 



 

10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND SHALL CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES TO WAIVE,
ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

10.13 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document.
