Partnership, Parent or MergerCo, or any other party with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Surviving Partnership or the Closing Exchange Agent reasonably believes is
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such

_Withholding Tax_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Partnership
and/or the Closing Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall not be entitled
to withhold any amounts pursuant to this Section 3.3(e) if the Surviving
Partnership or the Closing Exchange Agent, as the case may be, has received,
prior to Closing, such certificates or forms as are sufficient, under the Code
and applicable Treasury Regulations, to establish that withholding is not
required. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Partnership or the Closing
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient of such amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Partnership or the Closing Exchange
Agent.

reasonable detail of each such adjustment and the facts and circumstances
supporting such adjustments. The Titan Representative shall have thirty (30)
days following delivery of the Closing Date Purchase Price Certificate to
review any adjustments to the amounts set forth in the Estimated Purchase
Price Certificate, and if, in the Titan Representatives opinion, the Closing
Date Purchase Price Certificate, and any other adjustments to the amounts set
forth in the Estimated Purchase Price Certificate were not prepared
in accordance with the definitions thereof or were otherwise calculated in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, then the Titan
Representative shall, within such 30-day period, deliver to the Surviving
Partnership written proposed adjustments to the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
and any  



 

\- 21 -  other adjustments to the amounts set forth in the Closing Date Purchase
Price Certificate (the " _Seller s Adjustment Request_") setting forth in
reasonable detail (A) the amount of the proposed adjustment, (B) the item or
items to which such proposed adjustment relates, and (C) the facts and
circumstances supporting such adjustment. During such 30-day period

request for purposes of evaluating the Surviving Partnerships calculation of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, any other adjustments to the amounts set forth
in the Estimated Purchase Price Certificate, and in no event shall the
Sellers Adjustment Request be required to be delivered to the Surviving
Partnership until fifteen (15) days after all information and access
reasonably requested by the Titan Representative has been provided to it. The
Titan Representative and the Surviving Partnership shall use their respective
good faith efforts for ten (10) days after delivery of the Sellers Adjustment
Request to agree upon any adjustments to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
any other adjustments to the amounts set forth in the Closing Date Purchase
Price Certificate proposed in the Sellers Adjustment Request. At any time
after the expiration of such 10-day period, either the Titan Representative or
the Surviving Partnership may demand in writing that any or all disputes
reflected in the Sellers Adjustment Request and not previously resolved
between the Titan Representative and the Surviving Partnership be submitted
for resolution to a firm of independent nationally recognized
accountants (the " _Independent Accountant_ "), which firm shall be
reasonably acceptable to both parties. In the event the Titan Representative
and the Surviving Partnership fail to agree on the selection of the
Independent Accountant within five (5) days after the demand, each shall,
within five (5) days, select a certified public accounting firm of national
standing, and the two accounting firms so selected shall, within ten (10) days
after selection, designate a third firm as the Independent Accountant. As
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after
selection or designation of the Independent Accountant, the Titan
Representative and the Surviving Partnership shall each deliver to the
Independent Accountant written submissions supporting their respective
positions with respect to such dispute. The Independent Accountant shall
render a decision with respect to each disputed amount regarding the Closing
Date Purchase Price Certificate, and the Sellers Adjustment Request (the "
_Independent Accountant s Determination_"), within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the written submissions, and such decision and any dispute relating
thereto, shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced
as an arbitration award in any court of competent jurisdiction; _provided_ ,

submissions of the Titan Representative and the Surviving Partnership, shall

shall be within the range of the amounts in dispute as calculated by each of
the parties.

connection with this Section 3.4 shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand,
and the Partnership, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as the
Surviving Partnership (on behalf of Parent) and the Titan Representative (on
behalf of the Partnership) may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent
Accountant, and such proportionate allocation also shall be determined by the
Independent Accountant when the Independent Accountants Determination is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The sole and exclusive source
for satisfaction of the Partnerships obligations under this Section 3.4
shall be the Escrow.

or from any Governmental Authorities or other Persons, including parties to
loan agreements or other debt instruments, in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein and (ii) in promptly making any such
filings, in furnishing information required in connection therewith and in
timely seeking to obtain any such consents, approvals, permits or

which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except neither party shall be under any obligation to disclose
or deliver to the other party any materials that constitute so-called "4(c)
documents" under the HSR Act. In exercising the foregoing right, each of

promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any

believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that such consent or approval

materially delayed.

a meeting of the limited partners of the Partnership to be held no later than
May 15, 2006 for the purpose of seeking the Partnership Approval. The General
Partner shall recommend to the limited partners of the Partnership that they
approve the Merger (the " _General Partner Recommendation_ "), except to the
extent that the General Partner shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified
the General Partner Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.5(b). The
General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such
other actions, including the solicitation of proxies for such meeting,
necessary or desirable to obtain the Partnership Approval.

Section 6.5 No Solicitation by the Partnership.

(a) Neither the Partnership nor the General Partner shall, nor shall they
authorize any of their managers, officers or employees or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative retained by it (each, a " _Partnership Representative_ "),
directly or indirectly through another Person to (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public
information with respect to the Partnership or otherwise knowingly cooperate
in any way in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. The General Partner
and the Partnership shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt  



 

\- 47 -  return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
The General Partner and the Partnership agree that they will promptly inform
the Partnership Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.5(a). If this Agreement has not been publicly filed with the SEC by Parent
and the General Partner receives any unsolicited inquiry that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal,
then the General Partner and the Partnership may provide the Person making
such inquiry or proposal with a copy of this Section 6.5. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the Partnership obtaining the Partnership
Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that the
General Partner determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) constitutes or is reasonably likely to be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date
hereof and was not solicited in breach of, or did not otherwise result from a
breach of, this Section 6.5(a), (I) the General Partner and the Partnership
may contact the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its advisors for
the sole purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal, including, without
limitation, its terms and feasibility, and (II) if the General
Partner determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to respond to such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the partners of the
Partnership under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with Section
6.5(c) and after giving Parent written notice of such determination, the
Partnership may (x) furnish information with respect to the Partnership to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than
the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) The General Partner shall not (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent), the General Partner Recommendation or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to any unaffiliated limited partner of the Partnership to
approve or recommend, or allow the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any definitive agreement constituting or related to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to the Partnership obtaining the Partnership
Approval, the General Partner may make a Partnership Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Superior Proposal if the General Partner determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the partners of the Partnership under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in
response to a Superior Proposal until after the third (3rd) business day
following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse
Recommendation_ ") from the Partnership advising Parent that the General
Partner intends to make such a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change and
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.
In determining whether to make a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the General Partner shall take into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent (i) in response
to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise during  



 

\- 48 -  the three (3) business day period following receipt of such Notice of
Adverse Recommendation, or (ii) in the event of any amendment or
other modification of any financial or other material term of such Superior
Proposal (whether in response to any change to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to an initial Notice of Adverse Recommendation
or otherwise), the Partnership shall provide to Parent a new Notice of
Adverse Recommendation, and the General Partner shall take into account any
change to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
new Notice of Adverse Recommendation during the 24-hour period following
receipt of such new Notice of Adverse Recommendation; _provided_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent have less than three
(3) business days following the receipt of the initial Notice of Adverse
Recommendation to respond to the applicable Superior Proposal if the terms of
such Superior Proposal are modified prior to the expiration of the initial
three (3) business day period during which Parent is entitled to respond.
After providing the Notice of Adverse Recommendation, the Partnership shall
provide a reasonable opportunity to Parent to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the General Partner to
proceed with the General Partner Recommendation.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section 6.5, the Partnership shall promptly (but in no
event later than two (2) days after the receipt thereof) advise Parent orally
and in writing of any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal with respect to which
it wishes to take an action contemplated in Section 6.5(a)(II) and the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any
material changes thereto and any changes to the material financial terms
therein) and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal.
The Partnership shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
details (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any such
Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (x) permit the Partnership to terminate
this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article IX hereof) or (y)
affect any other obligation of Parent or the Partnership under this Agreement.

Section 6.6 Officers and Directors Indemnification.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the General Partner, the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he or she is or was a trustee, director, officer, employee,
or agent of the General Partner, the Partnership or the Partnership
Subsidiaries, or any Employee Benefit Plan of the Partnership or Partnership
Subsidiaries, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered
in connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
thereby whether in any case asserted or arising at or before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and
agreed that the Surviving  



 

\- 49 -  Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Partnership (together with the Partnership, the "
_Indemnitors_ "), shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation (collectively, " _Indemnifiable
Amounts_ "), and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time), (A) the Indemnitors, shall promptly (but in any event
within ten (10) calendar days of written request) pay expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law; (B) the Indemnitors shall have the right
to defend each Indemnified Party in any proceeding which may give rise to the
payment of Indemnifiable Amounts hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitors shall notify such Indemnified Party of any such decision to
defend within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of notice of any such
proceeding, and, _provided_ _further_ , that the Indemnitors shall not,
without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party, consent to the
entry of any judgment against such Indemnified Party or enter into any
settlement or compromise which (I) includes an admission of fault of such
Indemnified Party or (II) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof,
the full release of such Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of
such proceeding, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party and (C) notwithstanding clause (B)
above, if in a proceeding to which an Indemnified Party is a party by reason
of the Indemnified Partys service as a director, officer, employee, or agent
of the General Partner, the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary, (I)
such Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that he or she may have separate
defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be
consistent with the position of other defendants in such proceeding, (II) a
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitors, or (III) if the Indemnitors fail to
assume the defense of such proceeding in a timely manner, such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of such
Indemnified Partys choice at the expense of the Indemnitors; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of the Indemnitors shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided_ _further_ ,
that the Indemnitors shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable,
that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6, upon learning
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Partnership and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Partnership thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Partnership and the Surviving
Partnership except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly notify
materially and adversely prejudices such party.

(b) Parent and MergerCo each agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director and officer of General Partner,
the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries provided for in the
respective organizational documents or otherwise in effect as of the date
hereof shall  



 

\- 50 -  survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time; ( _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a " _Claim_ ") asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Claim) and that Parent and MergerCo assume and will honor such obligations.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership shall, at its expense,
purchase a non-cancelable extended reporting period endorsement with respect
to the Partnerships existing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage for the Partnerships directors and officers (the " _D andO Policy_") (
_provided_ that the Partnership shall have the option to select a different
carrier to write such endorsement if such carrier has an A.M. Best rating at
least as favorable as the Partnerships current carrier or is otherwise
reasonably acceptable to Parent), which shall provide such directors and
officers and the Surviving Partnership with coverage for six (6) years
following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage (and not
more than $20,000,000) under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage
presently maintained by the Partnership. The Surviving Partnership shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor all
obligations thereunder.

(d) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section
6.6 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.6 applies shall
be express third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6 and shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Partnership or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.6.

Section 6.7 Notices of Certain Events. 

(a) The General Partner and the Partnership shall notify Parent of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger; and

(ii) any actions commenced or, to its Knowledge threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiary which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.12 or which relate to
the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Parent and MergerCo shall notify the General Partner and the Partnership
of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in

Surviving Partnership to, honor in accordance with their terms the employment
and compensation plans and agreements which are listed in _Section 6.8(a)_ of
the Disclosure Letter. Subject to such employment and compensation plans and
agreements, the Surviving Partnership will provide to the employees of the
Partnership and Partnership Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time, employment on such terms and with such employee benefits substantially
equivalent to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent;
provided, however, all employees of the Surviving Partnership will be
"employees at will," and this provision will not constitute an on-going
guarantee of employment to any Current Employee; 

(b) Each full time employee of the Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries
who becomes a full-time employee of the Surviving Partnership will: (i) be
entitled to participate in each "welfare plan" of the Parent in accordance
with its terms to the extent such employee was covered under a similar
Employee Plan; (ii) be entitled to participate in the Parents 401(k) plan in
accordance with its terms; (iii) be entitled to participate in the plans of

General Partner for the tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date
("Titan Tax Returns") and (ii) prepare and provide Forms K-1 to the former
holders of partnership interests in the Partnership and membership interests
in the General Partner. The Titan Representative shall have the right to
control (at its own expense) all matters in connection with any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to any Titan Tax Return;
_provided_ , that the Titan Representative shall not take a position in the
Titan Tax Returns or in any audit, litigation or other proceeding related
thereto which Parent, in its reasonable judgment after consultation with its
tax advisors, believes does not have reasonable basis in the Code and other
applicable federal income tax law. Parent shall give Titan Representative
prompt notice of the commencement of any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to a Titan Tax Return and shall provide such information
regarding the proceeding as Titan Representative may reasonably request.
Parent and Titan Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return of the Partnership, General Partner or any
Partnership Subsidiary and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Partnership, General Partner or any
Partnership Subsidiary. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other partys reasonable request) the provision of records and  



 

\- 52 -  information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

member has requested such acquisition. The parties hereby agree that any such
acquisition shall be subject to the prior approval of the General Partner,
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

or any of their respective assets, or against any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
stockholders, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

(a) The parties hereto agree that it is desirable to designate the Titan
Representative to act on behalf of the holders of Equity Securities of
the General Partner and the Partnership for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein. The General Partner and the Partnership have designated the
Titan Representative as the representative of the holders of Equity Securities
of the General Partner and the Partnership and any other parties entitled to
receive a portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price, and approval of this
Agreement by such holders shall constitute ratification and approval of such
designation.

(b) The Titan Representative shall be authorized and empowered, as agent of
and on behalf of all holders of Equity Securities of the General Partner
and the Partnership and any other parties entitled to receive a portion of
the Aggregate Purchase Price, to take such actions contemplated by Section 3.4
hereof and Section 6.9 hereof and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Titan
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement.

(c) In dealing with this Agreement and any notice, instrument, agreement or
document relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all
or any of the powers conferred upon the Titan Representative hereunder or
thereunder, (i) the Titan Representative and its agents, counsel, accountants
and other representatives shall not assume any, and shall incur no,
responsibility whatsoever (in each case, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) to the holders of Equity Securities of the Partnership or the
General Partner, or to Parent or the Surviving Partnership by reason of any
error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or
in connection with this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or
document, other than in respect of an act or omission done in bad faith or
with gross negligence on the part of the Titan Representative, and (ii) the
Titan Representative shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of
counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the
matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the

Partnership or the General Partner, or to Parent or the Surviving Partnership.
Pursuant to the following sentence, and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the holders of Equity Securities of the Partnership and the
General Partner shall be, severally (based on each such holders _pro rata_
share of the Escrow Amount) and not jointly, obligated to indemnify the Titan
