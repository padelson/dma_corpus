AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 7, 2019 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between HopFed Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _HopFed_
"), and First Financial Corporation, an Indiana corporation (" _First
Financial_ ").

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of First Financial and HopFed have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein, pursuant to which HopFed will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, merge with and into First Financial (the " _Merger_ "), so that
First Financial is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred
to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code"_ ), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement for First Financial to enter into this Agreement,
the directors of HopFed, in their capacity as shareholders, and certain
shareholders of HopFed have simultaneously herewith entered into a voting
agreement (collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in connection with the
Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the " _IBCL_ ") and the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
HopFed shall merge with and into First Financial. First Financial shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Indiana. At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of HopFed shall terminate.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_ The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Indiana (the " _Indiana_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Secretary_ ") and the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "),
respectively, on the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Certificates of
Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificates of Merger.

 



 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the IBCL and the
DGCL.

 



 

1.4 _Conversion of HopFed Common Stock_

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each share of the
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of HopFed issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _HopFed Common Stock_ "), shall
become and be converted into the right to receive in accordance with this
Agreement, at the election of the holder thereof and as provided in and
subject to the provisions of Section 1.5 and Section 2.2, either (or a
combination of):

 



 

(i) 0.444 shares, as may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares, the " _Stock
Consideration_ ") of the common shares, no par value per share, of First
Financial (the " _First Financial Common Stock_ "); it being understood that
upon the Effective Time, the First Financial Common Stock, including the
shares issued to former holders of HopFed Common Stock, shall be the common
shares of the Surviving Corporation; or,

 



 

(ii) $21.00 in cash (the cash consideration to be paid in the Merger is
referred to herein as the " _Cash Consideration_ ") (with the aggregate of the
Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration being paid for all outstanding
shares of HopFed Common Stock collectively referred to herein as the " _Merger
Consideration_ ");

 



 

provided, however, that in the aggregate, fifty percent (50%) of HopFeds
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted and exchanged for First Financial common stock and fifty
percent (50%) of HopFeds common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for cash, in accordance with the
election allocation provisions of Section 1.5. In the event of a reduction in
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 7.2(h), the Stock Consideration
and the Cash Consideration will each be reduced proportionally.

 



 

(b) All of the shares of HopFed Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ",
it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of HopFed Common Stock) previously representing any
such shares of

 



     

 

 



 

HopFed Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement: (i) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of HopFed Common Stock have been
converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of HopFed Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate
have been converted into the right to receive, and (iii) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2. Old Certificates previously representing shares of HopFed Common
Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration (together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional
shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Old
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and without any
interest thereon.

 



 

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of First Financial
Common Stock or HopFed Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio. (By way of illustration, if First Financial shall declare
a stock dividend of 3% payable with respect to a record date on or prior to
the Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted upward by 3%.). In
addition, in the event that, prior to the Effective Date, First Financial
enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of First Financial Common
Stock would be converted into shares or other securities or obligations of
another corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that
each HopFed shareholder entitled to receive shares of First Financial Common
Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to receive, pro rata, such number of
shares or other securities or amount or obligations of such other corporation
as such shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Date had
occurred immediately prior to the happening of such event.

 



 

(d) The holders of HopFed Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262(b) of the DGCL. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), HopFed Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than HopFed Common Stock to be canceled pursuant
to Section 1.4(e)) and that is held by holders of such HopFed Common Stock who
have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect
thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be convertible into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and

 



     

 

 



 

payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and First Financial shall remain
liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares of HopFed
Common Stock. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. HopFed will
give First Financial (i) notice of any demands received by HopFed for
appraisals of shares of HopFed Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such notices and demands. HopFed shall not, except with the prior written
consent of First Financial, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle any such demands.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of HopFed Common Stock that are owned by HopFed or
First Financial (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or
as a result of debts previously contracted) and all Dissenting Shares
(collectively, the " _Exempt HopFed Stock_ ") shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, no fractional
shares of First Financial Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor,
or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead,
First Financial shall pay to each holder of HopFed Common Stock who otherwise
would be entitled to a fractional share of First Financial Common Stock an
amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by
the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of First Financials
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest cent, during the fifteen (15) consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the second business day prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that closing sales prices shall only be used
for days during which such shares are actually traded on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market.

 



 

1.5 _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Cash and Stock Elections_. An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such certificates to American Stock Transfer and Trust Co. or
such other designated third-party exchange agent mutually agreed upon by First
Financial and HopFed (referred to when acting in such capacity as the "
_Exchange Agent_ ")) in such form as designated by First Financial and the
Exchange Agent (the " _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed along with the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.4) to each holder of
record of HopFed Common Stock as of

 



     

 

 



 

the record date for the HopFed Shareholder Meeting. Each Election Form shall
permit the holder of record of HopFed Common Stock (or in the case of nominee
record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all or a
portion of such holders shares of HopFed Common Stock (a " _Cash Election_
"), (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all or a portion of such
holders shares of HopFed Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ "), or (iii) make
no election with respect to the receipt of the Cash Consideration or the Stock
Consideration (a " _Non-Election_ "); provided, however, that, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section
1.5(f), no more than fifty percent (50%) of the shares of HopFed Common Stock
(the " _Stock Conversion Number_ ") shall be converted into the Stock
Consideration and the remaining shares of HopFed Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Consideration Number_ "). Shares of HopFed
Common Stock as to which a Cash Election has been made are referred to herein
as " _Cash Election Shares_." Shares of HopFed Common Stock as to which a
Stock Election has been made are referred to herein as " _Stock Election
Shares_." Shares of HopFed Common Stock as to which no election has been made
(or as to which an Election Form is not properly completed and returned in a
timely fashion) are referred to herein as " _Non-Election Shares_." The
aggregate number of shares of HopFed Common Stock with respect to which a
Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as the " _Stock Election
Number_."

 



 

(b) _Delivery of Election_. To be effective, a properly completed Election
Form shall be received by the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern
Time, on the date of the HopFed Shareholders Meeting to vote on the Agreement
(the " _Election Deadline_ "), accompanied by the Old Certificates
representing HopFed Common Stock as to which such Election Form is being made
or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set
forth in the Election Form, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States; provided, however, that any such guarantee shall be subject to the
condition that such Old Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange
Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery and failure to
deliver the Old Certificates covered by such guarantee of delivery within the
time set forth in such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise
properly made election, unless otherwise determined by First Financial, in its
sole discretion. For shares of HopFed Common Stock (if any) held in book entry
form, First Financial shall establish procedures for delivery of such shares,
which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to HopFed. If a holder of
HopFed Common Stock either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election
Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes the holders Election Form prior to
the Election Deadline (without later submitting a properly completed Election
Form prior to the Election Deadline), the shares of HopFed Common Stock held
by such holder shall be designated Non-Election

 



     

 

 



 

Shares. All Election Forms shall automatically be revoked, and all Old
Certificates returned, if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by First
Financial and HopFed that this Agreement has been terminated. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither First
Financial nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in an Election Form.

 



 

(c) _Allocation_. The allocation among the holders of shares of HopFed Common
Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration
will be made as set forth in this Section 1.5 (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Cash Election
Shares, Stock Election Shares or Non-Election Shares, as applicable, shall be
rounded up or down).

 



 

(d) _Aggregate Stock Consideration Oversubscribed_. If the Stock Election
Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and, subject to Section 1.4(f) hereof, each holder of Stock
Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock Consideration in respect
of that number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock
Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number,
with the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

 



 

(e) _Aggregate Stock Consideration Undersubscribed_. If the Stock Election
Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock
Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein
as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-
Election Shares and the Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following
manner:

 



 

 _(i)_ _Adjustment to Non-Election Share Allocation Only_. If the Shortfall
Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all
Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and, subject to Section 1.4(f) hereof, each holder of Non-
Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such

 



     

 

 



 

holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and
the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

 



 

 _(ii)_ _Adjustment to Both Non-Election Share Allocation and Cash Election
Share Allocation_. If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration, and, subject to Section 1.4(f) hereof, each
holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall
Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of
which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number
of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

 



 

(f) _Discretion to Adjust Stock Consideration_. In the event the parties
hereto are unable to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections
7.2(c) and 7.3 (c) or the Merger otherwise fails to qualify for the tax
treatment described in Section 1.10, then First Financial may, in its sole
discretion, increase the number of shares of HopFed Common Stock entitled to
receive Stock Consideration by the minimum amount necessary to enable such tax
opinions to be rendered and for the Merger to otherwise qualify for the tax
treatment described in Section 1.10.

 



 

1.6 _First Financial Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each
share of First Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding common share of
the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



     

 

 



 

1.7 _Treatment of HopFed Restricted Stock Awards_.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but contingent upon the Closing),
each award in respect of a share of HopFed Common Stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a HopFed Stock Plan that
is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _HopFed Restricted Stock Award"_ ) shall fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of HopFed Common Stock underlying such
HopFed Restricted Stock Award, less applicable tax withholdings.

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, HopFed, the Board of Directors of
HopFed and its compensation committee, as applicable, and First Financial, the
Board of Directors of First Financial, and its Compensation Committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7, and to ensure that
following the Effective Time, there are no obligations with respect to the
HopFed Stock Plans other than as set forth in this Section 1.7.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _HopFed Stock Plans_ " means the HopFed
Bancorp, Inc. Management Recognition Plan; HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 1999 Stock
Option Plan; HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan; HopFed Bancorp, Inc.
2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan; and HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 2013 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, and all other employee and director equity incentive plans or
agreements of HopFed as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

1.8 _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Articles of Incorporation of First Financial (the " _First Financial
Articles_ "), as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.

 



 

1.9 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Code of
Bylaws of First Financial (the " _First Financial Bylaws_ "), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 



 

1.11 _Bank Merger_. Immediately subsequent to the Effective Time, Heritage
Bank USA, Inc. (" _Heritage Bank_ "), a Kentucky state chartered bank and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of HopFed, will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and
into First Financial Bank,

 



     

 

 



 

N.A. (" _First Financial Bank_ "), a national banking association and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of First Financial. First Financial Bank shall be the
surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Heritage Bank shall cease. First Financial and
HopFed shall cause First Financial Bank and Heritage Bank to enter into the
agreement and plan of merger attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _Bank Merger
Agreement_ ") within five (5) days of the date of this Agreement. HopFed shall
cause Heritage Bank, and First Financial shall cause First Financial Bank, to
execute such articles of merger, certificates of merger and articles of
combination and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make
the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") following the
Effective Time at a time determined pursuant to this _Section 1.11_.

 



 

1.12 _Principal Executive Offices of Surviving Corporation_. The principal
executive offices of First Financial as of the date of this Agreement shall be
the principal executive offices of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.13 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At First Financials
election, the Merger may alternatively be structured so that (a) HopFed is
merged with and into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
First Financial or (b) any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of First
Financial is merged with and into HopFed; _provided, however,_ that no such
change shall: (1) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration or the treatment of the holders of HopFed Common Stock, (2)
prevent the parties from obtaining the opinions of counsel referred to in
Section 7.2(c) or Section 7.3(c) or otherwise cause the transaction to fail to
qualify for the tax treatment described in Section 1.10, or (3) within the
good faith judgment of HopFed, materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of such an election,
the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to
the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business
combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and
obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders) in order to
reflect such election.

shareholder accompanied by a properly completed and executed letter of
transmittal, in the form and substance satisfactory to First Financial, and
any other documents required by this Agreement or reasonably requested by

Common Stock until the holder thereof surrenders such Old Certificates in
accordance with this Article II. After becoming so entitled in accordance with
this _Section 2.2_, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest

cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of First Financial or other
consideration shall be exchanged therefor.

previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(j) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of HopFed for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall

not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the First Financial Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share
of HopFed Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of First Financial, HopFed, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of HopFed Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 



 

(k) If any certificate representing shares of First Financial Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(l) First Financial shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any Cash Consideration or cash in
lieu of fractional shares of First Financial Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ or any other cash
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of HopFed
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
First Financial or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to
the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of HopFed
Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by
First Financial or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HOPFED

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by HopFed to
First Financial concurrently herewith (the " _HopFed Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the HopFed Disclosure Schedule

 



     

 

 



 

as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by HopFed that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section
of Article III shall be deemed to qualify with respect to (1) any other
section of Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2)
other sections of Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections
or (ii) as disclosed in any HopFed Reports filed by HopFed since December 31,
2017, and prior to the date hereof, including without limitation any
information incorporated by reference into such reports (but disregarding risk
factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures
of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), HopFed hereby represents and warrants to First
Financial as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) HopFed is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding company duly registered under
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _BHC Act_ "). HopFed has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. HopFed is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where such
concept is recognized under applicable law, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
HopFed. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
means, with respect to First Financial, HopFed or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A)
changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or
in economic or market conditions affecting the financial services industry
generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries,
including changes in prevailing interest rates, (D) public disclosure of the
transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this
Agreement or actions or omissions that are taken with the prior written

 



     

 

 



 

consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (E) the expenses incurred by HopFed or First Financial in negotiating,
documenting, effecting and consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (F) changes proximately caused by the impact of the execution or
announcement of the Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby on relationships with customers or employees (including
the loss of personnel subsequent to the date of this Agreement); except, with
respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such
change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies
in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the
ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with
respect to any person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, bank or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
or person of which (i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or
controls at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or others performing similar functions or (ii) such first person is
or directly or indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager
or managing member or others performing similar functions. True and complete
copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of HopFed (the " _HopFed Articles_
") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of HopFed (the " _HopFed Bylaws_ "), as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by HopFed to First Financial.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of HopFed (a " _HopFed Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
HopFed and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of HopFed to pay
dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of HopFed that is an insured depository institution are insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or

and complete list of all Subsidiaries of HopFed as of the date hereof.

voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the HopFed Common Stock or other
equity interests of HopFed, other than the Voting Agreements and a Standstill
Agreement as set forth at HopFed Disclosure Schedule 3.2(a). Section 3.2(a) of
the HopFed Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
all HopFed Restricted Stock Awards outstanding as of the date hereof
specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (A) the name of each holder, (B) the
number of shares subject to each such HopFed Restricted Stock Award, (C) the

its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

 



 

(b) HopFed owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
HopFed Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank Subsidiaries,
as provided under 12 U.S.C. §55 or any comparable provision of applicable
state law) and

 



     

 

 



 

free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No HopFed Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 



 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of HopFed and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of HopFed and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end

respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in

in each case, as

 



     

 

 



 

indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
HopFed and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Horne LLP has
not resigned (or informed HopFed that it intends to resign) and neither Horne
LLP nor HopFeds previous independent accountants, Carr, Riggs and Ingram, LLC
and Rayburn|Fitzgerald PC, have been dismissed as independent public
accountants of HopFed as a result of or in connection with any disagreements
with HopFed on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed, neither HopFed nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of HopFed included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2018, or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of HopFed and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of HopFed or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on HopFed. HopFed (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information
relating to HopFed, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of HopFed by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to HopFeds outside auditors and the audit committee of
HopFeds Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect HopFeds ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in HopFeds internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to HopFeds auditors

 



     

 

 



 

and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to First
Financial. There is no reason to believe that HopFeds outside auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2015, (i) neither HopFed nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of HopFed, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of HopFed or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that HopFed or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by HopFed or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to
the Board of Directors of HopFed or any committee thereof or to the knowledge
of HopFed, to any director or officer of HopFed.

nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. HopFed has disclosed to First
Financial as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection
with the engagement by HopFed of Sandler ONeill, related to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon HopFed, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of HopFed or any of

grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against HopFed
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes
against HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither HopFed nor any of its
Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to
with any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of
HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of HopFed, there are
no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any
employees of HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(o) There has been no amendment to any HopFed Benefit Plan or announcement by
HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or change in eligibility for
participation or coverage under any HopFed Benefit Plan that would increase
the annual expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense
incurred for the most recently completed fiscal year plus annual premium
increases or anticipated future increases in premiums based upon normal market
cost increases with respect to any director, officer, employee, independent
contractor or consultant plan, as applicable.

 



 

(p) HopFed and its Subsidiaries have complied with the applicable provisions
of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA") including all provisions
of the ACA applicable to employees, including the employer shared
responsibility provisions relating to the offer of "minimum essential
coverage" to "full-time" employees that is "affordable" and provides "minimum
value" (as defined in Code Section 4980H and related regulations) and the
applicable employer information reporting provisions under Code Sections 6055
and 6056 (and all related regulations).

 



 

(q) With respect to the ESOP:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) HopFed has the authority to take all actions and provide such direction as
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) No event of default has occurred or presently exists under the ESOP Loan
Agreement dated March 2, 2015, by and between the ESOP trustees and HopFed
(the "ESOP Loan Agreement"), the Promissory Note dated March 2, 2015 issued by
the ESOP (the "Promissory Note"), the Stock Purchase Agreement dated March 2,
2015, by and between the ESOP and HopFed (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") or
the ESOP Pledge Agreement dated March 2, 2015, by and between the ESOP and
HopFed (the "Pledge Agreement") (the ESOP Loan Agreement, Promissory Note,
Stock Purchase Agreement and Pledge Agreement referred to collectively as the
"ESOP Loan Documents"). The ESOP has the right under the ESOP Loan Agreement
to prepay at any time the principal amount of the Promissory Note without
penalty and subject only to payment of accrued interest through the date of
prepayment, as contemplated by Section 5.17(d). Except for the Indebtedness
under the ESOP Loan Documents, there is no existing Indebtedness of the ESOP
or HopFed relating to the ESOP.

 



 

(iii) No purchase of shares of HopFed Common Stock by any HopFed Benefit Plan
holding shares of HopFed Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the
ESOP, has adversely affected the tax qualification of such HopFed Benefit Plan
or failed to satisfy all of the requirements for the prohibited transaction
exemption provided by Section 408(e) of ERISA. Each loan to the ESOP which has
been made by or guaranteed by HopFed or any other disqualified person in
connection with any purchase of such shares by the Plan (an "ESOP Loan"),
satisfied each of the requirements of the prohibited transaction exemption
provided in Section 408(b)(3) of ERISA, Section 4975(d)(3) and Treasury
Regulation Section 54-4975-7(b), and, in particular, all shares of HopFed
Common Stock purchased by the ESOP or any other HopFed Benefit Plan were
purchased for no more than "adequate consideration" within the meaning Section
3(18) of ERISA, as determined on the basis of a stock valuation prepared by an
"independent appraiser" (as this term is defined in Section 401(a)(28)(C) of
the Code) satisfying all requirements of Sections 3(18) and 408(e) of ERISA
and applicable DOL regulations.

 



 

(iv) The ESOP is now and has been at all times since its inception a qualified
employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Code Section 4975(e)(7).
The trust maintained to fund the ESOP (the " _ESOP Trust_ ") is a trust duly
formed in accordance with applicable state law and is, and at all times has
been, a trust described in Code Section 501(a). All shares of HopFed Common
Stock owned by the ESOP are and have at all times constituted "employer
securities" as that term is defined in Section 409(l) of the Code and
"qualifying employer securities" as

 



     

 

 



 

defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA. The ESOP Trustee has been duly and
properly appointed and granted full authority to act as trustee of the ESOP
and exercise trust powers thereunder..

 



 

3.12 _SEC Reports_. No communication mailed by HopFed to its shareholders
since December 31, 2015 and prior to the date hereof nor any final
registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule or definitive proxy
statement filed with or furnished to the SEC since December 31, 2015 by HopFed
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "),
or the Exchange Act (the " _HopFed Reports_ "), as of the date thereof (and,
in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. Since December 31, 2015, as of their respective dates, all
HopFed Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. No executive officer of HopFed has failed in any respect to

Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There are no outstanding comments from or unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the HopFed Reports.

 



 

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on Section 3.13(a) of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule,
HopFed and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December
31, 2015, held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their
respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except
where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to
pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed, and to the
knowledge of HopFed no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. HopFed and each of
its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule,

expenses relating to political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to
foreign or domestic governmental officials or employees or to foreign or

Heritage Bank does not have any loans outstanding to, or any commitment to
lend to, any Marijuana Related Business, or any loans secured by real or
personal property owned by, leased to, or occupied or utilized by a Marijuana

3.14 _Certain Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule,
as of the date hereof, neither HopFed nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether
written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any directors, officers
or employees, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (ii) which, upon the execution or delivery of this Agreement,
shareholder adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise) becoming due from First Financial, HopFed, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer or
employee thereof, (iii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iv) which restricts
HopFeds ability to compete or contains a client or customer non-solicit
requirement or any other provision, in each case, that materially restricts
the conduct of any line of business by HopFed or any of its affiliates or upon
consummation of the Merger will materially restrict the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates to engage in any line of
business, (v) with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective
bargaining agreement), (vi) any of the benefits of which contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding (not including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan, performance share unit
plan, stock purchase plan, and related agreements, all of which are listed on
Section 3.2(a) of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule) will be increased, or the
vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder adoption of this
Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on
the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vii)
that relates to the incurrence of indebtedness by HopFed or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than deposit liabilities, trade payables, federal funds
purchased, advances and loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank and securities
sold under agreements to repurchase, in each case incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice) in the principal amount of
$400,000 or more including any sale and leaseback transactions, capitalized
leases and other similar financing transactions, (viii) that grants any right
of first refusal, right of first offer or similar right with respect to any
material assets, rights or properties of HopFed or its Subsidiaries or (ix)
that is a consulting agreement or data processing, software programming or
licensing contract involving the payment of more than $150,000 per annum
(other than any such contracts which are terminable by HopFed or any of its
Subsidiaries on sixty (60) calendar days or less notice without any required
payment or other conditions, other than the condition of notice). Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 3.14(a), whether or not set forth in the HopFed Disclosure
Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _HopFed Contract_ " and neither HopFed
nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation
of the above by

 



     

 

 



 

any of the other parties thereto which would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed.

 



 

(b) Each HopFed Contract is valid and binding on HopFed or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on HopFed. HopFed and each of its Subsidiaries has in
all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it
to date under each HopFed Contract, except where such noncompliance, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on HopFed. To HopFeds knowledge each third-party
counterparty to each HopFed Contract has in all material respects performed
all obligations required to be performed by it to date under such HopFed
Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on HopFed, and no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice
or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of
HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries under any such HopFed Contract, except where
such default, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed.

 



 

3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Except as set forth on Section
3.15 of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule, neither HopFed nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2015, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2015,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the HopFed Disclosure Schedule, a
" _HopFed Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries
been advised since January 1, 2015, by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity of any potential action that could restrict the business
of HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries in any material respect; provided
however, such HopFed Disclosure Schedules shall not include confidential
supervisory information (in accordance with 12 CFR 309), if applicable, unless
prior regulatory approval is received related to the dissemination of such
information.

 



 

3.16 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar derivative
transactions and risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the
account of HopFed, any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of
HopFed or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and in

 



     

 

 



 

accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory
Agency and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the
time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of HopFed or one of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions), and are in full force and effect.
HopFed and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material
respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued, and, to HopFeds knowledge, there are no
material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such
by any party thereunder.

 



 

3.17 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed,
HopFed and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have complied, with any
federal, state or local law, regulation, order, decree, permit, authorization,
common law or agency requirement relating to: (i) the protection or
restoration of the environment, health and safety as it relates to hazardous
substance exposure or natural resource damages, (ii) the handling, use,
presence, disposal, release or threatened release of, or exposure to, any
hazardous substance, or (iii) noise, odor, wetlands, indoor air, pollution,
contamination or any injury to persons or property from exposure to any
hazardous substance (collectively, " _Environmental Laws_ "). Except as set
forth on Section 3.17 of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule, there are no legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims or actions, or to the
knowledge of HopFed any private environmental investigations or remediation
activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or
that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on HopFed or
any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any
Environmental Law, pending or threatened against HopFed, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed. To the knowledge of HopFed,
there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on HopFed. HopFed is not subject to any agreement,
order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of agreement by or
with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party
imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on HopFed.

 



 

3.18 _Investment Securities and Commodities_.

 



 

(a) Each of HopFed and its Subsidiaries has good title to all securities and
commodities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase agreements), free
and clear of any Lien, except to the extent such securities or commodities are
pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure obligations of HopFed or
its Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the books of
HopFed in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.

 



 

(b) HopFed and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,

 



     

 

 



 

practices and procedures that HopFed believes are prudent and reasonable in
the context of such businesses. Prior to the date of this Agreement, HopFed
has made available to First Financial the material terms of such policies,
practices and procedures.

acquired after the date hereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed
of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice) (the " _HopFed Owned Properties_ "), free and clear of all
material Liens, except statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, Liens
for real property Taxes not yet due and payable, easements, rights of way, and
other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the value or use of
the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties and such
imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially affect
the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected
thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties
(collectively, " _Permitted Encumbrances_ "), and is the lessee of all
leasehold estates reflected in Section 3.19 of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule
or acquired after the date hereof (except for leases that have expired by
their terms since the date thereof) (the " _HopFed Leased Properties_ " and,
collectively with the HopFed Owned Properties, the " _HopFed Real Property_
"), free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Encumbrances, and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to HopFeds knowledge, the lessor. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of HopFed, threatened condemnation proceedings against the HopFed
Real Property.

 



 

3.20 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) HopFed and its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise possess
sufficient legally enforceable rights to use, all material Intellectual
Property (as defined in Section 3.20(g)) that is used by HopFed or its
Subsidiaries in their respective businesses as currently conducted. Neither

(c) To HopFeds knowledge, no third party has infringed, misappropriated, or
otherwise violated HopFeds or any of its Subsidiaries Intellectual Property
rights during the preceding five (5) years. There are no claims asserted or

measures to protect the confidentiality of all trade secrets that are owned,
used, or held by them.

 



 

(e) None of the Software (as defined in subsection (g) below): (i) to HopFeds
knowledge, contains any bug, defect, or error that materially and adversely
affects the use, functionality, or performance of such Software or any system
containing or used in conjunction with such Software (collectively, "
_Defective Code_ ") or (ii) to HopFeds knowledge, fails to comply with any
applicable warranty or other contractual commitment relating to the use,

storage, system redundancy, and disaster avoidance and recovery procedures, as

Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the DGCL or federal law.

 



 

3.24 _Reorganization_. HopFed has not taken any action and is not aware of any

Subsidiaries which is provided by HopFed or its representatives for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any other document filed with any
other Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to

all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

 



 

3.27 _Loan Portfolio_.

 



 

(a) As of the date hereof, except as set forth in Section 3.27(a) of the
HopFed Disclosure Schedule, neither HopFed nor any of its Subsidiaries is a

Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth
as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not
result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or

an admission by First Financial that such item represents a material exception
or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (c) any disclosures made with respect
to a section of Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of

applicable law, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or

 



     

 

 



 

leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either

licensed or qualified or in good standing would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on

that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
First Financials internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to First Financials auditors

ARTICLE V 
COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

 



 

HopFed covenants and agrees with First Financial and covenants and agrees to
cause its Subsidiaries to act as follows (and First Financial covenants and
agrees with HopFed as follows):

 



 

5.1 _Shareholder Approval_.

 



 

(a) HopFed shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders for approval and
adoption at a meeting to be called and/or held in accordance with applicable
law and the HopFed Articles and Bylaws (the "HopFed Shareholders Meeting") as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and the
effectiveness of the S-4. The Board of Directors of HopFed shall recommend to
HopFeds shareholders that such shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger contemplated hereby and will, in the event of an actual
shareholders meeting, solicit proxies voting in favor of this Agreement from
HopFeds shareholders. Additionally, each director of HopFed and Heritage

 



     

 

 



 

Bank and certain shareholders of HopFed as set forth on Section 7.2(i) of the
HopFed Disclosure Schedule, shall agree to vote or direct the vote of any
shares of HopFed Common Stock he or she owns, beneficially or of record or has
the power to vote (subject to any fiduciary duties of such individual), in
favor of the Merger pursuant to the agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.1(b), neither the HopFed Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify,
amend, or fail to make, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify, or
amend its recommendation that the shareholders of HopFed approve this
Agreement (or fail to include such recommendation in the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement), (ii) make any public statement or take any action inconsistent
with its recommendation that the shareholders of HopFed approve this
Agreement, or (iii) approve or adopt, or recommend the approval or adoption
of, or publicly propose to approve or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal (any of
the actions described in (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Change of Recommendation").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Requisite HopFed Vote:

 



 

(i) HopFeds Board of Directors may make a Change of Recommendation if (A)
other than in connection with or as a result of the making of an Acquisition
Proposal, a material development or change in circumstances that was not known
or, with respect to material developments or changes in circumstances relating
to HopFed and its Subsidiaries, reasonably foreseeable to HopFeds Board of
Directors on or before the date of this Agreement occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement, which material development or change in circumstances
becomes known to HopFeds Board of Directors prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Requisite HopFed Vote (such material development or change in
circumstances being referred to as an "Intervening Event") (it being
understood that in no event shall the receipt, existence, or terms of an
Acquisition Proposal constitute an Intervening Event), (B) HopFeds Board of
Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors) that an Intervening Event has occurred and a
failure to make a Change of Recommendations would cause it to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, (C) HopFeds Board of Directors does
not effect, or cause HopFed to effect, a Change of Recommendation at any time
within three (3) business days, or such shorter period in the event that the
HopFed Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to occur in less than three (3)
business days, after First Financial receives written notice from HopFed that
the HopFed Board of Directors has determined that an Intervening Event
requires the HopFed Board of Directors to effect, or cause HopFed to effect, a
Change of Recommendation and describing in

 



      

 

 



 

reasonable detail the circumstances underlying such determination (provided, a
new notice shall be required with respect to any material change in
circumstances and a new notice period of three (3) business days, or shorter
period in the circumstances above, shall begin), and (D) during such
applicable period, HopFed engages in good faith negotiations with First
Financial (to the extent that First Financial desires to negotiate) to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the HopFed Board of
Directors to effect, or cause HopFed to effect, a Change of Recommendation; or

 



 

(ii) if, in response to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that did not
arise or result from any material breach of Section 5.6, the HopFed Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that a failure to make a Change of
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal would cause it to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the HopFed Board of
Directors may, with respect to such Superior Proposal, (x) make a Change of
Recommendation or (y) cause HopFed to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
such Superior Proposal if, in each case:

 



 

A. HopFed has provided written notice to First Financial (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising First Financial that the HopFed Board of
Directors has received a Superior Proposal promptly after the HopFed Board of
Directors determines it has received a Superior Proposal (and in any event
within two (2) business days), stating that the HopFed Board of Directors
intends to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(g) and describing in reasonable detail the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, and

 



 

B. First Financial does not, within three (3) business days of receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), make a written offer or
proposal to revise the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a "Revised
Transaction Proposal") in a manner that the HopFed Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors), to be at least as favorable to HopFeds shareholders as such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, during the Notice Period, HopFed
shall negotiate in good faith with First Financial (to the extent First
Financial desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised Transaction Proposal;
provided, further, that any amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal
during the

 



     

 

 



 

Notice Period shall require a new written notice of the material terms of such
amended Superior Proposal from HopFed and an additional three (3) business day
Notice Period, including with respect to HopFeds obligations to negotiate in
good faith with First Financial.

 



 

(iii) "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made
by a third party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal that (i) HopFeds Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the shareholders of HopFed than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account all factors
relating to such proposed transaction deemed relevant by HopFeds Board of
Directors, including without limitation the amount and form of consideration,
the timing of payment, the risk of consummation of the transaction, the
financing thereof and all other conditions thereto, (including any adjustments
to the terms and conditions of such transactions proposed by First Financial
in response to such Acquisition Proposal)).

 



 

5.2 _Other Approvals_.

 



 

(a) HopFed shall proceed expeditiously, cooperate fully, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist First Financial in procuring, upon terms and
conditions consistent with the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c) _
hereof, all consents, authorizations, approvals, registrations, and
certificates, in completing all filings and applications, and in satisfying
all other requirements prescribed by law which are necessary for consummation
of the Merger (including, without limitation, requirements for any potential
branch closings) on the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement at the
earliest possible reasonable date.

 



 

(b) HopFed will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required
third party consents to agreements, contracts, commitments, leases,
instruments, and documents described in Section 3.3(b) of the HopFed
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) Any written materials or information provided by HopFed to First Financial
for use by First Financial in any filing with any Regulatory Agency shall not
contain any untrue or misleading statement of material fact or shall omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not false or misleading.

 



     

 

 



 

5.3 _Conduct of Business_.

 



 

(a) After the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time or until

Subsidiaries shall: (1) carry on its business diligently, substantially in the
manner as is presently being conducted, and in the ordinary course of
business; (2) use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business
organization intact, keep available the services of the present officers and
employees, and preserve its present relationships with customers and persons
having business dealings with it; (3) use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain all of the properties and assets that it owns or utilizes in the

books, records, and accounts in the usual, regular, and ordinary manner, on a
basis consistent with prior years and in compliance in all material respects
with all statutes, laws, rules, and regulations applicable to them and to the
conduct of its business; and (5) not knowingly do or fail to do anything which
will cause a breach of, or default in, any contract, agreement, commitment,
obligation, understanding, arrangement, lease, or license to which it is a
party or by which it is or may be subject or bound. Specifically, by way of
example but not limitation, after the date of this Agreement and until the
Effective Time or until this Agreement is terminated as herein provided,
HopFed will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries to not, without the prior
written consent of First Financial, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld:

 



 

(i) make any changes in its capital stock (including, without limitation, any
stock issuance, stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, or
reclassification), authorize a class of stock, or issue any stock, issue or

to its authorized or issued capital stock or any securities convertible into
shares of such stock, or redeem any of its outstanding shares of common stock
or other securities;

 



 

(ii) distribute or pay any dividends on its shares of common stock, or
authorize a stock split, or make any other distribution to its shareholders,
except for HopFeds regular quarterly cash dividend in an amount not to exceed
$0.07 per share ; _provided, however_ , HopFed and First Financial shall
coordinate HopFeds dividend schedule for the quarter in which Closing occurs
so that holders of HopFed Common Stock do not receive dividends or
distributions on both First Financial and HopFed Common Stock attributable to
the same calendar quarter, it being understood that First Financial may
withhold consent in its sole discretion to, among other things, better
coordinate any pre- and post-Closing dividends; _provided, further_ , Heritage
Bank may pay cash dividends to HopFed in the ordinary course of business for
payment of reasonable and necessary

 



     

 

 



 

business and operating expenses of HopFed, including expenses of the Merger;

of three (3) years or less, or sell any investment security owned by them
other than sales made in the ordinary course of business as previously
conducted during the past three (3) years and in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations, or engage in any activity that would be inconsistent
with the classification of investment securities as either "held to maturity"
or "available for sale";

"Other Loans Especially Mentioned," "Substandard," "Doubtful," or "Loss" and
the aggregate credit exposure to such person is in excess of $250,000.
Heritage Bank also shall not make, purchase, renew, modify, amend, or extend
the maturity of (1) any new commercial Loan that would increase the aggregate
credit exposure of any one borrower to amounts in excess of $4,500,000;
provided, that Heritage Bank may, without the consent of First Financial,
renew, modify, amend, or extend the maturity of existing performing commercial
Loans (which are not classified or non-accrual) with customers with existing
aggregate credit exposure of $4,500,000 or less; and, provided further, that
any previously approved and committed commercial Loans by Heritage Bank are
not subject to this Section 5.3, (2) any 1 to 4 family, residential mortgage
Loan in excess of $500,000 and with a loan to value in excess of 90% (unless
private mortgage insurance is obtained); provided, that in the event the Loan
is to be investor sold, such Loans will not be subject to this subsection if
the Loan meets the criteria of the investor, (3) any consumer Loan in excess
of $150,000, (4) any home equity Loan or line of credit in excess of $300,000,
or (5) any Loan participation; provided, that HopFed or Heritage Bank may take
any such action in respect of any such Loan or Loans if the Chief Credit
Officer of First Financial shall be provided with notice of the proposed
action in writing and First Financial shall not provide written objection to
the taking of such proposed action within three (3) business days of being
provided with such notice (the lack of such objection being deemed prior

 



     

 

 



 

written consent of First Financial for purposes of this sub paragraph Section
5.3(a)(iv));

 



 

(v) acquire any assets of any other person by any means (other than personal
property acquired in foreclosure or otherwise in the ordinary course of
collection of indebtedness owed to Heritage Bank) or foreclose upon or
otherwise take title to or possession or control of, any real property without
first obtaining a Phase I environmental report thereon, prepared by a reliable
and qualified person acceptable to First Financial, which indicates that the
real property is free of any Recognized Environmental Conditions (a " _REC_
"), including, without limitation, pollutants, contaminants, petroleum
products, or hazardous materials; provided, however, that neither HopFed nor
Heritage Bank shall be required to obtain such a report with respect to single
family, non-agricultural residential property of one acre or less to be
foreclosed upon unless HopFed has reason to believe that such property might
contain a REC or other such hazardous materials or otherwise might be
contaminated;

such consultants, directors, officers, or employees;

 



 

(vii) fail to accrue, pay, discharge and satisfy all debts, liabilities,

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, HopFed shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to make, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations,

Merger including, without limitation, accruals or the creation of reserves for
employee benefits and Merger-related expenses.

 



 

(b) HopFed recognizes that First Financial may have adopted different loan and

faith with First Financial with respect to determining, as reasonably
specified in a written notice from First Financial to HopFed, based upon such

5.6 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) HopFed will, and will cause its and its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than First Financial with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.

HopFed Vote, in the event HopFed receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the
extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be reasonably
likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
provided, further, that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, HopFed shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement and which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with HopFed.

 



 

(c) HopFed will promptly (within three business days) advise First Financial
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance
thereof (including a summary of the terms and conditions of such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep First Financial apprised of any updated
developments within two business days thereafter, including any amendments to
or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. HopFed,
subject to its fiduciary duties, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any

 



     

 

 



 

existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of HopFed and
its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
HopFed or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of HopFed, (ii) any tender
offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of HopFed or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated
assets of HopFed, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving HopFed or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated
assets of HopFed.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent HopFed or its board of
directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required
disclosure to its shareholders; provided, that such Rules will in no way
eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would
otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



 

5.7 _Press Releases_. First Financial and HopFed shall use reasonable efforts
(i) to develop a joint communications plan with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to ensure that all press releases
and other public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (iii) except where (and to the extent that) such
prior consultation is not reasonably possible due to time considerations in
respect of any announcement required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market (in which instance, each party agrees to immediately provide the other
with a copy of such press release or other public statement upon its release)
to consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

5.8 _Changes and Supplements to Disclosure Schedules_. HopFed shall promptly
supplement, amend, and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the
Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the HopFed Disclosure Schedule
with respect to any matters or events hereafter arising which, if in existence
or having occurred as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required
to be set forth or described in the HopFed Disclosure Schedule or this
Agreement and including, without limitation, any fact which, if existing or
known as of the date hereof, would have made any of the representations or
warranties of HopFed contained herein incorrect, untrue or

 



      

 

 



 

misleading. No such supplement, amendment, or update shall have any effect for
the purposes of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VII or become part of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule unless First
Financial shall have first consented in writing with respect thereof.

 



 

5.9 _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. In the event HopFed determines that a
condition to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled, it
will promptly notify First Financial of such occurrence in writing.

 



 

5.10 _Access; Information_.

 



 

(a) First Financial, and its representatives and agents, shall, upon
reasonable notice to HopFed, during normal business hours prior to the
Effective Time, have reasonable access to the properties, facilities,
operations, books, and records of HopFed. First Financial and its
representatives and agents may, prior to the Effective Time, make or cause to
be made such reasonable investigation of the operations, books, records, and
properties of HopFed and its Subsidiaries and of their financial and legal
condition as deemed necessary or advisable to familiarize itself with such
operations, books, records, properties, and other matters; _provided,
however,_ that such access or investigation shall not interfere unnecessarily
with the normal business operations of HopFed or its Subsidiaries. In
addition, after receipt of all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, HopFed shall
cooperate with First Financial to facilitate introductions to Heritage Banks
customers and key business partners and referral sources.

 



 

(b) No investigation by First Financial or HopFed shall affect the
representations and warranties made by HopFed or First Financial herein.

 



 

(c) Any confidential information or trade secrets received by First Financial,
HopFed, or their representatives or agents in the course of such examination
will be treated confidentially, and any correspondence, memoranda, records,
copies, documents, and electronic or other media of any kind containing such
confidential information or trade secrets or both shall be destroyed by First
Financial or HopFed, as applicable, or at First Financials or HopFeds
request, returned to First Financial or HopFed, as applicable, in the event
this Agreement is terminated as provided in Article VIII hereof; provided,
however, that the parties may retain such received confidential information to
comply with applicable law or regulation or professional standard or bona fide
internal compliance policy requirements. Additionally, any confidential
information or trade secrets received by First Financial or HopFed, or either
of their agents or representatives in the course of their examinations
(whether conducted prior to or after the date of this Agreement) shall be
treated confidentially and in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
(as defined in Section 9.7). This Section 5.10 will not require the disclosure
of any information to First Financial or HopFed which would be prohibited by
law or regulation or which in the opinion of respective counsel would be
contrary to maintaining the attorney-client privilege

 



     

 

 



 

with respect to such information or which disclosure is restricted in
accordance with applicable confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements or
provisions.

 



 

(d) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or any Regulatory
Agency, in order to provide for a smooth transition after the Closing, HopFed
shall provide First Financial with copies of minutes and consents from all
such Board and committee meetings no later than fourteen (14) days thereafter;
provided that such materials shall not include matters related to discussions
concerning the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any other
matters that the Board of Directors or its counsel has reasonably determined
to be confidential with respect to participation by First Financial.

 



 

5.11 _Financial Statements_. As soon as internally available after the date of
this Agreement, HopFed will deliver to First Financial any additional audited
consolidated financial statements which are prepared on its behalf or at its
direction, the monthly consolidated unaudited balance sheets and profit and
loss statements of HopFed prepared for its internal use, Heritage Banks Call
Reports for each quarterly period completed prior to the Effective Time, all
other financial reports or statements submitted to Regulatory Agencies after
the date hereof, and all other financial statements and financial information
of either HopFed alone or on a consolidated basis reasonably requested by
First Financial (collectively, " _Subsequent HopFed Financial Statements_ ").
The Subsequent HopFed Financial Statements will be prepared on a basis
consistent with past accounting practices and GAAP (to the extent applicable)
and shall present fairly the financial condition and results of operations as
of the dates and for the periods presented (except in the case of unaudited
financial statements or Call Report information for the absence of notes
and/or year-end adjustments).

 



 

5.12 _Environmental._ HopFed will cooperate with an environmental consulting
firm mutually agreed upon by First Financial and HopFed (the "Designated
Environmental Consultant") in connection with the conduct, at any time after
the date hereof (the "Investigation Period"), by the Designated Environmental
Consultant of Phase I environmental site assessments and any other
investigation reasonably ordered by First Financial on all real property owned
or leased by HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement or acquired thereafter, including OREO. First Financial will proceed
with such assessments, testing, and investigations as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement and will diligently work to
pursue such assessments, testing, and investigations through completion. First
Financial shall furnish true and complete copies of any reports of the
Designated Environmental Consultant that it receives with respect to any
HopFed property, promptly upon First Financials receipt of such reports.
First Financial and HopFed shall each bear 50% of the costs and expenses of
the initial Phase I environmental site assessments (or other similar
assessments) and also of any Phase II environmental site assessments or other
environmental investigation or testing as determined to be necessary or
required due to the presence of any RECs on the Phase I (or other similar
assessments) or to the extent otherwise advisable or recommended by the
Designated Environmental Consultant. First Financial shall manage the
relationship with the Designated Environmental Consultant, and will submit
invoices to

 



     

 

 



 

HopFed for the prompt payment of its share of the costs and expenses. In the
event that the contemplated transaction does not close for any reason and the
Agreement is terminated, First Financial shall return to HopFed all materials
produced by the Designated Environmental Consultant, by First Financial or by
HopFed in accordance with this Section 5.12 or such materials shall be
destroyed by First Financial, and First Financial shall be restricted from
making any disclosure of such information or materials to any party whatsoever
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement for all time thereafter
without regard to the termination of the Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

5.13 _Governmental Reports and Shareholder Information_. Promptly upon its
becoming available, HopFed shall furnish to First Financial one (1) copy of
each financial statement, report, notice, or proxy statement sent by HopFed to
any Governmental Entity or to HopFeds shareholders, and of any order issued
by any Governmental Entity.

 



 

5.14 _Adverse Actions_. HopFed shall not knowingly take any action that is

and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
respect at any time at or prior to the Effective Time, (b) any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied, (c) a
material violation of any provision of this Agreement, or (d) a material delay
in the consummation of the Merger except, in each case, as may be required by

5.15 _Employee Benefits and Employees_

 



 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the actions contemplated hereby shall: (a)
create any employment contract, agreement, or understanding with or employment
rights for, or constitute a commitment or obligation of employment to, any of
the officers or employees of HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries; or (b)
prohibit or restrict First Financial or its Subsidiaries, whether before or
after the Effective Time, from changing, amending, or terminating any employee
benefits provided to its employees from time to time.

 



 

(b) Before the date that is sixty (60) days after the public announcement of
the Merger, First Financial will use its reasonable best efforts to notify
HopFed of the employees First Financial intends to retain after the Effective
Time. Prior to the Closing Date, HopFed shall be responsible for timely giving
any notices to, and terminating as of the Effective Time, any employees whose
employment will not be continued by First Financial after the Effective Time,
and HopFed shall pay any and all amounts which are then due and payable to
such employees in connection with the termination of their employment as of
the Effective Time, including, without limitation, all accrued vacation and
sick pay.

 



 

(c) Before Closing, with HopFeds prior consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), First Financial may conduct such training and

 



     

 

 



 

other programs as it may, in its reasonable discretion and at its sole
expense, elect to provide for those employees who will be continuing
employment with First Financial; provided, however, that such training and
other programs shall not materially interfere with or prevent the performance
of the normal business operations of HopFed.

 



 

5.16 _Change in Control Payments and Termination; Nonsolicitation Agreements_.

 



 

(a) Any HopFed or HopFed Subsidiary employee who has or is party to, or
entitled to benefits pursuant to, any employment agreement (including, any
agreements which require payment upon termination, with or without cause, of
the employees employment), change in control retention agreement, deferred
compensation arrangement, severance agreement, change in control agreement,
the Heritage Bank USA, Inc. Employee Change in Control Severance Compensation
Plan, or any other agreement, plan, or arrangement providing for the payment
of additional compensation related to termination of employment as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but excluding compensation
previously accrued, earned or awarded without regard to such transactions (by
way of example, such plans or arrangements not deemed to be CIC Agreements
include, but are not limited to, retirement benefits, ESOP benefits, 401K plan
benefits, accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards, supplemental
retirement or salary continuation benefits, payout of accrued but unused
vacation, sick leave or other paid time-off, or continuation of participation
under other HopFed Benefit Plans (collectively, the "CIC Agreements"), that
provides for any payment that may be triggered by or in connection with the
Merger or the Bank Merger (collectively, a "CIC Payment"), shall not receive
any severance benefits that may be payable under HopFed or First Financial
severance policies, but will receive the CIC Payment to the extent it is
required to be paid under such agreement, plan, or arrangement. Section
5.16(a) of the HopFed Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all individuals
potentially entitled to a CIC Payment, including the amount of such payment.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 5.16(c), HopFed will pay out or accrue in accordance
with GAAP all CIC Payments, as identified on Section 5.16(a) of the HopFed
Disclosure Schedule, as if the payments had been triggered by the Merger.

 



 

(c) On or before the Closing, HopFed will take all steps necessary to ensure
that in the event that any payments to be made by HopFed or First Financial,
either individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any
other plan, agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for purposes of Code
Section 280G (in the aggregate, "Total Payments"), would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that is
subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of such Code, then the amounts of
the payments to the employee shall be reduced such that the value of the Total
Payments that the employee is entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the

 



     

 

 



 

maximum amount which the employee may receive without becoming subject to the
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or resulting in a disallowance of a
deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, HopFed shall cause to
be delivered to First Financial a nonsolicitation and non-disclosure agreement
in a form acceptable to First Financial (the "Nonsolicitation Agreements")
duly executed by each of individuals set forth on Section 5.16(d)(i) of the
First Financial Disclosure Schedule. With respect to those individuals set
forth on Section 5.16(d)(ii) of the First Financial Disclosure Schedule,
HopFed shall, prior to the Effective Time, use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain from each individual a duly executed Nonsolicitation Agreement.

 



 

(e) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, HopFed shall cause to
be delivered to First Financial a mutual termination of employment agreement
and release in a form acceptable to First Financial (the "Mutual Termination
Agreements") duly executed by each of individuals set forth on Section
5.16(e)(i) of the First Financial Disclosure Schedule. With respect to those
other employees who are entitled to a CIC Payment (each of whom is named on
either Section 5.16(a) of the HopFed Disclosures Schedules or Section
5.16(d)(ii) of the First Financial Disclosure Schedules), HopFed shall, if
requested by First Financial and prior to the Effective Time, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from each individual a settlement agreement and
release upon terms mutually agreeable to HopFed, First Financial and such
employee, setting forth the method in which his or her rights under the CIC
Payment will be settled (the "Settlement Agreements"). Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, HopFed shall make the payments required pursuant to such
CIC Payments in a lump sum.

 



 

5.17 _Termination of HopFed ESOP and HopFed 401(k) Plan_.

 



 

(a) HopFed shall make timely contributions to the ESOP between the date hereof
and the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the ESOP and past
practices, including, without limitation, any contributions required pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the ESOP Loan Documents. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, HopFed shall accrue and pay a final
contribution of principal and interest calculated in accordance with the loan
amortization schedule under the terms of the ESOP Loan Documents to the ESOP
for the period from the date of the last such contribution of principal and
interest made by HopFed or Heritage Bank through the last day of the month
immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) On or before the Effective Time, HopFed shall direct the trustee of the
ESOP to (i) provide to the ESOP participants similar notices and materials
provided to other HopFed shareholders with respect to those matters requiring
a vote of the shareholders under this Agreement; (ii) obtain direction from
the

 



     

 

 



 

HopFed ESOP participants as to how to vote those shares of HopFed Common Stock
allocated to the accounts of the ESOP participants with respect to those
matters for which shareholder vote is required under this Agreement; (iii)
vote those shares of HopFed Common Stock in accordance with the direction of
the ESOP participants and in accordance with the ESOP; and (iv) vote the
shares of HopFed Common Stock for which no participant investment direction
has been timely received by the trustee in accordance with the ESOP.

 



 

(c) No later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, HopFed, pursuant to
the provisions of the ESOP, shall, subject to review by First Financial: (i)
adopt resolutions to terminate, subject to the consummation of the Merger, the
ESOP, consistent with the provisions of Code Section 401(k)(10), effective as
of a date that is not later than the day before the Effective Time (the "ESOP
Termination Date") and (ii) amend the ESOP effective as of a date not later
than the ESOP Termination Date to freeze participation in and benefit accruals
under the ESOP, to vest fully all accrued benefits and to provide that no
distributions of accrued benefits shall be made from the ESOP, or the ESOP
trust, subsequent to the ESOP Termination Date until such time as the Internal
Revenue Service issues a favorable determination letter to the effect that the
plan termination does not adversely affect the ESOPs qualification for
favorable income tax treatment under the Code, other than distributions
required by the terms of the ESOP Plan to be made upon retirement, death,
disability, or termination of employment, or any other event, other than the
plan termination, that requires a distribution from the ESOP.

 



 

(d) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, HopFed
will file, or cause to be filed, with the Internal Revenue Service an
application for a favorable determination letter upon termination of the ESOP
requesting the issuance to HopFed of the favorable determination letter
described in Section 5.17(c). A copy of the completed and filed application
shall be provided to First Financial at least five (5) business days prior to
the Effective Time. On the Closing Date, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, HopFed shall direct the ESOP Trustee to cause the unpaid principal
balance and accrued interest through the Closing Date of the Promissory Note
(such unpaid principal and accrued interest shall be referred to as the "ESOP
Loan Balance") to be repaid by remitting a sufficient number of Suspense
Shares to HopFed or any other lender (including First Financial, as successor
in interest to HopFed, as applicable) to repay the ESOP Loan Balance with such
Suspense Shares being tendered for such ESOP loan payment valued as the
greater of the Cash Merger Consideration of $21.00 per share or the Stock
Merger Consideration of (0.444) times the fair market value of the First
Financial common stock per share as of the Effective Time . All remaining
shares of HopFed Common Stock held by the ESOP (including the remaining
Suspense Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) HopFed shall make timely contributions to the HopFed 401(k) Plan between
the date hereof and the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the HopFed
401(k) Plan and past practices, including, without limitation, elective
deferral contributions of those HopFed 401(k) Plan participants who are
employed by HopFed or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) No later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, HopFed, pursuant to
the provisions of the HopFed 401(k) Plan, shall, subject to review and
approval by First Financial: (i) adopt resolutions to terminate, subject to
the consummation of the Merger, the HopFed 401(k) Plan, consistent with the
provisions of Code Section 401(k)(10), effective as of a date that is not
later than the day before the Effective Time (the "Plan Termination Date") and
(ii) amend the HopFed 401(k) Plan effective as of a date not later than the
Plan Termination Date to freeze participation in and benefit accruals under
the HopFed 401(k) Plan, to vest fully all accrued benefits and to provide that
no distributions of accrued benefits shall be made from the HopFed 401(k)
Plan, or its related employee benefit trust, subsequent to the Plan
Termination Date until such time as the Internal Revenue Service issues a
favorable determination letter to the effect that the plan termination does
not adversely affect the HopFed 401(k) Plans qualification for favorable
income tax treatment under the Code, other than distributions required by the
terms of the HopFed 401(k) Plan to be made upon retirement, death, disability,
or termination of employment, or any other event, other than the plan
termination, that requires a distribution from the HopFed 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(g) Any contributions due to the HopFed 401(k) Plan for the period prior to
the Plan Termination Date, and not yet paid on the Plan Termination Date, will
be contributed by HopFed as soon as administratively feasible following the
Plan Termination Date.

 



 

(h) HopFed shall continue in full force and effect, until the Effective Time:
(i) the fidelity bond, if any, issued to HopFed as described in ERISA Section
412; and (ii) the ERISA fiduciary liability insurance policy currently in
effect, if any, for the benefit of the covered fiduciaries of the HopFed
401(k) Plan.

 



     

 

 



 

5.18 _Disposition of Welfare Benefit and Sec. 125 Plans_.

 



 

(a) All welfare benefit (health, dental/vision, life/ADandD, LTD), and Internal
Revenue Code Section 125, or "cafeteria," plans currently sponsored by HopFed
or Heritage Bank shall be terminated as of the Effective Time, unless First
Financial determines that any such plan shall be continued past the Effective
Time. HopFed shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to
terminate all of HopFeds and any Subsidiarys group insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, unless otherwise instructed by First Financial.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable
law, HopFed shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to assign
any and all applicable group insurance policies for any HopFed plans to First
Financial and to provide First Financial all necessary financial, enrollment,
eligibility, contractual, and other information related to its welfare benefit
and cafeteria plans to assist First Financial in the administration of such
plans, unless First Financial has determined that any or all of the group
insurance policies should be terminated as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, HopFed shall
continue to: (i) pay the applicable insurance premiums necessary to continue
the benefits under HopFeds insured welfare benefit plans; (ii) contribute to
the cafeteria plan the pre-tax amounts which the cafeteria plan participants
elect to defer from their compensation; and (iii) pay all eligible claims
incurred, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan, under the
cafeteria plans health and dependent care flexible spending accounts prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

5.19 _Bank Merger_. Prior to the Effective Time, HopFed shall, and cause
Heritage Bank to, cooperate with First Financial and take such action as
reasonably requested by First Financial and necessary to merge Heritage Bank
with and into First Financial Bank immediately subsequent to the Effective
Time.

 



 

5.20 _Cooperation on Conversion of Systems_. HopFed agrees to commence
immediately after the date of this Agreement (and continue until Closing or
completed) using its reasonable best efforts to ensure an orderly transfer of
information, processes, systems, and data to First Financial and to otherwise
assist First Financial in facilitating the conversion of all of HopFeds
systems into, or to conform with, First Financials systems (including
cooperating with First Financial in the training of HopFeds and its
Subsidiaries employees on First Financials systems), so that, as of the
Closing, the systems of HopFed are readily convertible to First Financials
systems to the fullest extent possible without actually converting them prior
to the Closing. HopFed and First Financial shall meet on a regular basis to
discuss and plan for the conversion of HopFeds data processing and related
electronic informational systems to those used by First Financial,

 



     

 

 



 

which planning shall include, without limitation: (i) discussion of possible
termination by HopFed of third-party service provider arrangements effective
at or following the Effective Time; (ii) non-renewal of personal property
leases and software licenses used by HopFed in connection with its systems
operations; and (iii) retention of outside consultants and additional
employees to assist with the conversion and outsourcing, as appropriate, of
proprietary or self-provided system services.

 



 

5.21 _Installation/Conversion of Equipment_. Prior to Closing, at times
mutually agreeable to First Financial and HopFed, First Financial may, at
First Financials sole expense, install teller equipment, platform equipment,
security equipment, and computers, at the HopFed and Heritage Bank offices,
branches, and ATM locations, and HopFed shall cooperate with First Financial
in connection with such installation; provided, however, that such
installations shall not interfere with the normal business activities and
operations of HopFed or Heritage Bank or require material alterations to
HopFeds or Heritage Banks facilities.

 



 

5.22 _Termination of Contracts._ HopFed shall cooperate with First Financial
to determine which contracts, agreements or arrangements will not be retained
by First Financial and will be terminated, in addition to terminating the Data
Processing Agreement as defined and described in Section 7.2(e) (collectively,
the " _Terminated Contracts_ "). HopFed shall promptly give notice and take
all other appropriate actions to terminate the Terminated Contracts and to
determine any and all termination costs, including without limitation, early
termination fees, penalties and recaptures of discounts.

 



 

5.23 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, HopFed and First
Financial shall take all such steps as may be required or appropriate to cause
the contemplated transactions, and any other dispositions of equity
securities of HopFed or acquisitions of equity securities of First Financial
in connection with the consummation of the contemplated transactions, by each
director or officer of HopFed who becomes subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended ("Exchange Act") with respect to First Financial to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. HopFed shall promptly furnish
First Financial with all requisite information necessary for First Financial
to take the actions contemplated by this Section, which information shall be
accurate in all material respects.

 



 

ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 



 

First Financial covenants and agrees with HopFed and covenants and agrees to
cause its Subsidiaries to act as follows (and HopFed covenants and agrees with
First Financial as follows):

 



 

6.1 _Approvals_. First Financial shall have primary responsibility for the
preparation, filing, and costs of all bank regulatory applications required
for consummation of the Merger, and all parties shall file such applications
as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement not to exceed
60 days. First Financial

 



     

 

 



 

and HopFed shall provide to the others counsel copies of all applications
filed and copies of all material written communications with all Regulatory
Agencies relating to such applications. First Financial and HopFed shall
cooperate fully and use commercially reasonable efforts to procure, upon terms
and conditions reasonably acceptable to each of them, all consents,
authorizations, approvals, registrations, and certificates, to complete all
filings and applications, and to satisfy all other requirements prescribed by
law which are necessary for consummation of the Merger on the terms and
conditions provided in this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the "
_Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals from (x) the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve, the OCC, and the KDFI and (y) any other approvals set forth in
Sections 3.4 and 4.4 which are necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or
those the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.2 _SEC Registration_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, HopFed (with
the assistance of First Financial as appropriate) shall prepare the Proxy
Statement, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, to be used
in connection with the HopFed Shareholders Meeting or approval for the
Merger, and First Financial shall prepare and file with the SEC the S-4
covering the shares of First Financial Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement and containing the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be used for
the HopFed Shareholders Meeting, as applicable. First Financial shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the same to become effective and thereafter,
until the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, to keep the same
effective and, if necessary, amend and supplement the same. First Financial
shall, as soon as practicable after filing the S-4 (but not to exceed 75
days), make all filings required to obtain all blue sky exemptions,
authorizations, consents, or approvals required for the issuance of First
Financial Common Stock.

 



 

(b) The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to respond (with the
assistance of the other party) as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the S-4. If prior to the Effective Time any event
occurs with respect to HopFed, First Financial, or any Subsidiary of HopFed or
First Financial, respectively, or any change occurs with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of HopFed or First Financial,
respectively, for inclusion in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 that,
in each case, is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4, HopFed or First Financial, as
applicable, shall promptly notify the other of such event, and HopFed or First
Financial, as applicable, shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment or supplement to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and
the S-4 and, as required by

 



      

 

 



 

applicable law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to HopFeds shareholders.

 



 

(c) First Financial will use reasonable best efforts to list for trading on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market (subject to official notice of issuance) prior
to the Effective Time, the shares of First Financial Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger.

 



 

6.3 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, First
Financial will take action necessary to permit Continuing Employees to enter
the First Financial Corporation 401(k) Plan (the "First Financial 401(k)
Plan") as of the Effective Time. Continuing Employees will be credited with
prior years of service with HopFed for purposes of eligibility and vesting
(but not benefit accruals). First Financial agrees to permit HopFed Bank
401(k) Plan participants who become employees of First Financial to roll over
their account balances in the HopFed 401(k) Plan to the First Financial 401(k)
Plan, subject to the terms of the First Financial 401(k) Plan, including any
rollover restrictions.

 



 

(b) To the extent HopFeds health and welfare plans are terminated pursuant to
Section 5.19 and Continuing Employees become participants in First Financials
health and welfare plans, First Financial shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such employees and their eligible dependents under any First Financial plans,
except to the extent such pre-existing condition exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the analogous HopFed Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such
employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a HopFed Benefit Plan (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous HopFed Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with HopFed and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate and vesting (and with respect to paid
time off and vacation plans, benefits level determination) in any First
Financial plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account
under the analogous HopFed Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided
that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B)
for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, including the First
Financial Corporation Employees Pension Plan, or benefit plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any First Financial benefit plan that is a
frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to

 



     

 

 



 

continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, HopFed, First
Financial, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, HopFed, First
Financial, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate
the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of HopFed or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any HopFed Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular HopFed Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including without limitation any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of HopFed or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

6.4 _Adverse Actions_. First Financial shall not knowingly take any action
that is intended or is reasonably likely to result in (a) any of its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming
untrue in any respect at any time at or prior to the Effective Time, (b) any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied,
or (c) a material violation of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _D andO Insurance and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, First
Financial agrees that all rights to indemnification (including rights to
advancement of expenses) provided for in the respective HopFed Articles or
Bylaws, or required under any applicable Law, in each case as in effect on the
date hereof, will survive the Merger and will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the present and former directors and officers of HopFed and
Heritage Bank (each, an "Indemnified Party") for acts or omissions occurring
or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.05, First Financial shall
not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Indemnified Party to
a greater extent than either HopFed or Heritage Bank could, as of the date of
this Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless such Indemnified Party,
and indemnification shall only be provided to the extent it is permitted by
any applicable federal or state laws.

 



 

(b) _Provided_ HopFed has historically carried directors and officers
liability insurance, First Financial shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the persons serving as officers and directors of HopFed and Heritage
Bank

 



     

 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy currently maintained by HopFed (the "Existing Policy") or by
a comparable or better policy (the "Replacement Policy"). Prior to the
Effective Time, as instructed by First Financial, HopFed shall cause the
applicable broker of record for its Existing Policy and its Financial
Institution Bond (or similar policy) to be assigned to First Financials
designee. Such assignments in favor of First Financials designee shall be
executed by HopFed with sufficient time to allow First Financial and its
designee to place the insurance required by this Section. The Existing Policy
or Replacement Policy, subject to policy terms and conditions, shall provide
coverage with respect to covered acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that First Financial shall not be required
to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any Replacement Policy)
in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium for the current
annual term of the Existing Policy (the "Maximum Amount"); and, provided,
further, however, that, if notwithstanding the use of reasonable efforts to do
so, First Financial is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for
by this Section 6.5(b), First Financial shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. First Financials
obligations within this Section 6.5(b) apply solely and exclusively to the
Existing Policy and the existing Financial Institution Bond at each policys
current limits of insurance, as well as its other terms, conditions,
exclusions and annual premiums as of the date of this Agreement, and which
must be continuously maintained in force by HopFed without interruption,
cancellation, or amendment until the Effective Time or First Financials
obligations within this Section shall cease.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6\. 5 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and personal representatives.

 



 

(d) In the event that either First Financial or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of First Financial shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.5.

 



 

(e) The following provisions shall apply to any challenge or litigation
brought against HopFed, its Subsidiaries, or their respective employees,
officers and directors with respect to the execution and/or consummation of
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement issued in connection with the proposed transactions ("Transaction
Litigation"):

 



     

 

 



 

(i) At all times before the Closing, HopFed shall keep First Financial fully
informed about the conduct of any Transaction Litigation and shall not settle
any such Transaction Litigation without First Financials advance written
consent.

 



 

(ii) Should Transaction Litigation continue or be initiated after the Closing,
First Financial shall have the sole right to control the defense of the
Transaction Litigation, including the right to settle any such litigation
without consent from any HopFed or Heritage Bank employees, officers or
directors who are defendants, so long as such settlement does not, with
respect to any such defendants, (1) involve an admission of fault or personal
liability, (2) impose any legal restrictions on such defendants future
conduct, or (3) require payment of any amount in settlement.

 



 

6.6 _Changes and Supplements to First Financial Disclosure Schedules_. First
Financial shall promptly supplement, amend, and update, upon the occurrence of
any change prior to the Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the
First Financial Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matters or events
hereafter arising which, if in existence or having occurred as of the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
First Financial Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement and including, without
limitation, any fact which, if existing or known as of the date hereof, would
have made any of the representations or warranties of First Financial
contained herein materially incorrect, untrue or misleading. No such
supplement, amendment, or update shall have any effect for the purposes of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII or become
part of the First Financial Disclosure Schedule unless HopFed shall have first
consented in writing with respect thereof.

 



 

6.7 _Trust Preferred Securities_. At the Effective Time, First Financial shall

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of HopFed:

 



 

(a) by mutual consent of First Financial and HopFed in a written instrument
signed by each of HopFed and First Financial, if the Board of Directors of
each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board;

 



 

(b) by either the Board of Directors of First Financial or the Board of
Directors of HopFed by written notice to the other party if any Governmental
Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and such denial has
become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(c) by either the Board of Directors of First Financial or the Board of
Directors of HopFed by written notice to the other party if the Merger shall
not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2019 (the " _Termination
Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due
to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(d) by either the Board of Directors of First Financial or the Board of
Directors of HopFed by written notice to the other party ( _provided_ , that

been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of HopFed, in the
case of a termination by First Financial, or First Financial, in the case of a
termination by HopFed, which breach or failure to be true, either individually
or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by First Financial, or 7.3, in the
case of a termination by HopFed, and which is not cured within forty-five (45)
calendar days following written notice to HopFed, in the case of a termination
by First Financial, or First Financial, in the case of a termination

 



      

 

 



 

by HopFed, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or
such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

 



 

(e) by either First Financial or HopFed by written notice to the other party
if the Board of Directors of HopFed shall have (i) failed to recommend in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement that the shareholders of HopFed adopt this
Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner
adverse to First Financial, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within three (3) calendar days after First Financial requests
in writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against
acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding HopFed Common
Stock that has been publicly disclosed (other than by First Financial or an
affiliate of First Financial) within ten (10) business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer, in any such case whether or not
permitted by the terms hereof, (ii) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) if the HopFed shareholders vote but fail to approve this
Agreement at the HopFed Shareholders Meeting, provided that in the case of
termination by HopFed, it has complied with its obligations under Section 5.1
and Section 5.6;

 



 

(f) by First Financial by written notice to HopFed if HopFed has breached its
obligations under Section 5.1 or Section 5.6 in any material respect;

 



 

(g) by the Board of Directors of HopFed by written notice to First Financial,
at any time prior to the HopFed shareholder approval being obtained, in the
event that the Board of Directors of HopFed shall concludes, in good faith
after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that it must agree
to endorse a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties, provided that HopFed has complied with all of its
obligations under Section 5.1(b) and Section 5.6; or

 



 

(h) by the Board of Directors of HopFed by written notice to First Financial
if both of the following conditions requisite to termination under this
Section 8.1(h) are satisfied at any time during the seven (7) calendar day
period commencing on the Determination Date, such termination to be effective

First Financial Market Value; and

 



 

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the then First Financial Market Value by
the Initial First Financial Market Value shall be less than the Index Ratio,
_minus_ 0.20.

and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such company
shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section
8.1(h).

 



 

The termination right under this Section 8.1(h) is subject, however, to the
following: If HopFed elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
Section 8.1(h), it shall give prompt written notice thereof to First
Financial. During the seven (7) calendar day period commencing upon its
receipt of such notice, First Financial shall have the option to increase the
Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (x) a quotient, the numerator of which
is equal to the product of the Initial First Financial Market Value, the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.20 and the
denominator of which is equal to the then First Financial Market Value; or (y)
the quotient determined by dividing the Initial First Financial Market Value
by the then First Financial Market Value, and multiplying the quotient by the
product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If within such
seven (7) calendar day period, First Financial delivers written notice to
HopFed that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies HopFed
of the revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) as if no written notice of termination had
been given, and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio shall have been so
modified).

meanings indicated below:

 



 

(iii) " _Determination Date_ " shall mean the latest of (i) the date on which

period); or (ii) the date on which the shareholder approval of HopFed has been
received.

 



 

(iv) " _Final Index Price"_ means the average of the daily closing value of
the Index for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the Determination Date.

NASDAQ Bank Index.

 



 

(vi) " _Index Ratio"_ means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index
Price.

 



 

(vii) " _Initial First Financial Market Value"_ means $41.29, adjusted as
indicated above.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either First Financial or
HopFed as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of First Financial, HopFed, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 5.10(c)
and this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.1) shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither First Financial nor HopFed shall
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of HopFed or has been made directly to
its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and
not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to HopFed and (A) (1)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either First Financial or HopFed
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and HopFed shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite HopFed Vote or (2) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by First
Financial pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (B) prior to the date that is twelve
(12) months after the date of such termination, HopFed enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then HopFed shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay First Financial, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $5.1 million (the " _Termination Fee_ "); provided, that for purposes
of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(i), Section 8.1(e)(ii), Section 8.1(f), or Section 8.1(g), then HopFed
shall pay First Financial, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination
Fee on the date of termination.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1, the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by
HopFed under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee.

 



 

(d) Each of First Financial and HopFed acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if HopFed fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, First Financial commences a suit which results in a
judgment against HopFed for the Termination Fee, HopFed shall pay the costs
and expenses of First Financial (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if HopFed fails to pay the amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then HopFed shall pay interest on such
overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by
JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which
such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

 



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of HopFed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of HopFed, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval
under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



     

 

 



 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may by written agreement or otherwise in writing, to the extent legally
allowed, extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and waive compliance with any of the agreements or
satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after adoption of this Agreement by the respective shareholders of HopFed,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any extension
or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further
approval under applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.
