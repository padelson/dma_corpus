final and binding upon both Parties and shall be deemed to constitute the
Completion Statement. The Purchaser shall during normal business hours provide

Companies books and records for the purpose of preparing the Vendors
completion statement. The Vendor and its accountants shall be permitted to
copy such of the Group Companies books and records as the Vendor may deem

The auditors fees, costs and expenses shall be borne equally by the Parties
and each Party shall bear its own costs. Should the dispute concern an amount
equal to or in excess of SEK 30,000,000 then either Party may instead refer
the dispute and the determination of the Completion Statement to arbitration
pursuant to Section 18 below. 
---|--- 



   3.4 | Immediately upon the expiration of the thirty (30) Business Day
period in which the Purchaser may object to the Vendors completion statement,

immediately upon the resolution of a dispute under Section 3.3 or Section 18,
if any, the Final Purchase Price shall be determined by adjusting the
Preliminary Purchase Price as follows:  
---|--- 

(i) If the amount of Cash in SEK on the Completion Date as shown in the
Completion Statement is less than the Estimated Cash in SEK, the difference
shall be paid to the Purchaser; if the amount of Cash in SEK on the Completion
Date as shown in the Completion Statement is greater than the Estimated Cash
in SEK, the difference shall be paid to the Vendor;



 

11 (ii) If the amount of Debt in SEK on Completion Date as shown in the
Completion Statement is greater than the Estimated Debt, the difference shall
be paid to the Purchaser; and

(iii) If the Working Capital in SEK on the Completion Date as shown in the
Completion Statement is less than the Estimated Working Capital in SEK, the
difference shall be paid to the Purchaser; if the Working Capital in SEK on
the Completion Date as shown in the Completion Statement is greater than
the Estimated Working Capital in SEK, the difference shall be paid to the
Vendor.

The net of (i), (ii) and (iii) above in SEK shall be converted to Euros at
the Exchange Rate in effect on the Completion Date and paid immediately to the
Vendor or Purchaser, as the case may be, together with interest for the actual
number of days elapsed from the Completion Date to the date of payment
calculated at EURIBOR 90 days (as quoted on the Completion Date) for the
actual number of days elapsed from the Completion Date to the date of payment,
net of any required tax withholding.



   

3.5

 |

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that on or before the Completion
Date the Vendor (i) shall cause the Group Companies and Vendors other

---|--- 



   4.1 | The obligations of the Vendor and the Purchaser to complete the
purchase of the Shares under this Agreement are conditional upon the obtaining
of clearance (including the expiration of applicable waiting periods without
pending or threatened further proceedings) or a decision not to take further
action from all the relevant competition authorities, and/or such other
authorities as may be relevant to the sale of the Shares.  
---|--- 



   4.2 |

The Purchaser will use all reasonable endeavours to fulfil or procure the
fulfilment of the condition set out in Section 4.1 above (e.g. by filing
its application with the   

---|--- 



 

12  EU Commission within one month after the date of this Agreement, assuming
due cooperation by the Vendor) and will notify the Vendor in writing,
immediately after it becomes aware of the satisfaction of such condition. 

---|--- 



   4.3 | In the event the relevant competition or other authorities would
not be prepared to give their clearance to the sale and purchase of Shares
contemplated herein, the Purchaser undertakes to negotiate in good faith with
the relevant authorities and, as the case may be, with the Vendor, in order to
obtain timely clearance and to take any reasonable measures required by the
authorities so that the said sale and purchase will not be prohibited or
restricted in any material way. Such measures shall not entitle the Purchaser
to any compensation of any kind from the Vendor. The Vendor shall be given the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations with such authorities.  
---|---

---|--- 



   5.1 | Completion shall take place, unless otherwise agreed in writing

waived (the "Completion Date").

foregoing, if Vendor fails to comply with its obligations in Section 5.2(v),
the Purchaser  



 

13  shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement or arrange a new date for
Completion, unless the Vendors failure results in the senior debt
and working capital facilities of the Purchaser for the transaction not being
available in full at and after Completion. For purposes of the foregoing, the
Vendor shall be permitted to take such actions (including providing
indemnities) as may be requested by the senior lender to make such debt and

the same terms as the loan or part of loan not made, in which case the
Purchaser shall be required to complete the purchase of the Shares;

(vii) deliver a waiver and release of all liabilities of the Company to

for Alberto-Culver provided benefits.

meeting and a board meeting to be held in the Company allowing the Purchaser
to appoint new directors and deputy directors and to appoint company
signatories. 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall prepare the minutes of said meetings as well as
the necessary ancillary documentation, and the Purchaser shall procure that
the documentation, immediately following said meetings, is submitted to the
Swedish Companies Registration Office and procure confirmation of receipt of
such submission as soon as reasonably practible. The Purchaser shall submit
all draft minutes and necessary ancillary documentation referred to in this
Section 5.4 to Advokatfirman Hammarskiold and Co for their approval and
agreement at least three (3) Business Days prior to Completion.

5.3 or 5.4, or if the Vendor fails to comply with its obligations in Section
5.2, the Purchaser, in the case of non-compliance by the Vendor, or the
Vendor, in the case of non-compliance by the Purchaser, shall be entitled (in
addition to, and without prejudice to, all other rights or remedies available
to such Party, including the right to claim damages) by written notice to the
other; 
---|--- 

(i) to terminate the Agreement (other than the Surviving Sections)
without liability on its part; or



 

14 (ii) to arrange a new date for Completion (not being more than twenty (20)
Business Days after the agreed date of Completion) in which case the
provisions of Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 shall apply to Completion as so
deferred, provided such deferral may only occur once. If Completion is
deferred as a consequence of the Purchasers failure to comply with an
obligation in Section 5.3 or 5.4, the Purchase Price shall be increased with
interest from the scheduled Completion Date up to and including the date when
completion actually occurs, at a rate of eight (8) percent per annum. 



   5.6 | If Completion has not occurred on or before the day occurring
nine calendar months from Signing Date as a result of the absence of

powers to carry on its business as currently conducted. 
---|--- 



   8.2 | The Purchaser is neither prohibited nor restrained by its by-
laws, articles of association or any similar document, or by any agreements to
which it is a party, from entering into this Agreement and any other
agreements or documents to be executed by the Purchaser pursuant to or in

other agreements and documents to be executed by the Purchaser pursuant to or
in connection with this Agreement when executed will be, the binding
obligations of the Purchaser in accordance with its and their respective
terms. 
---|--- 



   8.3 | The execution of this Agreement and the performance by the
Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement and under any other
agreements or documents to be executed by the Purchaser pursuant to or in

any order, judgment or decree of any court, governmental agency or regulatory

Sections 2.2 and 5.2(i) hereof and in the case of fraud and grossly negligent
concealment, (i) the provisions of this Section 9 are intended to and shall
operate to limit the liability of the Vendor in respect of any claim under or
in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Warranties), and (ii) subject to the conditions and limitations set out below
in this Section 9, the Vendor shall be liable to the Purchaser only in respect
of a Deficiency.

shall constitute a reduction of the Final Purchase Price in an amount
corresponding to the amount of the Deficiency, Euro-for-Euro, subject to the
provisions of this Section 9\. Claims denominated in SEK shall be converted to
Euros on the date on which the Deficiency is paid or incurred by the Purchaser
at the "spot" exchange rate for the conversion of SEK to Euros published by
Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ) on such date. 
---|--- 



   9.1.3 | The remedy for Claims provided to the Purchaser under this
Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser and it is
specifically agreed that the Vendor shall have no other liability in respect
of this Agreement and the sale and transfer of the Shares, including any
liability under any statute including the Swedish Sale of Goods Act (Sw. _K
oplagen (1990:931)_). 
---|--- 


   9.1.4 | For the avoidance of doubt, the Vendor shall have no liability
to the Purchaser in respect of any indirect or consequential loss suffered by
the Purchaser, including, without limitation, loss of profits or revenues,
loss of synergies or advantages, or loss of any other similar benefit that the
Purchaser, the Group Companies or the Purchasers Affiliates may expect to
obtain from the purchase of the Shares. In respect of Group Companies, the
Vendor shall have no liability for consequential loss. 
---|--- 



   9.1.5 | Upon any Claim being made against the Vendor, the Purchaser
shall and shall procure that each Group Company shall make available to the
Vendor and the Vendors advisers such access to its personnel and to any
relevant records and information as the Vendor may reasonably request in
connection with such Claim. 
---|--- 



   9.1.6 | The Warranties shall survive the Completion Date for a period
of nine months and no Claim shall be filed after the expiration of said nine
month period, provided that the Warranties contained herein relating to
capitalization, ownership and title shall survive for a period five years and
the Warranties contained in Sections 7.16-17 (Taxes) shall survive for a
period of three months following the expiration of applicable statutes of
limitation. 
---|--- 



 

22 ---|--- 



   9.2.1 | Notice of a Claim must be (i) given to the Vendor in writing
within the time provided in Section 9.1.6, (ii) accompanied by reasonable
particulars thereof specifying the nature of the Claim and, so far as
practicable, the amount of the Deficiency and (iii) given not more than thirty
(30) days after the date the Purchaser became aware of the circumstances
giving rise to the Claim, and not more than fifteen (15) days after the date
the Purchaser became aware of the circumstances giving rise to the Claim in
case it relates to Tax. 
---|--- 



   9.2.2 | No liability shall attach to the Vendor in respect of any Claim
to the extent that the Claim is based on a liability which is contingent only,
or is otherwise not capable of being quantified, unless and until such
liability ceases to be contingent and becomes an actual liability or becomes
capable of being quantified, as the case may be. 
---|--- 


   9.2.3 | In order to constitute a valid Claim, the Deficiency on which
the Claim is based must be in an amount greater than Euro 250,000 (a "Valid
Claim"). No Valid Claim(s) shall be payable by the Vendor to the Purchaser
unless and until the aggregate of the Valid Claim(s) is in excess of Euro
2,500,000 and, in such event, the Vendor shall be liable to the Purchaser only
for the amount by which the total Valid Claim(s) exceed the amount of Euro
2,500,000. The foregoing limitations shall not apply in respect to any Claim
for breach of the Warranties contained in Sections 7.1.1-7.1.3. 
---|--- 


   9.2.4 | The Vendor shall have the right to cure fully or partially a
breach of a Warranty within 60 days of its receipt of a notice of a Claim and
such full or partial cure shall mitigate any amount payable to the Purchaser
in respect of the Claim. If a Claim has not been satisfied, settled or
withdrawn within six months after the date the Purchaser first gave notice of
such Claim, it shall be deemed to have been irrevocably withdrawn unless
legal proceedings in respect of the Claim have been formally commenced and
served upon the Vendor within such six month period. 
---|--- 



   9.2.5 | The Vendors total liability to the Purchaser under or in
connection with this Agreement shall under no circumstances exceed an amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of the Final Purchase Price. The foregoing
limitation shall not apply in respect to any Claim for breach of the
Warranties contained in Sections 7.1.1-7.1.3, and in that case, the total
liability to the Purchaser shall instead be limited to the Final Purchase
Price. 
---|--- 



   9.2.6 | No Claim, Deficiency or other liability shall arise in respect
of any breach of the Warranties: 
---|--- 
(i) if and to the extent that a Deficiency arises as a result of any
legislation not in force at the Signing Date, or which takes effect
retroactively, or occurs as a result of any increase in the rate of Tax in
force at the Signing Date or any change in the practice of the relevant Tax
Authority;



 

23 (ii) if and to the extent that a Deficiency arises after the Completion Date
as a result of any change in the generally accepted interpretation or
application of any legislation;

(iii) if and to the extent that a Deficiency would not have arisen but for an
act, omission or transaction carried out (a) at the request or with the
consent of the Purchaser prior to Completion or which is expressly authorised
by this Agreement, or (b) by, at the request of or with the consent of the
Purchaser, or persons deriving authority from the Purchaser, after Completion;

(iv) if and to the extent that the Deficiency is recoverable by the Purchaser
or any Group Company under any policy of insurance or would have been
recoverable under a policy of insurance in force on or before the Completion
Date, and such policy or coverage has been cancelled, lapsed or
not substituted or replaced by the Purchaser or a Group Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser acknowledges that the Group Companies are
covered by the Vendors global insurance polices which will not cover any
Group Company or the Purchaser after Completion;

(v) to the extent that allowance, provision or reserve in respect of the
matter or thing giving rise to such Claim, Deficiency or other liability has
been made in the Accounts on the Completion Date.



   9.2.7 | In the event a Deficiency arises or increases because of the
whole or partial loss of a Tax deduction or if a Deficiency has any effect on
the Companys Tax returns or Tax position, then (i) to the extent the
Deficiency provides a Tax deduction or other benefit to any Group Company, the
amount of the Deficiency shall be reduced Euro-for-Euro by an amount equal to
such benefit and (ii), if the Company has a right to a Tax deduction related
to the Deficiency in any other Tax period, the Deficiency shall be further
reduced by an amount equal to the present value of such deduction, discounted
at 8% per annum, with any such adjustment made at the rate of Tax in effect
on the Completion Date. 
---|--- 



   9.2.8 | No Deficiency shall exist and no Claim shall be made (i) based
on facts or circumstances identified, contained or disclosed in this Agreement
or in the written Disclosure Materials (disclosed in such manner so as the
make the relevance thereof to a particular Warranty reasonably apparent), or
(ii) which Claim was otherwise known to the Purchaser or any of its advisers
on or prior to the Completion Date.  
---|--- 



   9.2.9 |

The Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken and all
reasonable assistance is given to mitigate the amount of any damage, third
party claim, loss,   

---|--- 



 

24  cost or expense which in the absence of such steps of assistance or
mitigation would or could give rise to or increase the amount of a Deficiency,
including the giving of timely and proper notice to the relevant insurance
company. 

---|--- 



   

9.2.10

 |

If the Vendor has made any payment to the Purchaser in discharge of any Claim
or 3rd Party Claim or Demand as the case may be, and subsequent thereto the
Purchaser or any Group Company has the right to recover from any third party
any amount which indemnifies or compensates the Purchaser or any Group
Company (in whole or in part) in respect of the Deficiency which is the
subject matter of the Claim or 3rd Party Claim or Demand as the case may be,
then the Purchaser shall inform the Vendor thereof and, upon request of the
Vendor, either assign that right to the Vendor or, if the Vendor so directs,
the Purchaser or the Group Company shall at the discretion and cost of the
Vendor, pursue the said right of recovery and account to the Vendor for any
monies or other property recovered. 

---|--- 



   9.2.11 | The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover from the Vendor
under this Agreement more than once in respect of the same Claim or
Deficiency. 
---|--- 


   9.2.12 | The amount of any Deficiency shall, prior to reimbursement of
the corresponding Claim by the Vendor, first be offset by the value of the
benefit, if any, that accrues to any Group Company as a result of such
Deficiency. 
---|--- 



   9.2.13 | The provisions of this Section 9 apply notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement and will not be discharged or cease to have
effect in consequence of any termination of any other provisions of this
Agreement. 
---|--- 



   9.2.14 | The Purchaser hereby waives and relinquishes any right of set-
off or counterclaim, deduction or retention which the Purchaser might
otherwise have in respect of any payments that the Purchaser may be obliged
to make (or procure to be made) to the Vendor pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise. 
---|--- 



   9.3 | Third party claims 
---|--- 



   

9.3.1

 |

In case the Purchaser becomes aware of a possible claim or demand by a third-
party, whether or not formally asserted (a "3rd Party Claim or Demand") that
may give rise to a Deficiency, the Purchaser shall:   

---|--- 

(i) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after the date the Purchaser became aware of circumstances giving rise to
a 3rd Party Claim or Demand, give notice thereof to the Vendor;

(ii) take such action as the Vendor may reasonably request, including the
institution of proceedings and the instruction of counsel and other advisers
reasonably acceptable to the Vendor to act on behalf of the Purchaser or the
relevant Group Company, to avoid any dispute, or resist, appeal, compromise or
defend such 3rd Party Claim or Demand, with the proviso, however, that the
Purchaser shall not make any admission of liability,  



 

25  accept, pay, compromise, settle or make any submission in respect of such
3rd Party Claim or Demand without the Vendors prior written consent thereto;
and

(iii) give the Vendor or the Vendors duly authorised representatives all such
information and assistance as the Vendor may reasonably request as well as
reasonable access to the personnel of the Purchaser and/or the Company, as
the case may be, and to any relevant premises, accounts, documents and records
within their respective power or control, to enable the Vendor, or the
Vendors duly authorised representatives, to examine such 3rd Party Claim or
Demand, and the premises, accounts, documents and records related thereto, and
to take copies or photocopies thereof at the Vendors expense.



   

9.3.2

 |

No liability shall attach to the Vendor to the extent that a 3rd  Party Claim
or Demand has arisen or the amount of the 3rd Party Claim or Demand has been
increased because the Purchaser failed to comply with Section 9.3.1. 

---|--- 



   

9.4

 |

3rd Party Claims or Demands denominated in SEK shall be converted to Euro at
the exchange rate in effect on the date the claim arose, but not before the
Completion Date, or in the event the Purchaser or a Group Company makes a
payment to a 3rd party, the date on which such payment is made. 

---|--- 



   9.5 | Should the Disclosure Letter contain Deficiencies which in the
aggregate amount to more than Euro 2,500,000, the Vendor shall either on
Completion undertake to reimburse the Purchaser for the amount in excess of
Euro 2,500,000, or failing such undertaking, the Purchaser shall have the
right to rescind the Agreement at Completion, without liability on its part.
If the Purchaser does not rescind but elects to complete the purchase of the
Shares, the Purchaser shall have waived all rights under Section 9 relating to
such deficiencies. For the avoidance of doubt, the Vendor shall have no
obligation to reimburse the Purchaser should the aggregate amount
of Deficiencies not exceed Euro 2,500,000. For the avoidance of doubt none of
the provisions of Section 9, including 9.2.13, shall apply to this Section
9.5.

respectively, shall bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection

Agreement or any other information, whether written or oral, including,
