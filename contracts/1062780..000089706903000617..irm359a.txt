     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 3, 2003 (this "Agreement"),
among WELLPOINT HEALTH NETWORKS INC., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"),
CROSSROADS ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), and COBALT CORPORATION, a Wisconsin
corporation ("Target").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

     WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Target and Purchaser deem it advisable
and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective stockholders
that Target and Purchaser engage in a business combination in order to advance
the long-term strategic business interests of Target and Purchaser;

     WHEREAS, the combination of Target and Purchaser shall be effected by the
terms of this Agreement through a merger as outlined below (the "Merger");

     WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of
Target and Purchaser have approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each share of common
stock, no par value, of Target (other than the Subsidiary Held Stock (as defined
in Section 3.2(b)) ("Target Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), other than the Target
Treasury Shares (as defined in Section 1.8(a)), and shares of Target Common
Stock owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, will be converted into the right to
receive shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Purchaser
("Purchaser Common Stock") and an amount of cash, each as set forth in Section
1.8;

     WHEREAS, Purchaser and Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc. (the
"Foundation") have entered into a Voting and Lockup Agreement simultaneously
herewith, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of Target for the
purposes of Section 180.1141 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the
"WBCL"); and

     WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement shall qualify as a "plan of
reorganization" as that term is defined under Section 368(a) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (subject to the election provided for in
Section 1.1).

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

     1.1 The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DGCL") and the WBCL, Target shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at the
Effective Time. Immediately

<PAGE>

following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Target shall cease and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") under the name Cobalt Corporation. In lieu of Target being merged
with and into Merger Sub, if all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived other than the conditions set forth
in Section 6.2(c) or 6.3(c) (relating to the receipt of opinions that the Merger
is a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code), Purchaser shall have the
right to irrevocably elect (the "Reverse Merger Election") by notice delivered
to Target, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, to cause the "Merger" to be a merger of Merger Sub with and into
Target at the Effective Time, in which case, following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Target shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation.

          (b) For these purposes, the "continuity of interest" requirement of
Section 368 of the Code shall be deemed satisfied by all parties hereto if the
amount of Total Cash (as defined below) is less than or equal to 55% of the
aggregate of the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 1.8(b)), based on
the average high and low price of Purchaser Common Stock on the day before the
Closing Date. "Total Cash" shall mean the sum of (i) Cash Consideration to be
paid pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(i) hereof, (ii) redemptions of or distributions
with respect to Target Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock in connection with
the Merger that would be treated as "other property" or money for purposes of
Section 356 of the Code, and (iii) repurchases or acquisitions of Purchaser
Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger by Purchaser or certain
parties related to Purchaser (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec.
1.368-1(e)(3)).

     1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the closing of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will
take place on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than any
such conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
which shall be required to be so satisfied or waived on the Closing Date),
unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the
actual time and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, unless another place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.

     1.3 Effective Time. At the Closing, the parties shall (i) file a
certificate or articles of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as
is required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and the WBCL and (ii) make all other filings or recordings required under
the DGCL and the WBCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with both the Secretary of State of Delaware
and the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin or at
such subsequent time as Purchaser and Target shall agree and as shall be
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time").

     1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the DGCL and the WBCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger Sub
shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all

                                       2
<PAGE>

debts, liabilities and duties of Target and Merger Sub shall be the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.5 Certificate of Incorporation. Unless the Reverse Merger Election is
made, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable law. If the Reverse Merger Election is made, the articles of
incorporation of Target as amended in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit 1.5
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

     1.6 By-Laws. At the Effective Time and without any further action on the
part of Target and Merger Sub, the By-Laws of Merger Sub shall be the By-Laws of
the Surviving Corporation and thereafter may be amended or repealed in
accordance with their terms or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and as provided by law. If the Reverse Merger Election is made, the
By-Laws of Target as amended in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit 1.6 shall
be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law.

     1.7 Officers and Directors of Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger
Sub as of the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an
officer or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as
the case may be. The directors of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall
serve as directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

     1.8 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Target
Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock:

          (a) All shares of Target Common Stock that are owned by Target as
treasury stock or otherwise (the "Target Treasury Shares"), Purchaser or Merger
Sub shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no cash,
Purchaser Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

          (b) Each share of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Target Treasury Shares
and shares of Target Common Stock owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub) shall be
converted at the Effective Time into the following (the "Merger Consideration"):

               (i) the right to receive $10.25 in cash (the "Cash
Consideration"); and

               (ii) the right to receive the Exchange Ratio (as defined in
Section 8.11) of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Purchaser Common Stock
(the "Stock Consideration").

                                       3
<PAGE>

Upon such conversion, all such shares of Target Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Target Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash for
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5 upon the surrender of the
Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
unchanged following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation.
In the case of a Reverse Merger, each share of common stock shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (d) Each share of Subsidiary Held Stock shall be converted into the
right to receive two times the Exchange Ratio in Purchaser Common Stock
("Subsidiary Stock Consideration"). Upon such conversion, all such shares of
Subsidiary Held Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Subsidiary Held Stock (a "Subsidiary Held Certificate") shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Subsidiary Stock Consideration and cash for
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5 upon the surrender of the
Subsidiary Held Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof.

     1.9 Target Stock Options. Target and Purchaser shall take all action
reasonably necessary so that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
stock option (the "Target Stock Options") heretofore granted or granted after
the date hereof in compliance with the provisions hereof under any stock option
or similar plan of Target (the "Target Stock Option Plans") and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested and exercisable as
of the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of such Target Stock Options and
shall be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock (a "Converted Option") equal to the product of the number of shares
of Target Common Stock subject to such Target Stock Option multiplied by twice
the Exchange Ratio (provided that any fractional share resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share). The terms and
conditions of the Converted Option shall otherwise remain the same as the terms
and conditions of the Target Stock Option, except that the exercise price per
share of each Converted Option shall equal the exercise price per share of such
Target Stock Option divided by twice the Exchange Ratio (provided that such
exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Purchaser shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted
Options. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
registration of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to the Converted
Options to become effective as part of the Form S-4 or a registration statement
on Form S-8, on the same date as the Form S-4 is declared effective; and,
thereafter, Purchaser shall file one or more registration statements on
appropriate forms with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to
the Converted Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements for so
long as the Converted Options remain outstanding. Target and Purchaser shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Section 1.9

                                       4
<PAGE>

and any other dispositions of Target equity securities (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of Purchaser equity securities (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who (i) is a
director or officer of Target or (ii) at the Effective Time will become a
director or officer of Purchaser to become exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each holder of Converted
Options an appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant to the
Target Stock Option Plan and agreements evidencing the grants of such Converted
Options, after giving effect to the transactions hereunder.

     1.10 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Purchaser Common Stock, Target Common Stock or
Subsidiary Held Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or
dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date
within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Stock
Consideration or Subsidiary Stock Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide to the holders of Target Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

                                   ARTICLE II
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     2.1 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint an
exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the
Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). Purchaser shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Target Common
Stock, at or prior to the Effective Time (a) certificates representing the
Purchaser Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock and (b) cash sufficient to pay the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration. Purchaser agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to
pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and certificates of
Purchaser Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

     2.2 Exchange Procedures. Within five Business Days after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of a Certificate (a) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which
letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Purchaser
may reasonably specify and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i)
one or more shares of Purchaser Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the


                                       5
<PAGE>

aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.8 (after taking into account all shares of Target Common
Stock then held by such holder) and (ii) a check for the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable for the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration or pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Target Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Target, one or more shares of Purchaser Common Stock
evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and a check for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, the cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3, may be issued with respect to such Target Common Stock
to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Target
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

     2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment
date prior to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Purchaser
Common Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

     2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Target Common Stock. All shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Target
Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I
and this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5)
shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Target Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, each Certificate or Subsidiary
Held Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
or the Subsidiary Stock Consideration, as the case may be.

     2.5 No Fractional Shares of Purchaser Common Stock. (a) No certificates or
scrip or shares of Purchaser Common Stock representing fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Subsidiary Held Stock and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the

                                       6
<PAGE>

owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Purchaser or a
holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Target Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Purchaser
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Purchaser Common
Stock multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of Purchaser Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape on the
date of the Effective Time or, if such date is not a Business Day, the Business
Day immediately following the date on which the Effective Time occurs. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so
notify Purchaser, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit
such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

     2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Purchaser or otherwise on the instruction

fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions with respect to

any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will

                                       7

deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Target Common

Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Target Common Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving

the Exchange Agent or Purchaser for any reason shall be converted into the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Target Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3.

                                   ARTICLE III
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     3.1 Representations and Warranties of Purchaser. Except as set forth in the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule delivered by Purchaser to Target prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Purchaser Disclosure Schedule") (each section
of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant to the extent specified therein; provided, however that any fact or
condition disclosed in any section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule in such
a way as to make its relevance to a representation or representations made
elsewhere in this Agreement or information called for by another section of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule readily apparent shall be deemed to be an
exception to such representation or representations or to be disclosed on such
other section of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule

                                       8
<PAGE>

notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto),
Purchaser represents and warrants to Target as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Purchaser and each of
its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.11) is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.11) on Purchaser, and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
so to qualify or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. The copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Purchaser which were previously furnished or made
available to Target are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as
in effect on the date of this Agreement.

          (b) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Purchaser
consists of (i) 300,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock of which
146,415,690 shares were issued and outstanding as of the date hereof and (ii)
50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share, none of which
were outstanding as of the date hereof. Since December 31, 2002 to the date of
this Agreement, there have been no issuances of shares of the capital stock of
Purchaser or any other securities of Purchaser other than issuances of shares
pursuant to options or rights outstanding under the Benefit Plans (as defined in
Section 8.11) of Purchaser. All issued and outstanding shares of the capital
stock of Purchaser are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no class of capital stock is entitled to preemptive rights.
There are outstanding as of the date hereof no options, warrants or other rights
to acquire capital stock from Purchaser other than options, restricted stock and
share equivalents representing in the aggregate the right to purchase no more
than 20,028,673 shares of Purchaser Common Stock. All shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including without limitation all shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Converted Options) will, when issued in
accordance with the terms hereof, have been duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all Liens. As of the date
hereof, there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements
or understandings to which the Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound
relating to the voting of any shares of the capital stock of the Purchaser.

          (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

               (i) Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, the issuance of the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and upon the exercise of the Converted
Options (the "Share Issuance"). The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except as

                                       9
<PAGE>

such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by
general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.

               (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser
does not or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation by Purchaser of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a
material benefit under, or the creation of a Lien on any assets (any such
conflict, violation, default, right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration, loss or creation, is hereinafter referred to as a "Violation")
pursuant to: (A) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
Purchaser or any material Subsidiary of Purchaser or (B) except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, subject
to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below,
any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease, benefit
plan or other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise,
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser, or their respective
properties or assets.

               (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any supranational, national, state,
municipal, local or foreign government, any instrumentality, subdivision, court,
administrative agency or commission or other authority thereof, or any
quasi-governmental or private body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing
or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a "Governmental Entity"),
is required by or with respect to Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser or the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except for those required under or in relation to (A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (B) state
securities or "blue sky" laws, (C) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), (D) the
Exchange Act; (E) the WBCL with respect to the filing of the Certificate of
Merger, (F) rules and regulations of the NYSE, (G) the OCI (as defined in
Section 3.2(s)) and the California Department of Managed Health Care and (H)
such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
and filings the failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required under
or in relation to any of the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are hereinafter
referred to as "Necessary Consents."

          (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

               (i) Purchaser has filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required
to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (collectively, including

is required to file any form, report, registration

                                       10

statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC. None of the Purchaser SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of
such filing), contained or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted or will omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Purchaser SEC Reports, together with
any public announcements in a news release made by Purchaser after the date
hereof, as of the Effective Time will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing
as of the Effective Time, not misleading. Each of the financial statements
(including the related notes) included in the Purchaser SEC Reports presents
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position and
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth
therein, all in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case
of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and recurring
adjustments that were not or are not expected to be material in amount, and the
absence of footnote disclosure. All of such Purchaser SEC Reports, as of their
respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective
Purchaser SEC Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

               (ii) Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports filed prior
to the date hereof, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any
liabilities or obligations (whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise)
that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet
of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in
conformity with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of business or (B) liabilities that would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

          (e) Information Supplied.

               (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the registration

or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and (B) the proxy statement for use relating to the adoption by
the stockholders of Target of this Agreement or any of the amendments or
supplements thereto (collectively, the "Proxy Statement") will, on the date it
is first mailed to Target stockholders or at the time of the Target Stockholders
Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1), contain any untrue statement of a material

The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder.

               (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.2(e), no representation or warranty is made by Purchaser with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 based on
information supplied by Target.

          (f) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

               (i) Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports filed prior
to the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against or
affecting Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser having, or which would
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, nor is
there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity
or arbitrator outstanding against Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser
having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect
on Purchaser.

               (ii) Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports filed prior
to the date of the Agreement and except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries hold
all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Entities necessary for the operation of the businesses of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Purchaser Permits"). Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Purchaser Permits,
except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the businesses of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of, and Purchaser has
not received any notices of violations with respect to, any law, ordinance or
regulation of any Governmental Entity, except for possible violations which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

               (iii) Purchaser is in compliance in all material respects with
all rules and regulations of the BCBSA.

          (g) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Purchaser, by
resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held and
not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, has duly approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the Share Issuance.

expenses will be paid by Purchaser in accordance with Purchaser's agreement with
such firm.

          (i) No Vote Required. No vote or other action of the stockholders of
Purchaser is required by law, Purchaser's certificate or incorporation or

order for Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     3.2 Representations and Warranties of Target. Except as set forth in the
Target Disclosure Schedule delivered by Target to Purchaser prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Target Disclosure Schedule") (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant to the extent specified therein; provided, however that any fact or
condition disclosed in any section of the Target Disclosure Schedule in such a
way as to make its relevance to a representation or representations made
elsewhere in this Agreement or information called for by another section of the
Target Disclosure Schedule readily apparent shall be deemed to be an exception
to such representation or representations or to be disclosed on such other
section of the Target Disclosure Schedule notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross reference thereto), Target represents and warrants to
Purchaser as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

               (i) Each of Target and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing
and in good standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, and is duly qualified and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or
to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Target. The copies of the articles of incorporation and
by-laws of Target which were previously furnished or made available to Purchaser
are true, complete and correct copies of such documents.

               (ii) Section 3.2 of the Target Disclosure Schedule lists all the
Subsidiaries of Target which as of the date of this Agreement are Significant
Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC). All the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable (except to the extent provided by Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the
WBCL) and are owned directly or indirectly by Target, free and clear of all
Liens and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right
to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership
interests). Except as set forth in the Target SEC Reports (as defined in Section
3.2(d)), neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns
any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity, that is or would reasonably be expected to
be material to Target and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          (b) Capital Structure.

as of the date hereof, excluding 7,949,904 shares held of record by Blue Cross &
Blue Shield United of Wisconsin ("BCBSUW"), a wholly owned Subsidiary of Target
(the "Subsidiary Held Stock"), and (B) 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, no
par value per share, none of which are outstanding. Since December 31, 2002,
there have been no issuances of shares of the capital stock of Target or any
other securities of Target other than issuances of shares pursuant to Target
Stock Options under the Target Stock Option Plans. All issued and outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Target are duly authorized, validly issued, fully

or other rights to purchase or receive Target Common Stock granted under the
Target Stock Option Plans or otherwise, the dates of grant and the exercise

               (ii) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Target
having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders may vote are
issued or outstanding.

               (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.2(b), there
are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Target or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound obligating Target or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other voting securities
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating Target or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. There
are no outstanding obligations of Target or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Target or
any of its Subsidiaries.

          (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

               (i) Target has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the adoption of
this Agreement by the Required Target Vote (as defined in Section 3.2(h)). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Target, subject in the case of the consummation
of the Merger to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Target Vote.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Target and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of Target, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors generally or by general equity principles (regardless of whether such


                                       14
<PAGE>

enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

               (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target does
not or will not, as the case may be, and the consummation by Target of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with,
or result in a Violation pursuant to: (A) any provision of the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of Target or any Subsidiary of Target or (B) subject to
obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below,
any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease, benefit
plan or other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise,
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Target or any Subsidiary of Target or their respective properties
or assets.

               (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target or the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except the Necessary
Consents and such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings the failure of which to make or obtain would not

prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required
to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (collectively, including
all exhibits thereto, the "Target SEC Reports"). No Subsidiary of Target is
required to file any form, report, registration statement or prospectus or other
document with the SEC. None of the Target SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained or
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Target SEC Reports and any public announcements made by
Target after the date hereof as of the Effective Time will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances existing as of the Effective Time, not misleading. Each of the
financial statements (including the related notes) included in the Target SEC
Reports presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position and consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Target and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth
therein, all in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case
of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and recurring
adjustments that were not or are not expected to be material in amount, and the
absence of footnote disclosure. All of such Target SEC Reports, as of their
respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective Target
SEC Report), complied as to form in all material

                                       15
<PAGE>

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

               (ii) Except as disclosed in the Target SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, Target and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities
or obligations (whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise) that are of a
nature that would be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet of Target and
its Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP,
other than liabilities that would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

          (e) Reserves. The loss reserves and other actuarial amounts of Target
and its Subsidiaries recorded in their respective financial statements contained
in the Target SEC Reports and all statutory reports as of December 31, 2002 and
March 31, 2003 (i) were determined in accordance with generally accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied (except as otherwise noted in such
financial statements), (ii) were fairly stated in all material respects in
accordance with sound actuarial principles, (iii) satisfied all applicable laws
and the requirements of the BCBSA in all material respects and have been
computed on the basis of methodologies consistent with those used in computing
the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years and (iv) include provisions
for all actuarial reserves and related items which ought to be established in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations and prudent insurance practices.
Target is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would necessitate, in
the good faith application of prudent reserving practices and policies, any
material adverse change in the statutorily required reserves or reserves above
those reflected in the most recent balance sheet (other than increases
consistent with past experience resulting from increases in enrollment with
respect to services provided by the Target or its Subsidiaries). The capital and
surplus for Target on a consolidated basis is now, and immediately prior to the
Closing will be, not less than 200% of the authorized control level as defined
in NAIC Risk-Based Capital Guidelines required by applicable law.

          (f) Information Supplied.

               (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Target
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and (B) the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed
to Target stockholders or at the time of the Target Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

               (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.2(f), no representation or warranty is made by Target with respect to
statements made

                                       16

or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement based on
information supplied by Purchaser or Merger Sub.

          (g) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Target, by resolutions
duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, has duly approved this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting
and Lockup Agreement referred to in the fourth Whereas clause hereof and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including without limitation, for
purposes of Section 180.1141 of the WBCL. Such approval is sufficient to render
inapplicable the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section
180.1141(1) of the WBCL to all such transactions and is sufficient to satisfy
Section 180.1141(2)(a) with respect to future business combinations to which
such Section would apply. Other than Section 180.1141 of the WBCL, no takeover
statute or other similar statute is applicable to the Merger, the Voting and
Lockup Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

          (h) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Target Common Stock to approve the Merger (the
"Required Target Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Target capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

          (i) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

               (i) Except as disclosed in the Target SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened, against or
affecting Target or any Subsidiary of Target having, or which would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against Target or any Subsidiary of Target having, or
which reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

               (ii) Except as disclosed in the Target SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement and except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, Target and its Subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Entities necessary for the operation of the businesses of Target
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Target Permits"). Target and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Target Permits, except
where the failure so to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Target. Except as disclosed in the Target SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the businesses of Target and its
Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of, and Target has not
received any notices of violations with respect to, any law, ordinance or
regulation of any Governmental Entity, except for possible violations which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

               (iii) The Target and each of its officers and directors are in
compliance with, and have complied, in all material respects with (A) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations promulgated under such act or the Exchange Act
("Sarbanes-Oxley") and (B) the applicable listing and corporate

                                       17

disclosed to Purchaser any of the information required to be disclosed by the
Target and certain of its officers to the Target's Board of Directors or any
committee thereof pursuant to the certification requirements contained in Form
10-K and Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of
Sarbanes-Oxley, neither the Target nor any of its affiliates has made any loans
to any executive officer or director of the Target. The Target has adopted a
plan which would enable it to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of
Sarbanes-Oxley by the time such requirements would be applicable to the Target
if it remained a public company.

               (iv) Each of Target and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all
material respects with all rules and regulations of the BCBSA.

          (j) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and except as disclosed in the Target SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, since December 31, 2002, Target and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course and there has not been (i)
any change, circumstance or event which has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Target or (ii) any action taken by Target
or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from December 31, 2002 through the
date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, would have constituted a breach of Section
4.1.

Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Target, involving any real property

(iii) Target and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Environmental
Liabilities and, to the Knowledge of Target, no facts, circumstances or
conditions relating to, arising from, associated with or attributable to any
real property currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by Target or its
Subsidiaries or operations thereon would reasonably be expected to result in
Environmental Liabilities, (iv) all real property owned and all real property
operated or leased by Target or its Subsidiaries is free of Hazardous Materials
in conditions or concentrations that would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on human health or the environment and none of Target or any of
its Subsidiaries has disposed of any Hazardous Materials on or about such
premises, (v) no release, discharge, spillage or disposal of any Hazardous
Material and no soil, water or air contamination by any Hazardous Material has

Purchaser all material Environmental Reports in the possession or control of
Target or any of its Subsidiaries.

received any notice or has any Knowledge that any other party is, in default (or

          (t) Insurance. Target has provided or made available to Purchaser a
true, correct and complete listing of all policies of insurance to which Target
is currently a party or is a beneficiary or named insured. Target maintains
insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such
risks as are in accordance with normal industry practice for companies engaged
in businesses similar to that of Target (taking into account the cost and
availability of such insurance).

          (u) Opinion of Target Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors of
Target has received the opinion of the Target Financial Advisor, dated the date
of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration
is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Target Common Stock
(other than Purchaser, BCBSUW and their respective affiliates), a copy of which
opinion will be made available to Purchaser solely for informational purposes,
after receipt thereof by Target.

          (v) HIPAA. Target is, and its business is being conducted, in
compliance in all material respects with the Administrative Simplification
provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (including 45 C.F.R. parts 160, 162, and 164)
(collectively, "HIPAA"). Target has formulated and is in the process of
implementing a remediation plan designed to ensure compliance by Target, no
later than October 14, 2003, with any applicable state or federal privacy laws
or regulations (including HIPAA) governing the security, privacy or electronic
or other exchange of health information that are effective or scheduled to
become effective on or prior to December 31, 2003. This remediation plan is
referred to as the "HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan." A copy of the HIPAA/Privacy
Remediation Plan has been provided to Purchaser. The HIPAA/Privacy Remediation
Plan is based upon reasonable determinations concerning: (i) the application of
HIPAA and other state and federal privacy laws and regulations to Target and
(ii) the measures that must be taken to attain compliance with such laws and
regulations by their mandated compliance dates. Target reasonably believes that
the objectives set forth in the HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plans are attainable
in the manner and within the time periods set forth therein (which time periods
have been established to ensure full compliance by the compliance dates imposed
by HIPAA and other state and federal privacy laws and regulations). Target has
completed, and will complete, in all material respects all scheduled actions set
forth in the HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan on or before the dates set forth in
the HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan.

except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors generally or by general equity principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

          (c) Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not contravene or conflict with
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Merger Sub.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     5.1 Preparation of Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting.
(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Target and Purchaser shall
prepare and Target shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and Purchaser
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement
will be included as a prospectus. Each of Target and Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the


                                       29
<PAGE>

Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Target will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Purchaser shall also take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities law in
connection with the issuance of Purchaser Common Stock in connection with the
Merger, and Target shall furnish all information concerning Target and the
holders of Target Common Stock and rights to acquire Target Common Stock
pursuant to the Target Stock Option Plans as may be reasonably required in
connection with any such action. Each of Purchaser and Target shall furnish all
information concerning itself to the other as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of
the Form S-4 and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement. Target, Purchaser and Merger Sub each agrees to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement that
shall have become false or misleading.

          (b) Target, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to
and in accordance with its articles of incorporation and by-laws, promptly and
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable following the
date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective a meeting of the holders of
Target Common Stock (the "Target Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of
voting to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (i) except as otherwise provided herein, recommend approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
stockholders of Target and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation
and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain such
approval. The Board of Directors of Target shall not withhold, withdraw, amend
or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser its recommendation referred to in
clause (i) of the preceding sentence (or announce publicly its intention to do
so), except that such Board of Directors shall be permitted to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation (or publicly announce its intention
to do so) if such Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its failure to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation is or is reasonably likely to be,
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties in accordance with Wisconsin law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a communication by the Board of Directors of
Target to Target's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, or any similar type of communication to Target's stockholders in connection
with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer, shall not be
deemed to constitute a breach of Target's obligations under this Section 5.1(b).

          (c) Target will cause its transfer agent to make stock transfer
records relating to Target available to the extent reasonably necessary to
effectuate the intent of this Agreement.

     5.2 Accountant's Letters. (a) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause to be delivered to Target a letter from Purchaser's independent public
accountants, dated the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective,

          (b) Target shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered
to Purchaser a letter from Target's independent public accountants, dated the
date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective, addressed to Target and
Purchaser, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and
customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent
public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Form S-4.

     5.3 Access to Information(a) . Upon reasonable notice, each party shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of the other
party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to such of its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
records, officers and employees as the other party may reasonably request and,
during such period, such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed, published, announced or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities laws, as applicable (other than documents which such party is
not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (b) consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning it and its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request; provided,
however, that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to
such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any
properties or information. The parties will hold any such information which is
non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the confidentiality agreement dated April 29, 2003 between Target
and Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Any investigation by Purchaser
or Target shall not affect the representations and warranties of Target or
Purchaser, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
any party to this Agreement (and any employee, representative, or other agent of
any party to this Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax structure
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transactions") and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided,
however, that neither party (nor any employee, representative or other agent
thereof) shall disclose any information (a) that is not relevant to an
understanding of the U.S. federal income tax treatment or tax structure of the
Transactions, including the identity of any party to this Agreement (or its
employees, representatives, or other agents) or other information that could
lead any person to determine such identity, (b) to the extent such disclosure
could result in a violation of any federal or state securities laws or (c) until
the earlier of (i) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating
to the Transactions, (ii) the date of the public announcement of the
Transactions and (iii) the date of the execution of an agreement to enter into
the Transactions.

     5.4 Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and
file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, tax ruling requests and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, tax rulings and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this

                                       31
<PAGE>

Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to satisfy the
conditions to Closing set forth herein and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

          (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Purchaser and Target shall cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry.

          (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties
agree that Purchaser shall make such filings as are required in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby on its behalf, including
the "Form A" regulatory filings to be made with the OCI, and shall coordinate
the conduct of the hearing or hearings before the OCI in connection with such
filings. Target and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate with regard to the
content of the filings referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.4(c),
and every such filing shall be subject to the prior approval of Target, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Target and Purchaser, as
the case may be, shall submit all such filings and hearing testimony, witness
lists and other similar materials relating to hearing to the other for its
review prior to filing.

     5.5 No Solicitation of Transactions. Target agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries'
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney
or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate or solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including
by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer with respect to (a) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (b) any
purchase or sale of any significant portion of its assets or equity securities
of it or any of its Subsidiaries, other than as disclosed in Schedule 5.5 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter
referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"). Target further agrees that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries'
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney
or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or
data to any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or engage in any
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Target or its Board of Directors shall be permitted to (a) to the extent
applicable, comply with Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; (b) make any disclosure required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules
of any securities exchange; or (c) engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and only to the
extent that, in the case of

                                       32
<PAGE>

the actions referred to in clause (c), (i) the Board of Directors of Target
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to provide such information or engage in such negotiations is or is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties in
accordance with Wisconsin law, (ii) prior to providing any information or data
to any Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, the
Board of Directors of Target receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms and provisions at least as
restrictive as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which shall not
preclude discussions or negotiations with Purchaser relating to the proposal or
offer from such Person) and (iii) prior to providing any information or data to
any Person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person, the
Board of Directors of Target notifies Purchaser promptly of such inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, or any such discussions or negotiations sought
to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the providing to
Purchaser a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or if no such document
exists providing material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers.
Target agrees that it will keep Purchaser informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. Target agrees that it will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
similar transaction or arrangement and will not waive any rights under any
standstill or confidentiality agreements entered into with such parties. Target
agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals
or entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.5 of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 5.5.

     5.6 Employee Benefits Matters. (a) Continuation and Comparability of
Benefits. Except to the extent the parties mutually agree, from the Effective
Time until December 31, 2004, the Surviving Corporation shall provide
compensation and employee benefits to the employees of Target and its
Subsidiaries (other than those employees whose terms and conditions of
employment are subject to a collective bargaining agreement) employed as of the
Effective Time that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided
to Purchaser's employees generally.

          (b) Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit. With respect to any
Benefit Plans in which any employees of the Target first become eligible to
participate, on or after the Effective Time, and which are plans that the
employees of the Target did not participate in prior to the Effective Time (the
"New Target Plans"), Purchaser shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the employees of the Target under any New Target
Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective
Time and deductibles, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by any
employees of Target during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
shall reduce the amount of deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
payments under the New Target Plans; provided that such employee of Target and
covered family members were enrolled in comparable coverage under the Benefit
Plans of Target on the Effective Time and continuously thereafter until the
effective time of coverage in the New Target Plans, and to the extent such
waiver is permissible under the insurance contracts of Purchaser, and (ii)
recognize service of the employees of the Target with Target accrued prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate

                                       33

and vesting credit in any New Target Plan in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent such service is
taken into account under the applicable New Target Plan. Service with Target
will also be considered under any New Target Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan with a benefit formula based upon final average compensation, with
an offset for any benefit payable for the same period of service with Target
under any defined benefit plan of Target. Purchaser shall credit each employee
of Target with accrued sick leave and vacation as of the Effective Time.
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i)
maintain Target's Code Section 125 plans (the "Target 125 Plans") for the
remainder of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, or (ii)
terminate the Target 125 Plans after the Effective Time and adopt new Code
Section 125 plans (the "New 125 Plans") for employees of Target who were
participating in the Target 125 Plans and transfer the account balances of such
employees under the Target 125 Plans to the New 125 Plans as soon as practicable
after such New 125 Plans are established.

     5.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all
past and present directors, officers and employees of Target and its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Personnel") to the same extent such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement by Target pursuant to Target's certificate of incorporation, by-laws
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
current or former directors, officers and employees of Target and its
Subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
and (ii) purchase as of the Effective Time a tail policy to the current policy
of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by Target which tail policy shall be effective for a period
from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the
Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 900% of the annual
premium currently paid by Target for its current policy of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance; and, provided,
further, that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the
Surviving Corporation after consultation with Target shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

          (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability at least as favorable to
the Indemnified Personnel as those set forth in the current articles of
incorporation and by-laws of Target, and for a period of six years from the
Effective Time, those provisions shall not be repealed or amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnified Personnel, except to the extent, if any, that such modification is
required by applicable law.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Personnel, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective

                                       34
<PAGE>

Time, the provisions of this Section 5.7 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

          (d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Personnel
and their respective heirs and legal representatives, and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Personnel is entitled,
whether pursuant to laws, contract or otherwise.

          (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.7

     5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. Target shall give prompt notice to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Target, of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate and (b) any failure of Target, Purchaser or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

     5.9 Public Announcements. Purchaser and Target shall develop a joint
communications plan and each party shall (a) ensure that all press releases and

(b) unless otherwise required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or
consistent with the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.1, neither Purchaser nor Target shall issue any press release or otherwise
make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the other
party's business, financial condition or results of operations without the

delayed.

integration planning process to ensure the successful combination of the
operations of Target with those of Purchaser. The Transition Team shall be
responsible for developing, and monitoring the development of, and deliverables
due under, an action plan for the combination of the businesses which, among
other things, shall include an information systems action plan intended to
facilitate the most effective combination of the information systems resources
of Target and Purchaser. The Transition Team, or designated representatives
thereof, shall meet monthly to review the financial performance of Target and
its affiliates and at such meetings Target shall advise the Transition Team of
the status of achieving Target's then current Operating Plan (as has been
presented to Purchaser), including all of the material components thereof, such
as sales, enrollment, revenues, investment income, quarterly claim trends,

be informed at each quarterly meeting of the applicable trends and retention
experience arising from Target's business planning and underwriting process.

knowingly take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would
jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless required by law, each of
Purchaser, Merger Sub, and Target shall not file any return or take any position
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization described in
Section 368(a) of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the opinion of their respective
tax counsel in such form and upon such matters as described in Section 6.2(c)
and Section 6.3(c).

best efforts to continue to implement the HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan in
accordance with its terms. Target shall cooperate with Purchaser's reasonable
requests to allow Purchaser to verify the results and efficacy of Target's
implementation of the HIPAA/Privacy Remediation Plan (including, for example,
conducting and participating in testing procedures concerning the transmission
of electronic transactions and reviewing policies and procedures that are
necessary to meet the administrative obligations of the HIPAA privacy rules).

     5.15 Medicare Part A Claims Processing. On or before the Closing Date, the

any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

     8.3 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or

headings contained in this

                                       43
<PAGE>

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The parties have participated
jointly in the negotiating and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

     8.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     8.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. In entering into this Agreement, each
party has relied solely on the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement and acknowledges that neither of the parties nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors
makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied (and agrees that
none of such Persons shall have any liability or responsibility to it in respect
thereof), except as and only to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

          (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided,
however, that Section 5.7 may be enforced against Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation by the Person identified or described therein.

     8.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin.

     8.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

     8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole
or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without
such consent shall be null and void, except that

                                       44
<PAGE>

Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Purchaser without the consent of Target, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

     8.9 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each of Purchaser and Target
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought
and determined in the State Courts of the States of Delaware or New York or the
Federal courts located in such states and each of Purchaser and Target hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and
in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of Purchaser and Target hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully
serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

     8.10 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
