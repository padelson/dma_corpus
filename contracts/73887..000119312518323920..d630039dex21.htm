limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(including its successors, the "Purchaser"), Columbia Helicopters, Inc., an
Oregon corporation (the "Company"), the Persons listed on attached  _Schedule
1_ (each, a "Shareholder" and, collectively, the "Shareholders"), and Nancy C.
Lematta, but solely in her capacity as the Shareholder representative (the
"Shareholder Representative"). Purchaser, the Company, the Shareholders, and
the Shareholder Representative are sometimes referred to in this Agreement
each as a "Party" and, collectively, as the "Parties."

Common Stock (collectively, the "Shares").

B. The Shares represent all of the issued and outstanding equity securities
(and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company.

C. The Shareholders wish to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser wishes to
purchase from the Shareholders, the Shares, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

 

D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain holders of
Phantom Unit Awards (as defined in  _Appendix_ __ _ 1.1_) have entered into
subscription agreements with Parent (collectively, the "Subscription
Agreements") pursuant to which, subject to and immediately following the
consummation of the Transactions, such holders have agreed to purchase, and
Parent has agreed to issue, shares of Parent Common Stock on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable Subscription Agreement.

 

E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Family Shareholders
(as defined in _Appendix 1.1_ ) and Parent have entered into a Stockholders
Agreement that will be effective as of, and subject to, the Closing (the
"Stockholders Agreement").

Now therefore in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

3.1 Aggregate Consideration.

(a) The aggregate consideration for the sale and transfer of the Shares to

(b) Defined Terms.

(i) "Cash Purchase Price" means an amount, without duplication, equal to the
sum of:

 

(A) $492,400,000;

 

(B) plus the Closing Cash;

(B) if the Aggregate Aircraft Amount is less than $305,000,000, then a
negative number equal to the lesser (in absolute terms) of (1) the amount by

$5,000,000; or

 

(C) If the Aggregate Aircraft Amount is between $305,000,000 and $325,000,000,

effect on the Closing Date, but excluding any insurance proceeds received or
receivable under any insurance policy in connection with the damage or

Balance Sheet ("Insurance Proceeds"); for the avoidance of doubt, (A) Closing
Cash shall be calculated net of issued ( _i.e._ , checks mailed or, if payment
is made electronically, the effective date of such payment has occurred) but
uncleared checks and drafts and (B) Closing Cash shall include checks and
drafts which are immediately convertible into cash received by the Company as

Obligations, that is funded and outstanding as of the Effective Closing Time.

before Closing that were incurred in connection with preparing and executing
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and consummating the Transactions,
including (A) fees and disbursements of brokers, attorneys, accountants,
financial advisors and other advisors and service providers, payable by any
Acquired Company under _Section_ __ _ 14.8_, (B) any severance resulting
from any termination of employment prior to the Closing Date (other than

accordance with the Net Working Capital Calculation Methodology, the excess,
if any, of:

(A) the sum of all current assets of the Acquired Companies that are included
in the line item categories of current assets of the type identified on
_Schedule_ __ _ 3.1(b)(viii)_, excluding for the avoidance of doubt any (1)
current assets in Closing Cash, Excluded Assets or NWC Exclusions; and (2)
the items reflected in the Aggregate Aircraft Amount; minus

 

(B) all current liabilities of the Acquired Companies that are included in the
line item categories of current liabilities of the type identified on

(b) At Closing, Parent will issue, or will cause to be transferred, to each
Family Shareholder the Family Shareholders Proportion of the Stock
Consideration, rounded down to the nearest whole share, which shares may be
represented by book-entry interests or one or more certificates issued to each
Family Shareholder, at Parents election.

 

(c) Attached _Schedule 3.2(c)_ sets forth an illustrative calculation of the
Projected Cash Purchase Price, including projected Net Working Capital, based
on information available as of the Execution Date and certain assumptions as
to items that cannot be determined until the Effective Closing Time.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Shareholder
Representative shall be solely responsible for determining the allocation of
the Consideration for distribution in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.2_ and shall provide Purchaser with written instructions setting forth the
allocation of the Consideration (including the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock representing the Stock Consideration to be issued or
transferred to each Family Shareholder and the amount of the Projected Cash
Purchase Price to be distributed to each Shareholder) at least three Business
Days prior to the Closing. Upon compliance with the instructions provided to
Purchaser in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, Purchaser shall be
discharged of any and all liability or other responsibility in connection with
distributing the Consideration.

3.3 Procedure for Determining Projected Cash Purchase Price and Final Cash
Purchase Price.

 

(a) Projected Cash Purchase Price. At least three Business Days but no more
than five Business Days before Closing, the Shareholder Representative or her
Agents will deliver (i) the Shareholders written good faith estimate of the
Final Cash Purchase Price (the "Projected Cash Purchase Price") to Purchaser,
in substantially the form of, and including the line items shown in,
_Schedule 3.2(c)_ with reasonable supporting detail, which will include (A)
the Shareholders good faith estimate of Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses, and Aircraft Adjustment
Amount, (B) the Shareholders good faith estimate of the consolidated closing
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective Closing Time
prepared in accordance with GAAP (without giving effect to the purchase and
sale of the Shares or the other transactions pursuant to this Agreement), and
the other principles set forth on _Schedule 3.2(c)_ , and (C) any other
information, data or calculation that is reasonably necessary to support the
Shareholders determination of the Projected Cash Purchase Price and (ii) an
updated version of the Phantom Unit Schedule as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Phantom Unit Schedule"). The Shareholder Representative

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 shall make her Agents reasonably available, and the Companys
representatives shall be reasonably available, to Purchaser prior to the
Closing and following delivery of the Projected Cash Purchase Price and the
Closing Phantom Unit Schedule to discuss the calculation of the Projected Cash
Purchase Price and Phantom Plan Payments. The Shareholders shall consider in
good faith any reasonable comments of Purchaser and correct any undisputed
errors in the Projected Cash Purchase Price and Phantom Plan Payments prior to
Closing (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that any failure of
Purchaser to dispute any item or aspect pursuant to this sentence shall
not preclude Purchaser from exercising any other rights under this
Agreement).

(b) Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price. Within 90 days after Closing,
Purchaser or its Agents will deliver Purchasers good faith determination of
the Final Cash Purchase Price (the "Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price") to
the Shareholder Representative, in substantially the form of, and including
the line items shown in, _Schedule 3.2(c)_ , with reasonable supporting
detail, which will include Purchasers (i) calculation of Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses, and
Aircraft Adjustment Amount, (ii) the consolidated closing balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of the Effective Closing Time prepared in accordance
with GAAP (without giving effect to the purchase and sale of the Shares or the
other transactions pursuant to this Agreement), (iii) calculation of the
Final Closing Payment under _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and (iv) any other
calculation, information and data that is reasonably necessary to support
its determination of the Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price.

(c) Review and Resolution of Disputes Concerning the Final Cash Purchase
Price.

(i) Within 60 days after it receives Purchasers determination of the Proposed
Final Cash Purchase Price (the "Review Period"), the Shareholder
Representative may dispute any items included in that determination. During
the Review Period, Purchaser will make reasonably available to the Shareholder
Representative and her Agents all relevant books, records and work papers
(including those of Purchasers internal and external accountants) in
Purchasers possession or under its control relating to its determination of
the Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price and all other items reasonably
requested by the Shareholder Representative or her Agents in connection with
the determination of the Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price.

 

(ii) If the Shareholder Representative indicates in a signed writing that she
is satisfied with the Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price, or if she does not
deliver an Objection to Purchaser before the end of the Review Period, then
the Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price shall become the Final Cash Purchase
Price and shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties. If the
Shareholder Representative disputes Purchasers calculation of the Final Cash
Purchase Price, then the Shareholder Representative will so inform Purchaser
in writing (the "Objection") during the Review Period. The Objection will
include all disputed items and describe the basis of the Objection for each
item in reasonable detail. If the Objection does not dispute the determination
of one or more items reflected in Purchasers calculation of the Final Cash
Purchase Price, then Purchasers determination of those items will be final.

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 7

    

(iii) The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputed items
within 30 days after Purchaser receives the Objection. If the Parties resolve
all of the disputed items in the Objection, then the Proposed Final Cash
Purchase Price (incorporating, if applicable, any adjustments agreed in
writing by both Parties) shall become the Final Cash Purchase Price and shall
be binding and conclusive upon the Parties.

(iv) If the Parties do not resolve all of the disputed items within the
30-day period, the remaining disputed items (collectively, the "Remaining
Disputed Items") will be submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or another
independent accounting firm agreed upon by Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). The scope of the review by
the Independent Accounting Firm will be limited to (i) determining whether the
Remaining Disputed Items were prepared in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.1_ and (ii) based on its determinations of the matters described in clause
(i), preparing and delivering to the Parties a statement of the adjustments
(if any) to the Proposed Final Cash Purchase Price that are necessary with
respect to the Remaining Disputed Items to comply with the requirements of
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_. The Independent Accounting Firm shall not make, or be
asked to make, any determinations other than those described in the preceding
sentence.

(v) Purchaser and Shareholder Representative shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render its written
decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as practicable
after submission of the Remaining Disputed Items, and in any event within 60
days after it accepts the referral and on the basis set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ 3_. The Parties will make readily available to the Independent
Accounting Firm all relevant books, records and workpapers (including those of
their respective internal and external accountants) in their respective
possession or under their respective control relating to the calculation of
the Remaining Disputed Items. During the 60-day review period, neither Party,
nor any of their Agents, will communicate with the Independent Accounting Firm
regarding its review and determination, unless the Party wishing to initiate
communication with the Independent Accounting Firm has first provided
the other Party with at least five Business Days prior written notice of the
proposed communication and an opportunity to be present for or otherwise
participate in the communication. The Independent Accounting Firms
determination of the proper calculation of the Remaining Disputed Items will:

(A) be no less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either Purchaser or
the Shareholders, and no greater than the greater of the amount claimed by
either Purchaser or the Shareholders;

(B) be delivered in writing to Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative,
and will include a reasoned explanation of the final determination(s) and the
responsibility of Purchaser and the Shareholders for the Independent
Accounting Firms cost and expenses of its review and report determined in
accordance with _subsection 3.3(c)(vi)_ ; and

(C) be conclusive and binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal by any
Party.

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 8

    

(vi) Purchaser will pay the portion of the cost and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firms review and report that is represented by the
dollar value of all Remaining Disputed Items that the Independent Accounting
Firm determines are in accordance with or closest to the Shareholders
position, divided by to the total dollar value of the Remaining Disputed
Items. The Shareholders will pay the remainder, if any, of those costs and
expenses. For example, if the dollar value of the Remaining Disputed Items is
$100 and the Independent Accounting Firm determines that items totaling $80
are in accordance with or closest to the Shareholders position and items
totaling $20 are in accordance with or closest to Purchasers position, then
the Independent Accounting Firms costs and expenses would be paid 20% by the
Shareholders and 80% by Purchaser.

3.4 Final Closing Payment. Within five days after the Final Cash Purchase
Price is ultimately determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_:

(a) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is less than the Projected Cash Purchase
Price, then the Shareholders shall pay to Purchaser, severally in accordance
with the percentage of the Projected Cash Purchase Price paid to each such
Shareholder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ (as directed by the
Shareholder Representative) and by bank wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser to the Shareholder
Representative, the amount of cash equal to such shortfall.

 

(b) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Projected Cash
Purchase Price, then Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Shareholders in accordance with the percentage of the Projected Cash
Purchase Price paid to each such Shareholder pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)_ (as directed by the Shareholder Representative), an amount in cash
equal to such excess. With respect to the Shareholders, such amounts shall be
paid by Purchaser by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts designated in writing by the Shareholder Representative to Purchaser.

 

(c) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is equal to the Projected Cash Purchase
Price, then there will be no adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

 instrument or agreement to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser

or Parent to consummate the Transactions, except: (a) for any consent,

STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 13

    

(ii) The net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters, together with
cash and cash equivalents or other sources of immediately available funds
available to Purchaser on the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be
sufficient to consummate the Transactions upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses associated with the
Transactions, including payment of all amounts under _Article_ __ _ 3_.
Purchaser has fully paid all commitment fees and other fees in connection with
the Commitment Letters that are payable on or before the Execution Date.
Purchaser has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy any term
or condition of closing to be satisfied by it or its Affiliate(s) contained in
either Commitment Letter.

 

(iii) As of the Execution Date:

 

(A) each Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to the Company, is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or
Purchaser, as applicable, and, to Purchasers Knowledge, the other parties to
such Commitment Letter;

 

(B) neither Commitment Letter has been amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in any respect and the respective commitments contained in the
Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect;

(C) no event has occurred that, with or without the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both, would (1) constitute a default or breach by Parent
or Purchaser, as applicable, under any term or condition of either Commitment
Letter, or (2) individually or in the aggregate permit the Debt Financing
Sources or Investors, as applicable, to terminate the applicable Commitment
Letter or not to make the initial funding of the facilities to be established
under (in the case of the Debt Financing) or not to purchase the secured
convertible senior notes to be purchased under (in the case of the Convertible
Notes Financing) the applicable Commitment Letter upon satisfaction of all
conditions to the Commitment Letters; and

 

(D) except as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no (1) conditions
precedent to the respective obligations of the Debt Financing Sources or
Investors in the applicable Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of the
Financing (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any "flex" provision in the
fee letter related to the Debt Commitment Letter); or (2) contractual
contingencies under any agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to
the Financing to which either Purchaser or its Affiliates is a party that
would permit the Debt Financing Sources or Investors to reduce the
total amount of the Financing, or that would materially and adversely affect
the availability of the Financing.

(b) Source of Funds. The source of funds for payment of the Transaction
Payments will not violate any Law and Purchasers actions in funding the
Transaction Payments will not violate any Law in any material respect.

 

(c) OFAC Compliance. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (i) appears
on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of OFAC or
(ii) otherwise is a party with which any Acquired Company is prohibited to

5.8 Parent SEC Reports. Accurate and complete copies of each report,
registration statement, prospectus, schedule, form, statement, and definitive
proxy statement that Parent has filed with the SEC in the 12-month period
preceding the Execution Date (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports") have

regulations promulgated thereunder (as the case may be), and (b) none of the
Parent SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

subject to customary year-end adjustments and lack footnotes. Parent maintains
a system of internal account controls and procedures designed to record
transactions as reasonably necessary to permit the preparation of its
financial statements in conformity with GAAP.

required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against in the Parent Financial
Statements, except (a) as expressly reflected or reserved against in the

The Company makes the following representations and warranties to Purchaser,
subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by

7.8 Brokers. No Shareholder has retained, utilized or been represented by any
broker, finder or similar agent in connection with the Transactions and no
Shareholder has any liability or obligation to any Person for any brokerage
commission, finders fee or any similar compensation in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions.

7.9 Investment Representation. Each Family Shareholder is an "accredited
investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the 1933
Act. Each Family Shareholder acknowledges that it is informed as to the risks
of the ownership of Parent Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration as
contemplated hereby and has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such
ownership, and is able to bear the economic risk of such ownership for an
indefinite period of time. Each Family Shareholder has been furnished access
to such information and documents as it has requested and has been afforded an
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from representatives of
Parent concerning the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

7.10 Restricted Securities. Each Family Shareholder understands that neither
the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration nor the transfer of such shares to the Family Shareholders has
been registered under the 1933 Act, by reason of a specific exemption from the
registration provisions of the 1933 Act which depends upon, among other
things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of the
Family Shareholders representations as expressed herein. Each Family
Shareholder understands that the shares of Parent Common Stock are
"restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities
laws and that, pursuant to these laws, such Family Shareholder must hold the
Parent Common Stock indefinitely unless and until they are registered with the
SEC and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such
registration and qualification requirements is available. Each Family
Shareholder acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or
qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements
including the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Parent
Common Stock, and on requirements relating to Parent which are outside of such
Family Shareholders control, which Parent is under no obligation, and may
not be able, to satisfy.

7.11 Resale of Shares.

 

(a) Each Family Shareholder understands and agrees that it may not sell or
otherwise transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration, except pursuant to an effective registration under the 1933
Act, or in a transaction which qualifies as an exempt transaction under the
1933 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and in
accordance with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement.

(b) Each Family Shareholder acknowledges that each certificate or instrument
evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration shall initially bear substantially the following restrictive
legend, either as an endorsement, on the face thereof or a comparable notation
or other arrangement with respect to any uncertificated shares:

things within its control, necessary to fulfill the conditions precedent to
the obligations of the other Parties, subject to completion of the
Marketing Period, and to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the Transactions and to cooperate with each other in connection
with the foregoing. Without limitation:

 

(a) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain those
third party consents and other approvals or waivers required with respect to
the Transactions, including consents as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.4(a)_
(the "Required Consents"). Purchaser will coordinate and cooperate with the
Company in exchanging all information and assistance that the Company

_provided_ that, with respect to the Designated Consents, Purchaser shall have
the right to direct the nature, timing and content of all communications with
the relevant contractual counterparties in connection with obtaining the
Designated Consents, and the Company shall coordinate and cooperate with
Purchaser in exchanging all information and assistance that Purchaser
reasonably requests in connection with obtaining the Designated Consents.
Each Party will supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that is requested by any applicable third party with
respect to a Required Consent; and

(b) The Company will give the notices to, make the filings with, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the authorizations, consents and

the Parties) to consummate the Transactions, including as set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 8.4(b)_.

 

"Commercially reasonable efforts" with respect to any Required Consents other
than the Designated Consents will not require the payment of any cash or
other consideration by any Acquired Company. The Company and the Shareholders
will be responsible for the payment of any cash or other consideration that is
required to be paid, performed or delivered in order to obtain each of the
Designated Consents (and, in the event that any such payment or consideration
is not paid or performed in full prior to the Closing, the value of the
remaining portion of any such payment or consideration shall be included in
the definition of "Company Transaction Expenses"); _provided_ that the
Company and the Shareholders, collectively, will not be required to pay cash
or other consideration with a value in excess of the amount set forth on
_Schedule 8.4(b)_ in the aggregate with respect to obtaining all Designated
Consents nor shall any such excess be included in the definition of "Company
Transaction Expenses." The negotiation of, and agreement on the terms of, any
such payment or consideration shall be subject to the direction of Purchaser
and to Purchasers consent.

8.5 Confidentiality. Unless and until the Transactions have been consummated,
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, the
Confidentiality Agreement will remain in effect and will govern the Parties
rights and obligations with respect to the matters set forth therein. From
and after the Closing, Shareholders shall keep all competitively sensitive
proprietary or confidential information that pertains to the Acquired
Companies confidential.

8.6 HSR Act Filing.

 

(a) Each Party will:

(i) Promptly give all notices to and make all filings with Government
Authorities required under the HSR Act and similar state or foreign Laws,
including the Notification and Report Forms and related material each Party is
required to file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act (collectively,
"Required HSR Filings"); and

 

(ii) Use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents
and approvals required under the HSR Act and similar state or foreign Laws.

(b) Each Party will file the required Notification and Report Forms and
related material no later than ten Business Days after the Execution Date.
Purchaser will be responsible for paying all filing fees with regard to the
Required HSR Filings. The Company will coordinate and cooperate with Purchaser
in exchanging all information and assistance that Purchaser reasonably
requests in connection with all of the foregoing. Each Party will (i) supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that is requested by any applicable Government Authority pursuant to the
HSR Act and (ii) use its best efforts to obtain early termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event will Purchaser be obligated to offer or
agree to or accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent
decree, to make any divestiture or to accept any operation restriction, or to
offer to take any other action, in each case, if such undertaking, condition,
consent decree, divestiture, restriction or action would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Purchaser (after giving effect
to the Transactions).

 

(c) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 8.6(a)_, but subject to _Section_ __ _
8.6(b)_, if any objections are asserted by any Government Authority or any
third party with respect to the Transactions under any Law, then each Party
will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all objections to permit the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

8.7 Financing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent or
Purchaser, as applicable, will:

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain on a timely basis the Financing on the terms
and conditions (or terms and conditions not materially less favorable to
Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, unless agreed to by the Company) described
in the Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions set
forth in any fee letter related to the Debt Commitment Letter); and

(ii) not agree to or permit, without the Companys prior written consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld) any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, either Commitment Letter if that
amendment, modification or

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 53

    

 waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate cash proceeds available from the
Financing below the amount necessary to fund (together with cash and cash
equivalents or other sources of immediately available funds available to
Purchaser on the Closing Date) the Transaction Payments, or (B) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any existing
conditions, to the receipt of the Financing, in the case of either clause (A)
or (B) above, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or
materially delay the Closing, (2) make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) materially less
likely to occur, or (3) adversely impact Parents or Purchasers, as
applicable, ability to enforce its rights under the Financing Agreements (as
defined below) or Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions.

(b) Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to:

 

(i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to each
Commitment Letter on terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
or on other terms and conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, or the Company on a timely basis
(the definitive agreements, together with the Commitment Letters, the
"Financing Agreements");

(ii) maintain the Financing Agreements, including the Commitment Letters, in
effect;

 

(iii) promptly upon executing the Financing Agreements provide complete
executed copies to the Company;

 

(iv) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the
Financing Agreements applicable to Parent or Purchaser, as applicable,
obtaining the Financing;

(v) consummate the Financing at or before the Closing; and

 

(vi) fully enforce the counterparties obligations and its rights under the
Financing Agreements, including by suit or other proceeding if deemed
appropriate by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, to cause the Debt Financing
Sources or Investors, as applicable, under the Financing to fund in accordance
with their respective commitments if all conditions to funding the Financing
in the applicable Financing Agreements have been satisfied or waived.

(c) Parent and Purchaser, as applicable, will keep the Company reasonably
informed on a timely basis of the status of Parents and Purchasers, as
applicable, efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy its conditions,
including, at the Companys request, (i) advising and updating the Company,
in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date
and material terms of the Financing Agreements; and (ii) providing copies of
the current drafts of all Financing Agreements to the Company.

 

(d) If any portion of the amount of the Financing becomes, or would reasonably
be expected to become, unavailable on the material terms and conditions
contemplated by the applicable Commitment Letter (other than as a direct
result of the breach by the Company or the Shareholders of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein 

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 54

    

 or as a direct result of the failure of a condition contained herein to be
satisfied by the Company or the Shareholders), then Parent or Purchaser, as
applicable, will (i) promptly notify the Company; and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions (including cash and cash equivalents or other sources
of immediately available funds available to Purchaser) and with terms and
conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent or
Purchaser, as applicable, or the Company than the terms and conditions set
forth in the applicable Financing Agreements ("Alternative Financing") as
promptly as practicable. In that event, (A) the term "Financing" as used in
this Agreement will be deemed to include the Alternative Financing, (B) the
term "Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include any commitment letters
with respect to the Alternative Financing and (C) the term "Financing
Agreements" will be deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect to
the Alternative Financing.

(e) The Company will, and will cause the other Acquired Companies to, and will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Agents to, in each case
at Purchasers sole cost and expense, provide Parent and Purchaser, as
applicable, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser that
is customary and necessary in connection with arranging and obtaining the
Financing and causing the conditions in the Financing Agreements to be
satisfied. In performing its foregoing obligations under this _Section_ __ _
8.7(e)_, the Company will and will cause the other Acquired Companies to and
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Agents to, as
applicable, in each case at Purchasers sole cost and expense, (i) provide
reasonably required information relating to the Company and the other
Acquired Companies to the Debt Financing Sources or Investors, as applicable,
(ii) participate in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions,
presentations, road shows, sessions with prospective lenders, investors and
rating agencies, in each case, in connection with the Financing, (iii) assist
in the preparation of (A) any offering documents, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in

be required notwithstanding the commercially reasonable efforts standard

presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts for any
portion of the Financing, (v) execute and deliver (or use commercially

pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be
reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing, (vi) assist in
obtaining such consents, waivers, estoppels, approvals, authorizations and
instruments that may be reasonably requested in connection with the Financing
and any collateral arrangements therefor, including customary payoff letters,
lien releases, instruments of termination or discharge, appraisals, surveys,
landlord consents, waivers and access agreements, (vii) furnishing Parent and
the Debt Financing Sources or Investors, as applicable, promptly, and in any
event no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with all
documentation and other information which any Debt Financing Source or
Investor, as applicable, has reasonably determined is required by U.S.
regulatory authorities in connection with any portion of the Financing under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and

 regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership
Regulation (which cooperation shall be required notwithstanding the
commercially reasonable efforts standard required of the Company above),
(viii) enter into one or more secured or unsecured credit or other agreements,
or related guarantees and other ancillary agreements on terms satisfactory to

Securities Act in each case by the Company, including all financial
statements described in paragraph 4 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter
and all financial statements and financial data of the type and form required

forma basis giving effect to the Transactions) of guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries shall be provided), CDandA and other information required by Item
402(b) of Regulation S-K and information regarding executive compensation and
related pension disclosure rules related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A,
34-54302A and IC-27444A or other information or financial data customarily
excluded from an offering memorandum for a "Rule 144A Offering"), (x) take all
actions reasonably necessary in connection with the termination at the Closing
of all commitments in respect of the Existing Debt (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter), and any other Indebtedness, in each case to the extent
contemplated by or required in connection with the Financing (collectively,
the "Existing Debt"), the repayment in full on the Closing Date of all
obligations in respect of the Existing Debt, and the release of related Liens
securing such Existing Debt and guarantees in connection therewith, (xi)
causing the Companys independent auditors to cooperate in connection
with the Debt Financing (including providing accountants comfort letters and
consents from the Companys independent auditors to the extent required by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements) and (xii) take all
corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably
necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing and the direct borrowing
or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing by the Company
concurrently with the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement will require any Acquired Company or any Shareholder to (A) prior to
the Closing Date, pay any commitment, consent or similar fee or incur any
liability in connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing that
is not advanced by Purchaser unless simultaneously reimbursed or reasonably
satisfactorily indemnified by Purchaser, (B) take any action or do anything
that would contravene applicable Law or any Scheduled Contract, or (C)
disclose any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Acquired
Companies would result in the disclosure of trade secrets or similar
confidential or proprietary information without an executed confidentiality
agreement in customary form binding on the recipient of the information.
Purchaser shall promptly upon request by the Company and from time to time pay
to or reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by any Acquired Company or their

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 56

    

 Agents in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 8.7_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ or
otherwise will obligate any Acquired Company to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Financing before Closing.

(f) Purchaser acknowledges that obtaining the Financing, or any Alternative
Financing, is not a condition to Closing and confirms its obligation to
consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability
of the Financing or any Alternative Financing, subject to fulfillment or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Parents or
Purchasers inability to consummate the Financing is attributable to the
Companys failure to comply with its obligations under _Sections_ __ _ 6.10_,
_8.1(a)_ , or  _8.7(e)_ , then, for all purposes under this Agreement, Parent
or Purchaser shall not be deemed in breach of the covenants in this _Section_
__ _ 8.7_, the representations in _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ or the covenant in
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ with respect to payments described in _Article_ __ _
3_.

8.8 NYSE Listing. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration
to be listed on the NYSE.

 

8.9 Further Environmental Provisions.

 

(a) The Shareholders shall cause the Acquired Companies to complete the scope
of work contemplated in the Phase II Environmental Plan prior to Closing to
enable the Shareholders and the Purchaser to establish the scope of the
required Remedial Action, if any. If any post-Closing Remedial Action will or
is likely to be necessary, the Parties will discuss and use their
commercially reasonably efforts to agree upon a mechanism to ensure to
Purchasers reasonable satisfaction that the funds necessary to complete or
pay for the Excluded Environmental Liabilities pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.9_ or  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ (the "Necessary Environmental Funds") will be
available from the Shareholders after Closing.

 

(b) With respect to any Remedial Action falling within the definition of
Excluded Environmental Liabilities, after the Closing:

 

(i) The Shareholders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct
and control the Remedial Action; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if the
Shareholders opt to conduct such Remedial Action, the Shareholders shall do so
without unreasonably interfering with the Purchasers operations at any of the
Acquired Companies Real Property or Improvements and _provided_ _further_ ,
that the Shareholders shall not agree to any Orders that affect the Real
Property or Improvements without Purchasers written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and the Shareholders
shall provide Purchaser with copies of all notices received in connection with
such Remedial Action and the right to participate in any interactions with, or
submissions to, any Government Authorities;

 

(ii) To the extent that the Shareholders elect to conduct and control the
Remedial Action in accordance with subsection (b)(i) above, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and their respective
representatives to, cooperate with the Shareholders, including by providing
reasonable access to the subject site, including access to install, maintain,
replace and operate wells and remove impacted soil and/or groundwater; and

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 57

    

 (iii) The Shareholders shall only be liable for (or obligated to complete to
the extent that the Shareholders elect to conduct and control the Remedial
Action) Remedial Action that is conducted in the most cost-effective manner,
which shall incorporate (A) the least stringent clean-up standards that, based
upon the use classification (industrial, commercial or residential) of a
subject site, are allowed under applicable Environmental, Health and Safety
Law; and (B) the least-costly methods that do not unreasonably interfere with
the Purchasers or any of the Acquired Companies operations at any of its
Real Property or Improvements, as are allowed under applicable Environmental,
Health and Safety Law, and are approved by or otherwise acceptable to
applicable Government Authorities to achieve such standards, including the use
of engineering and institutional controls to eliminate or minimize exposure
pathways. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, be
responsible for any operation and maintenance with respect to any such
institutional or engineering controls subsequent to completion of their
initial installation, and such post-installation costs shall not be subject to
indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders shall remain
responsible for the operation and maintenance of any such control that
entails removing and treating groundwater contaminated with Materials of
Environmental Concern until such removal and treatment is no longer required.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, all Remedial Action (regardless of which Party performs the
work) shall be completed in accordance with Prudent Industry Practices.

8.10 FOCI Mitigation. The Parties agree to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any foreign ownership control or influence ("FOCI") as
provided in the NISPOM. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event will Purchaser or Parent be obligated to accept any
U.S. Department of Defense Defense Security Service ("DSS") requirement for a
Special Security Agreement, Proxy Agreement or Voting Trust Agreement (in
each case, as such terms are used in the NISPOM paragraph 2-303). In making
any disclosures or conducting any meetings or exchanges with DSS regarding
these efforts, each Party agrees to: (a) furnish to the other Party, upon
reasonable request, all information concerning itself, its subsidiaries,
directors, officers, and shareholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or
application under the NISPOM in connection with the Transactions; (b)
promptly notify the other Party of any written communication received from DSS
relating to the Transactions, and permit the other Party to review in advance
any proposed written communication to DSS; (c) not agree to participate in
any substantive meeting or discussion with DSS in respect of any filings or
inquiry concerning this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by DSS, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and/or participate; and (d) promptly furnish the other
Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between such Party and DSS with respect to this Agreement. Each Party shall
respond as promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries
received from DSS in connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing obligations of the Parties, in connection with any of
the Shareholders or Companys discussions with DSS with respect to
appropriate FOCI mitigation measures to be implemented by the Company, the
Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, advise the Purchaser
on a timely basis of the status of its discussions, consult with Purchaser
with respect to any specific proposal to be made to or request received from
DSS relating to potential FOCI mitigation measures and, prior to agreeing with
DSS regarding any FOCI mitigation, obtain the prior written consent of
Purchaser.

case as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent

in all material respects on the date so specified). The representations and
warranties of Purchaser set forth in _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3(a)_ and

its terms to a specific date (in which case the representation and warranty
need only be true and correct on the date so specified), except for any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of those representations and warranties that
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result

ARTICLE 10

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

10.1 Further Assurances. The Parties will, without further consideration,
execute and deliver any other instruments or documents, and take all further
action, required to be delivered pursuant to, or necessary or proper to give
effect to and carry out the intent of, all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. Each Party shall cooperate affirmatively with the other
Parties, to the extent reasonably requested by such other Parties, to enforce
rights and obligations provided herein.

10.2 Publicity. Except for any Required Public Disclosure, no Party (or any
of its Affiliates or representatives) will make any public release,
announcement, or other disclosure concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions without Purchasers and the Shareholder Representatives advance
approval of the disclosure (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative will
each furnish to the other drafts of all proposed press releases or
announcements relating to the Transactions before their release.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall be permitted
to issue a public release, announcement or disclosure (including responding to
questions from analysts, members of the press, and investors of Purchaser)
containing information that is substantially consistent with the information
in any public release, announcement, or other disclosure that has previously
been approved by the Shareholder Representative. Purchaser will use its best
efforts to furnish the Shareholder Representative with a draft of the initial
Required Public Disclosures relating to the Transactions at least 48 hours
before their release and to provide the Shareholder Representative or her
Agent the opportunity during that period to review and comment on those
Required Public Disclosures. Purchaser will furnish the Shareholder
Representative with a draft of, and afford the Shareholder Representative
the opportunity to review and comment on, any subsequent Required Public
Disclosures if the information included in any subsequent Required Public
Disclosure is materially different from the information included in the
initial Required Public Disclosures. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_
prevents any Party from (a) at any time furnishing any required information to
any Government Authority having jurisdiction or from making any disclosures
required under the HSR Act, or (b) furnishing any information concerning the
Transactions to the Partys Representatives.

10.3 Business Records; Attorney Records.

(a) Business Records. Purchaser acknowledges that access to and control of the
business records of each Acquired Company relating to their respective
operations before Closing will be acquired by Purchaser when the Transactions
are consummated, and that the Shareholders may from time to time after Closing
require access to those records. To the extent

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 63

    

 required by Law or reasonably necessary in connection with any audit,
assessment or reassessment of any Shareholder by the IRS or any Tax Authority
or any Action involving a Shareholder, upon reasonable prior notice from a
Shareholder, Purchaser will, during normal business hours, provide or cause to
be provided to the Shareholder access to those records (subject to applicable
Law, _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, and confidentiality obligations to third parties).
Purchaser will not (and will cause each of its Affiliates, including Acquired
Companies not to), for a period of six years after Closing, destroy any
material business records of any Acquired Company prepared before Closing
without first notifying the Shareholder Representative and affording the
Shareholder Representative a reasonable opportunity to remove or copy those
records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such access shall be permitted
to the extent that (i) it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), (ii) it
would result in the disclosure of any competitively sensitive information of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or
(iii) legal counsel for Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as applicable,
determines in good faith that such access would jeopardize the ability to
successfully assert a claim of legal privilege (including the attorney-client
and work product privileges) or contravene any Law or Contract with any third
party to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party or is subject;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any such Contract, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the applicable
Shareholder to enter into reasonable and appropriate work-around arrangements
to permit such access by the applicable Shareholder to the extent practicable
(and without contravening such Contract).

(b) Attorney Records. Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_, the Attorney
Records will belong solely to the Shareholders, and neither Purchaser nor,
after Closing, the Acquired Companies, will have any right to review, access
or obtain copies of the Attorney Records. The Company waives, for itself and
each Acquired Company, all rights any of them may have with respect to any
Attorney Records and authorizes the deletion of all Attorney Records
maintained in electronic form. All rights to the Attorney Records, and the
control of the confidentiality and privilege applicable to the Attorney
Records, will be retained by Shareholders (and not any Acquired Company) after
Closing. Neither Purchaser nor, after Closing, the Acquired Companies, may use
any Attorney Records against, or to the detriment of, any Shareholder, and
neither Purchaser nor, after Closing, the Acquired Companies will by reason
thereof assert any loss of confidentiality or privilege protection. All
Attorney Records in the possession of any Acquired Company on the Closing
Date will be immediately delivered to the Shareholder Representative or, if
maintained in electronic form, permanently deleted. If Purchaser or any
Acquired Company discovers any Attorney Records after Closing it will
promptly notify the Shareholder Representative and deliver those Attorney
Records to the Shareholder Representative. Purchasers or any Acquired
Companys subsequent discovery of any Attorney Records will not itself
constitute or result in any waiver of the attorney-client privilege by any
Shareholder.

10.4 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Tax Returns.

(i) The Shareholder Representative will prepare or cause to be prepared any
Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period that ends on or
before the date

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 64

    

 prior to the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Return"). All Pre-Closing Returns
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice, methods and
elections of the Acquired Companies, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. No later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing
any Pre-Closing Return (after giving effect to any permitted extensions), the
Shareholder Representative will submit any such Pre-Closing Return to
Purchaser for review, comment and approval by Purchaser, which approval may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Shareholder
Representative will reflect any reasonable comments on any Pre-Closing
Return provided by Purchaser no later than 15 days before the due date for
filing such Tax Return (after giving effect to any permitted extensions). The
Shareholder Representative and Purchaser will attempt in good faith to resolve
any disagreements regarding any Pre-Closing Return before the due date for
filing. If the Shareholder Representative and Purchaser do not resolve any
dispute with respect to a Pre-Closing Return before the due date for filing,
the dispute will be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for
resolution (if practicable, at least 10 days before the filing due date, but
in any event the submission to the Independent Accounting Firm will be made
sufficiently in advance of the filing due date to permit a review by the
Independent Accounting Firm). The Independent Accounting Firms resolution
will be conclusive and binding on all Parties. If for any reason the
dispute is not resolved at least two days before the Pre-Closing Return is
due, the Pre-Closing Return will be filed in the manner that the Shareholder
Representative deems to be correct. After the Independent Accounting Firms
determination, if needed, the Shareholder Representative will cause an amended
Pre-Closing Return to be filed in accordance with the final determination.
The costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be borne
equally by the Shareholders, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand. The Party responsible for the filing of any Pre-Closing Return will
timely file such Tax Return in accordance with the above provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(a)(i)_.

 

(ii) Purchaser will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of each Acquired Company for any Straddle Period (a
"Straddle Period Return"). No later than 30 days before the due date for
filing any Straddle Period Return that is an Income Tax Return (after giving
effect to any permitted extensions) and no later than 5 days before the due
date for filing any other Straddle Period Return (after giving effect to any
permitted extension), Purchaser will submit the Straddle Period Return to the
Shareholder Representative for review, comment, and approval by the
Shareholder Representative, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser will reflect any reasonable comments on any
Straddle Period Return relating to Income Taxes provided by the Shareholder
Representative no later than 15 days before the due date for filing such
Straddle Period Return (after giving effect to any permitted extensions) and
Purchaser will reflect any reasonable comments on any other Straddle Period
Return provided by the Shareholder Representative no later than 2 days before
the due date for filing such Straddle Period Return (after giving effect to
any permitted extensions). Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative will
attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding any Straddle
Period Return before the due date for filing. If Purchaser and the Shareholder
Representative do not resolve any dispute with respect to a Straddle Period
Return before the due date for filing, the dispute will be submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution (if practicable, at least 10
days before the filing due date, but in any event the submission to the
Independent Accounting Firm will be made sufficiently in advance of the filing
due date to permit a review by the Independent Accounting Firm). The
Independent Accounting Firms resolution will be

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 65

    

 conclusive and binding on all Parties. If for any reason the dispute is not
resolved at least two days before the Straddle Period Return is due, the
Straddle Period Return will be filed in the manner that Purchaser deems to be
correct. After the Independent Accounting Firms determination, if needed,
Purchaser will cause an amended Straddle Period Return to be filed in
accordance with such determination. The costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be borne equally by the Shareholders, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand.

(b) Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes. If any Acquired Company would be
obligated to file a Tax Return for a Post-Closing Tax Period that includes the
day prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Company will, to the extent
allowed by applicable Laws, close the taxable period of the Acquired Company
on the day prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any Straddle Period, the
Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period will be allocated between (A)
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (B) the Post-Closing Tax Period (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any pass-through entity in which an Acquired
Company holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate on the day
prior to the Closing Date) in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_.
Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes
attributable to a Straddle Period will be apportioned between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period, on the one hand, and the Post-Closing Tax Period, on the other
hand, by closing the books and records of the Acquired Company as though such
taxable period terminated as of the close of business on the day prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) will be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period, on the one
hand, and the Post-Closing Tax Period, on the other hand, in proportion to the
number of days in each such period. Property, ad valorem and similar Taxes
will be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period, on the one hand, and
the Post-Closing Tax Period, on the other hand, in proportion to the number of
days in each such period.

 

(c) Benefit of Deductions. The Company shall have the exclusive right to claim
on its Income Tax Returns for its final taxable year as a subchapter S
corporation all deductions and other compensation expenses arising from or
attributable to any Phantom Plan Payments or any expenses described in clause
(B) of the definition of Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, that are
paid or accrued by the Company prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Tax Refunds. Except to the extent included in the Closing Net Working
Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, any Tax
refunds and any amounts credited (in lieu of a refund or, if such credit is
not in lieu of a refund, to the extent such credit is in respect of
an overpayment of a Tax paid prior to the Closing Date by any Acquired
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period) against Tax (but in each case, only to
the extent such refund or credit is of a Tax paid prior to the Closing Date
by any Acquired Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period) that are actually
received in cash by any Acquired Company or Purchaser or are applied against
cash Taxes otherwise payable by any Acquired Company or Purchaser (excluding
any refund or credit attributable to any loss carry back from a period
beginning on or after the Closing Date or use of any loss or other attribute
arising on or after the Closing Date) will be for the account of
the Shareholders, and Purchaser will pay over to the Shareholders any such
refund or the amount of any such credit (net of any Tax, cost or expense
attributable to the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit) within 15
days after receipt in cash or application against cash

 Taxes payable. If there is a subsequent reduction by the applicable Tax
Authority of any amounts with respect to which a payment has been made
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.4(d)_, then the Shareholders (or the
Shareholder Representative, as applicable) will pay Purchaser an amount equal
to such reduction plus any interest or penalties imposed by the Tax Authority
with respect to such reduction.

(e) Amendments. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.4(a)_ or as required
pursuant to a settlement with or determination by a Tax Authority, Purchaser
will not amend, and will not permit any Acquired Company to amend, any Income
Tax Return that is a Pre-Closing Return or any election made in connection
with such Income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if the
amendment would have the effect of increasing the amount of any Tax liability
of any Shareholder.

(f) Tax Cooperation. Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative will
reasonably cooperate with each other in preparing Tax Returns related to the
Acquired Companies and will use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
all information, returns, books, records and documents relating to any
liabilities for Taxes relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the later
of the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation and extensions
thereof, or a final determination with respect to Taxes for such period and
will not destroy or otherwise dispose of any record relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without first providing the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.

(g) Post-Closing Audits.

 

(i) Purchaser will notify the Shareholder Representative in writing within 10
days after Purchaser or any Acquired Company receives notice of any official
inquiry, examination, contest, litigation, audit or proceeding (an "Audit")
regarding any Pre-Closing Return with respect to which any Shareholder may
have (A) a right to a refund under _Section_ __ _ 10.4(d)_ or (B) an
additional obligation for Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_; _provided_
, that the failure to so notify will not relieve the
Shareholder Representative or any Shareholder of its obligation hereunder,
except to the extent that such Person is actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure.

 

(ii) In the case of any Tax Audit of or with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies for any taxable period ending on or before the day prior to the
Closing Date (other than an Audit described in the second sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(g)(iv)_), the Shareholder Representative will have the
right to control such Audit; _provided_ , that the Shareholder Representative
will (1) provide Purchaser with a timely and reasonably detailed account of
each stage of such Audit, (2) consult with Purchaser before taking any
significant action in connection with such Audit, (3) permit Purchaser to
participate in such Audit and attend any meetings or conferences with the
relevant Tax Authority, and (4) not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Audit without obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(g)(ii)_, Purchaser will
have the exclusive right to control any Audit if (A) the Shareholder
Representative notifies Purchaser that the Shareholder Representative is
waiving its right to control such Audit or (B) the Shareholder Representative
fails to defend diligently such Audit.

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 67

    

(iii) In the case of an Audit of or with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies for any Straddle Period (other than an Audit described in _Section_
__ _ 10.4(g)(iv)_), Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control such
Audit; _provided_ , that if any Shareholder may have an additional obligation
for Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ as a result of the Audit, then
Purchaser will (1) provide the Shareholder Representative with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Audit, (2) consult with
the Shareholder Representative before taking any significant action in
connection with such Audit, (3) permit the Shareholder Representative to
participate in such Audit and attend any meetings or conferences with the
relevant Tax Authority, and (4) not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Audit that would materially and adversely affect the Shareholders without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iv) Purchaser will have the right, at its own expense, to exercise control at
any time over the handling, disposition and/or settlement of any issue raised
in any Audit regarding any Tax Return other than as described in _Section_ __
_ 10.4(g)(ii)_ (including the right to settle or otherwise terminate any
contest with respect thereto). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
but subject in all cases to _Section_ __ _ 10.4(e)_, Purchaser shall have the
exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither the Shareholder
Representative nor any Shareholder shall be entitled to participate in or have
any other rights in respect of, any Audit with respect to (A) any Tax Return
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies
after the Closing); or (B) any Tax Return of a consolidated, combined,
affiliated or unitary group that includes Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and the Shareholders each will be liable for and
will pay one-half of all sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording,
transfer or similar fees or taxes or governmental charges (together with any
interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed) as levied
by any taxing authority in connection with the Transactions. The Shareholder
Representative and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to
comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the
payment of such Taxes, and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
fullest extent possible under such Laws, the amount of any such Taxes payable
in connection herewith.

 

(i) IC-DISC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause CHI-
Domestic International Sales, Inc. to be liquidated for U.S. federal (and
applicable state) income Tax purposes at least three days prior to the
Closing.

 

(j) Tax Treatment. For U.S. federal (and applicable state) income Tax
purposes, the Parties intend that the acquisition of the Shares by Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement be treated as a sale of stock of the Company and
not as a sale of assets of any Acquired Company. No Party will take any action
to cause the acquisition of the Shares to be treated as a sale of assets of
any Company and all of the Parties will report the Transactions consistently
with this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(j)_ for U.S. federal (and applicable state)
income Tax purposes.

10.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors; Exculpation of Liability.

 

(a) For a period of six years after Closing, Purchaser will not permit any
Acquired Company to amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in their
respective Organizational Documents or indemnification agreements relating to
exculpation or indemnification of former officers and directors holding office
on or before the Closing Date for acts or omissions occurring on or before
the Closing Date, it being the Parties intent that the officers and
directors of each Acquired Company on or before the Closing Date will continue
to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification in respect of such acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Closing to the greatest extent permitted
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, as applicable for six
years after Closing, except as required by Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or shall cause the Company
to obtain (at Purchasers sole expense) a "tail" insurance policy to become
effective at the Closing with a claims period of six years following the
Closing with respect to directors and officers liability insurance covering
each person covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy as in effect on the Execution Date (the "Existing DandO
Policy") for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing; _provided_ that
in no event shall Purchaser be required to pay, with respect to the entire
six-year period following the Closing, premiums for insurance under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_ that in the aggregate exceed 300% of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company in 2017 under the Existing DandO Policy (which
premiums for such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company
to be the amount set forth on __Schedule 10.5__ ); _provided_ _further_ that
Purchaser shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with
respect to the entire six-year period following the Closing, as may be
obtained for such 300% amount.

 

(c) The obligations of Purchaser under this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ will not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Person to whom this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ applies without the
prior written consent of the affected Person, it being expressly agreed that
each such Person to whom this  _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ applies is an express
third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_.

10.6 Obligations to Continuing Employees.

(a) After Closing, Purchaser will cause the Acquired Companies to honor and
satisfy all of their respective obligations and liabilities with respect to
any Benefit Plan existing as of Closing and disclosed on the Disclosure
Schedule (each a "Disclosed Benefit Plan") in accordance with their respective
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Acquired Company will be required to
continue any Benefit Plan after Closing, and any Benefit Plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. To the extent
that any Disclosed Benefit Plan (other than a Benefit Plan that is a retiree
welfare plan) is terminated or amended after Closing and before the first
anniversary of Closing so as to eliminate the benefits that are being provided
with respect to participants thereunder, Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange for each employee who is then a participant in
such terminated or

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 69

    

 amended Disclosed Benefit Plan to participate in a similar benefit plan of
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (a "Purchaser Benefit Plan") from the date
of such termination or amendment until the first anniversary of Closing, to
the extent (and on the terms that) similarly situated employees of Purchaser
or its Affiliates participate in the Purchaser Benefit Plan, in accordance
with the eligibility criteria thereof and subject to the required approval of
the applicable insurance provider; _provided_ that:

(i) The participant will receive full credit for years of service performed
with the Acquired Companies before Closing for all purposes for which service
was recognized under the applicable Disclosed Benefit Plan, including
recognition of service for eligibility, vesting (including acceleration
thereof pursuant to the terms of the applicable Disclosed Benefit Plan),
entitlement to commence benefits and, to the extent not duplicative of
benefits received under the Disclosed Benefit Plan, the amount of benefits;
_provided_  that such credit shall not apply for purposes of retiree welfare
or defined benefit pension plans;

(ii) Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and
all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not
apply to a pre-existing condition under the applicable Disclosed Benefit
Plan) under any group health plans to be waived with respect to the
participant and his or her eligible dependents; and

 

(iii) Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Purchaser Benefit Plans that are group welfare plans to provide
the participant with credit towards any applicable deductibles, co-payments
and similar exclusions for expenses incurred and paid under the applicable
Disclosed Benefit Plan before Closing for the applicable plan year as if the
amounts had been paid in accordance with the Purchaser Benefit Plan.

(b) No provision in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ will: (i) create any third
party beneficiary or other rights in any current or former director, officer,
employee, or independent contractor (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
of any Acquired Company or any other Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; (ii) constitute or create an
employment agreement; or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Purchaser, any
Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

10.7 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, before or concurrently with Closing, the applicable Acquired
Company will, without additional consideration, transfer to the respective
owners the property listed on  _Schedule_ __ _ 10.7_ (the "Excluded
Assets").

10.8 Investigation; No Reliance by Purchaser. Purchaser acknowledges that it
and its Agents have undertaken an independent investigation of the business,
assets, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Acquired
Companies. In connection with that investigation, Purchaser and its Agents
have received or may receive from or on behalf of the Shareholders or the
Acquired Companies certain estimates, forecasts, plans and financial
projections (whether in written, electronic, or oral form and including in any
management presentation, electronic data room, management meetings or
otherwise) ("Forward-Looking Statements"). Purchaser, for itself and its
Affiliates, knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and

 expressly acknowledges and agrees that, except to the extent set forth in
any representations and warranties set forth in _Article_ __ _ 6_ and 
_Article_ __ _ 7_ or in the Transaction Documents: (a) the Forward-Looking
Statements have been or will be provided solely for Purchasers convenience to
facilitate its own independent investigation of the Acquired Companies; and
(b) there are uncertainties inherent in making Forward-Looking Statements.
Except to the extent otherwise constituting Fraud, or constituting a breach of
or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in  _Article_ __ _ 6_
or _Article_ __ _ 7_ or in the Transaction Documents, none of the
Shareholders or the Company will be subject to any Liability to Purchaser or
any other Person (to the extent claiming by, through or under Purchaser)
resulting from the distribution to Purchaser of Forward-Looking Statements.

defense of any Action related to this Agreement or the Transactions
will violate this _Section_ __ _ 10.15_; _provided_ , _further_ , that
nothing in this Agreement prevents a Party from providing truthful information
in response to a lawfully issued subpoena or court order or to
communicate with any Government Authority or otherwise participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Authority.

 

10.16 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) with such

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the time, scope, geographic area and other
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ have been specifically negotiated
by sophisticated commercial parties and agree that all such provisions are
reasonable under the circumstances of the purchase and sale of the Shares and
of the Transactions. Each Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the terms
of this _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ (i) are reasonable in light of all of the
circumstances, (ii) are sufficiently limited to protect the legitimate
interests of Purchaser and its Affiliates, (iii) impose no undue hardship on
any Shareholder and (iv) are not injurious to the public. Each Shareholder
acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants and other agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ are an essential part of this
Agreement and the Transactions, constitute a material inducement to
Purchasers entering into and performing its obligations under this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents, are an essential part of Purchasers
willingness to pay the Consideration. Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 14.7_,
it is the intention of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.16_ is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by Law,
or is in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such
provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the
extent such provision would then be valid or enforceable under Law, such
provision shall be construed and interpreted or reformed to provide for a
restriction or covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions as shall be valid and enforceable under Law.

ARTICLE 11

 

REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT

 

11.1 Survival.

(a) None of the representations or warranties made by the Company or any
Shareholder in this Agreement or any Transaction Document will survive Closin
_g_ , except that the Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties contained in  _Section_ __ _ 6.23_ shall survive the Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect until 60 days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)_, if at any time prior to the expiration date
referred to in the preceding sentence, Purchaser delivers a written notice to
the Shareholder Representative in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)_,
as applicable, alleging the existence of an inaccuracy or breach of a
Fundamental Representation or a representation or warranty contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6.23_ and asserting a potential claim for recovery based on
such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then such representation or warranty shall
survive as to such claim until such time as such claim is fully

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 75

    

 and finally resolved. None of the representations or warranties made by the
Purchaser in this Agreement or any Transaction Document will survive Closin
_g_ , except that the representations or warranties made by Purchaser in
_Sections 5.1_ through _5.7_ and _Sections_ _5.9_ and _5.13_ of this Agreement
and in the other Purchaser Transaction Documents will survive Closing for a
period of 12 months.

 

(b) None of the covenants or other agreements in this Agreement will survive
the Closing other than those that, by their terms, contemplate performance,
in whole or in part, after the Closing (the "Surviving Covenants"). Each
Surviving Covenant will survive Closing pursuant to its terms.

 

11.2 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article_
__ _ 11_, from and after the Closing, each of the Shareholders (each
Shareholder, an "Indemnifying Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnifying
Parties") agrees to (on a several, but not joint basis) indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, (including the Acquired Companies),
their respective directors, officers and employees, and their respective
successors and assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from and against
any and all Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out
of or resulting from (or constituting) any (i) breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representations, (ii) breach by the Company (prior to Closing) or
breach by the Shareholder Representative or any of the Shareholders (at any
time), of the Surviving Covenants, (iii) Excluded Taxes and (iv) subject to
the limitations of _Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)(iii)_ and except to the extent
included in Company Transaction Expenses, Excluded Environmental Liabilities.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties expressly acknowledge that the Damages
as to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 11_ may consist of Damages arising from
inter-Party (i.e., between the Parties) claims and/or Damages arising from
Third-Party Claims (as defined below) asserted against the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties. For purposes of this  _Article_ __ _ 11_, the existence
of any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement and the amount of any Damages arising from such breach or
inaccuracy shall be determined without reference to the terms "material"
"Material Adverse Effect" "material adverse effect" or other similar
qualification as to materiality contained or incorporated into such
representation or warranty.

 

11.3 Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) In the event of any claim or demand subject to indemnification under this
_Article_ __ _ 11_ made by any third party against any Purchaser Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim"), Purchaser shall deliver notice thereof to the
Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties), as soon as
reasonably practicable after such Purchaser Indemnified Party receives notice
of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that no delay or failure on the part
of Purchaser in notifying the Shareholder Representative shall relieve the
Indemnifying Parties from their obligations hereunder unless the Indemnifying
Parties are actually prejudiced thereby (and then solely to the extent of such
prejudice). To the extent then reasonably known and available to Purchaser,
such notice must describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and
indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible) of
the related Damages that have been or may be suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 76

    

(b) The Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties shall
have the right, upon written notice to the Purchaser within thirty (30) days
of receipt of notice from the Purchaser of the commencement of such Third
Party Claim (which notice shall include an acknowledgement by the Shareholder
Representative that such Third Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder), to
assume the defense thereof at the sole expense of the Shareholder
Representative and the Indemnifying Parties with counsel selected by the
Shareholder Representative and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser; _provided_
that in no event shall any Purchaser Indemnified Party enter into any
settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Shareholder Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), unless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties unconditionally release
the Indemnifying Parties from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing of this _Section_ __ _ 11.3(b)_, the
Shareholder Representative shall not have the right to assume control of such
defense if the Third Party Claim of which the Shareholder Representative seeks
to assume control (i) seeks non-monetary relief in any material respect, (ii)
involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, (iii) involves a claim which,
if adversely, determined, would be reasonably expected, in the good faith
judgment of the Purchaser, to establish a precedent, custom or practice
adverse in any material respect to the continuing business interests or
prospects of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, (iv) seeks Damages that
Purchaser reasonably believes will be greater than the remaining amount of
the Shareholders maximum liability under _Section_ __ _ 11.4(a)_, (v)
involves a claim that the Shareholder Representative failed or is failing to
actively and diligently defend or (vi) involves an actual or potential
conflict of interest, in the reasonable judgment of outside legal counsel of
Purchaser, that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent
the Shareholders and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (each of the
foregoing, an "Exception Claim"). If the Shareholder Representative assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with the Shareholder Representative in such defense. If
the Shareholder Representative assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Shareholder Representative shall not, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (A) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party, (B) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (C)
imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on any Purchaser
Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will be fully indemnified and held harmless
hereunder. In the event that the Shareholder Representative fails to elect to
assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in the manner set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.3(b)_ or such Third Party Claim is or at any
time becomes, an Exception Claim, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may, at
the Shareholder Representatives cost and expense (subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article_ __ _ 11_), defend against the Third Party Claim
in any manner it may deem reasonably appropriate; _provided_ , that, the
Shareholder Representative shall nonetheless have the right to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise to the Purchaser Indemnified
Partys claim for indemnification at the Shareholder Representatives sole
cost and expense; and _provided_ , _further_ that the Purchaser Indemnified
Party may not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Shareholder Representative (such consent not to

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 77

    

 be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Shareholder
Representative is controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 11.3(b)_, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall nonetheless have the right to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim giving rise to the Purchaser Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification with counsel of its choosing at the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties sole cost and expense.

(c) The above provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ shall not apply to
any Third Party Claim or Audit in respect of Taxes.

11.4 Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Article_ __ _ 11_:

(a) Except in the case of Fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement, in
no event will any Indemnifying Party be liable for any Damages incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of breaches or inaccuracies of the
representations and warranties, including the Fundamental Representations, in
an aggregate amount in excess of the portion of the Consideration actually
received by the applicable breaching Indemnifying Party. In no event will any
Shareholder be liable for any Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties arising out of breaches or inaccuracies of a representation or
warranty of any other Shareholder set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement.

 

(b) Except in the case of Fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement, in no
event will any Indemnifying Party be liable to indemnify any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for any single claim for Excluded Taxes that arises out of
or relates to a breach of or inaccuracy in _Section_ __ _ 6.23_ involving
Damages of $10,000 or less (provided that for purposes of this  _Section_ __
_ 11.4(b)_, any series of related claims, or set of claims arising out of
materially the same facts and circumstances, shall be treated as a single
claim subject to a single $10,000 threshold).

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of this Agreement,
Damages shall be calculated based on the amount of Damages that remain after
deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds (including proceeds received under
the RandW Insurance Policy) to the extent actually received by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party with respect thereto (net of any reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds
and any direct Taxes imposed or payable in respect thereof). The Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover on
account of Damages under applicable insurance policies (including the RandW
Insurance Policy); ___provided_ , _however_ , that a Purchaser Indemnified
Party will not be required to file any suit or initiate any legal proceeding
to recover under any applicable insurance policy. If the Purchaser Indemnified
Party is unable to recover Damages from an insurance company (including under
the RandW Insurance Policy) after using its commercially reasonable efforts to
recover those Damages and notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it
chooses not to file suit or initiate a legal proceeding against such insurance
company to recover such Damages, then at the option of the Indemnifying Party
and upon written notice to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party may at its own cost and expense file suit or initiate a legal proceeding
against such insurance company to recover those Damages with the reasonable
assistance from the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party, and, if necessary,
in the name of the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party. If the

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 78

    

 Indemnifying Party files suit or initiates a legal proceeding against such
insurance company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to (i) direct the management and
administration of the claim in its sole discretion and (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party has paid the full amount of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties Damages, any recovery from the insurance company in respect of a
settlement of such claim or judgment or award in such claim proceeding.

11.5 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy
(other than to the extent set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.3_), would occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform any provision of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.
Except as otherwise provided herein, including to the extent set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 12.3_ with respect to the Termination Fee or in _Section_ __ _
11.6_, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this
Agreement, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

11.6 Exclusive Remedy; Limitation of Liability.

 

(a) Exclusivity of Remedy. From and after the Closing, except for any remedy
based upon Fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement, the rights and
obligations of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties set forth in this _Article_
__ _ 11_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to a breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Fundamental
Representations, the Surviving Covenants of the Shareholders, or for Damages
in respect of Excluded Taxes.

(b) Purchaser has purchased the RandW Insurance Policy to insure against the
risk that any representations or warranties made by the Company or the
Shareholders in this Agreement may be inaccurate or incomplete. Accordingly,
Purchaser, for itself and the other Purchaser Parties, expressly
acknowledges, agrees and understands that, except as otherwise provided in
this _Article_ __ _ 11_ with respect to Fundamental Representations made by
the Company or Fundamental Representations made by the Shareholders, the
representations and warranties made by the Company and contained in _Section_
__ _ 6.23_ and Excluded Taxes, (i) their sole and exclusive remedy and source
of recovery for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by the Company or any Shareholder in this Agreement will be against the
RandW Insurance Policy, regardless of whether any proceeds under the RandW
Insurance Policy are actually available to Purchaser for such breach or
inaccuracy, (ii) they cannot assert against the Shareholders any claim for
breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 79

    

 Transaction Documents, and (iii) they will have no recourse against any
Shareholder for Damages or otherwise, and no Shareholder will be liable or
otherwise have any obligation to Purchaser, as a result of any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Company or any
Shareholder in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

 

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, Purchaser
hereby waives, for itself and the other Purchaser Parties, to the fullest
extent permitted under law, all Actions or Damages for breach by the Company
or any Shareholder of this Agreement or, solely with respect to the
Shareholders and not in respect of any third parties, otherwise arising out of
the Transactions, except as otherwise provided in this _Article_ __ _ 11_
with respect to Fundamental Representations made by the Company or Fundamental
Representations made by the Shareholders, the representations and warranties
made by the Company and contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.23_, Excluded Taxes,
and the Surviving Covenants, whether arising at common law, in equity or
otherwise, whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise, that any Purchaser
Party had, has or may have against any Shareholder, his, her, or its
Affiliates, and each of their respective Agents; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall in no way limit Purchasers rights with respect to or
under the RandW Insurance Policy. 

(d) Purchaser, for itself and the other Purchaser Parties, knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledges and agrees that no
Purchaser Party may avoid the acknowledgments, agreements, understanding,
waivers and other limitations on liability in this _Article_ __ _ 11_ by (i)
seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory
of liability, all of which are hereby waived, or (ii) asserting or threatening
any claim against any Person that is not a Party (or a successor to a Party)
for breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

(e) Nothing in this _Article_ __ _ 11_ will limit (i) Purchasers right to
seek and obtain (A) any equitable relief to which Purchaser is entitled if
any Shareholder breaches or threatens to breach a covenant under this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or (B) any remedy on account of
Fraud, (ii) Purchasers rights under the RandW Insurance Policy, or (iii) in
any way any Shareholders rights or remedies with respect to any breach or
non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement, or obligations, in each case, of
Purchaser in this Agreement or any Transaction Document.

11.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties agree to treat, for U.S. federal income and other
applicable Tax purposes, any payment pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 11_ as
an adjustment to the Consideration.

ARTICLE 12

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time before Closing
only by:

(a) The Parties upon their mutual written consent.

(b) Purchaser by giving written notice to the Company at any time (i) (A) in
the event the Company or a Shareholder has breached or failed to perform any
covenant

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 80

    

 contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result
in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ or there
exists a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or the
Shareholders, which breach would result in the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ and (B) such breach or failure to perform
cannot be cured or, if capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 days
after Purchaser has notified the Company of the breach or failure to perform
(or, if sooner, by the Termination Date) or (ii) if Closing has not occurred
on or prior to the Termination Date (unless the failure of the Closing to
occur results primarily from or is primarily caused by Purchaser breaching any
obligation, representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).

 

(c) The Company by giving written notice to Purchaser at any time (i) (A) in
the event Purchaser has breached or failed to perform any covenant contained
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ or there exists a
breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser, which breach would
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ and
(B) such breach or failure to perform cannot be cured, or, if capable of being
cured, is not cured within 30 days after the Company has notified Purchaser
of the breach or failure to perform (or, if sooner, by the Termination Date),
or (ii) if Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Termination Date
(unless the failure of the Closing to occur results primarily from or
is primarily caused by the Company or any Shareholder breaching any
obligation, representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).

 

(d) The Company or Purchaser by giving written notice to the other Party if an
Order shall have been entered permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions and such Order
shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(d)_
shall have complied with its obligations under _Sections_ __ _ 8.4_ and 8.6.

 

12.2 Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.1_ will terminate all obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement, without liability of any Party to any other Party, except for
the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement (which will survive in
accordance with its terms),  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, this _Section_ __ _
12.2_, and _Section_ __ _ 12.3_, except that nothing herein will relieve any
Party from any liability for Fraud.

 

12.3 Termination Fee.

 

(a) If:

(i) (A) all conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than (1) conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied,
and are capable of being satisfied, at Closing if the Closing were to occur at
the time of the relevant termination or (2) any condition that was not
satisfied as a result of the breach of, or default under, this Agreement by
Purchaser) and (B) the Shareholder Representative and the Company have
irrevocably confirmed in writing that the Shareholders and the Company are
ready, willing, and able to consummate the Closing; and

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 81

    

(ii) (A) the Company has terminated this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 12.1(c)_ or (B) Purchaser has terminated this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(b)_ at a time when the Company had the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)_;

then, Purchaser will promptly, but in any event within two Business Days of
the date of termination, pay $20,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") to the
Company as directed in writing by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion and in no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the
Termination Fee in the event the Closing is consummated.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 12.3_ are an integral part of this Agreement and the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the Company and Purchaser would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to pay the
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)_, then if to obtain
payment from Purchaser, the Company commences an Action that results in a
final judgment against Purchaser for the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _
12.3_ or any portion thereof, Purchaser will pay to the Company its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with that Action.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of
accurately determining actual Damages with respect to the foregoing in any of
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable under this
Agreement, (i) the amount of the Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 12.3_ constitutes a reasonable estimate of the monetary Damages that
will be suffered by the Company by reason of breach or termination of this
Agreement in those circumstances, and (ii) the receipt of the Termination Fee
shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all Damages suffered or
incurred by the Shareholders and the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates and any such payment of the Termination Fee by or on behalf of
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.3_, will be in full and
complete satisfaction of any and all monetary Damages of the Company and the
Seller Related Parties arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
Transactions (including any breach by Purchaser), the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the Transactions, and any claims or
actions under applicable Law arising out of any breach, termination or failure
and (iii) none of the Shareholders or the Company or any of their Affiliates
or any other Person shall be entitled to recover, individually or in the
aggregate, any amount in excess of the Termination Fee or bring or maintain
any Action against any Purchaser Related Party arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions (or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination
(whether at law, in equity, contract, tort or otherwise).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys
right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Termination Fee
from Purchaser shall, in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
payable, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Related Parties
against Purchaser and the Purchaser Related Parties for any Damages suffered
as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a
breach or failure on the part of Purchaser to perform hereunder or otherwise
in circumstances where the payment of the Termination Fee is applicable, and
upon payment of the Termination Fee Purchaser and the Purchaser Related
Parties shall have no further liability or obligation to the Seller Related
Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 82

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the
Company, the Shareholders, their respective Affiliates and any other Seller
Related Party (other than Purchaser) hereby (i) waives any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source and any Investor in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Convertible Notes Financing, as
applicable, any other document related thereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or
otherwise) and (ii) agrees not to commence any action (on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) or
proceeding against any Debt Financing Source or Investor in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or Convertible Notes Financing, as
applicable, any other document related thereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise), and to
cause any such action or proceeding to be dismissed or otherwise terminated.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is
acknowledged and agreed that no Debt Financing Source or Investor shall have
any liability for any claims or damages to the Company, the Shareholders,
their respective Affiliates and any other Seller Related Party in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or Convertible Notes Financing, as
applicable, any other document related thereto or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _
12.3(e)_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Debt
Financing Source, its Affiliates, each Investor, its Affiliates and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended
to be an express third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 12.3(e)_.

ARTICLE 13

 

MATTERS RELATING TO THE SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

 

13.1 Appointment of the Shareholder Representative. Each Shareholder
irrevocably appoints the Shareholder Representative as the Shareholders true
and lawful attorney in fact and agent, with full power of substitution or re-
substitution, to act on behalf of the Shareholder with respect to the transfer
of the Shares owned by the Shareholder to Purchaser in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, and to act on behalf of the
Shareholder in any litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement, to do
or refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents as the Shareholder Representative will deem necessary or appropriate
in connection with the Transactions, including the power to:

 

(a) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements, stock
powers, certificates, statements, notices and other documents that the
Shareholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions, including any amendments to this
Agreement;

 

(b) interpret the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents to be executed and delivered by Shareholder in connection with this
Agreement;

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 83

    

(c) receive funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds;

 

(d) receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Shareholder and apply
those funds in payment for those expenses;

 

(e) make any determinations and settle any matters in connection with the
adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price in  _Article_ __ _ 3_, any other
matters relating to any amounts to be received by such Shareholder under this
Agreement, and any other dispute under this Agreement;

 

(f) give and receive notices and communications;

 

(g) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Shareholder that the Shareholder Representative deems necessary
or appropriate in her sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement as fully and completely as the Shareholder could do if personally
present; and

 

(h) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement.

 

The appointment of the Shareholder Representative is coupled with an interest
and is irrevocable and shall survive the Closing, and Purchaser, the Company
and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry,
upon any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Shareholder Representative
in all matters referred to herein, all of which shall be binding on the
Shareholders. All notices required to be made or delivered by Purchaser to
the Shareholders described above in this _Section_ __ _ 13.1_ will be made to
the Shareholder Representative for the benefit of the Shareholders and will
discharge in full all notice requirements of Purchaser to the Shareholders
with respect thereto. The Shareholder Representative will promptly provide all
Shareholders with copies of all such notices. The Shareholders confirm all
that the Shareholder Representative will do or cause to be done by virtue of
her appointment as the representative of the Shareholders under this
Agreement. The Shareholder Representative will act for the Shareholders on all
of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Shareholder
Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Shareholders and
consistent with the obligations of the Shareholders under this Agreement, but
the Shareholder Representative will not be responsible to any Shareholder for
any loss or Damages that any Shareholder may suffer by the performance of the
Shareholder Representatives duties under this Agreement, other than loss or
Damages arising from intentional violations of Law or gross negligence in the
performance of such duties under this Agreement. The Shareholder
Representative will not have any duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities will be read into this
Agreement or will otherwise exist against the Shareholder Representative.

13.2 Reliance by the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder
Representative will be entitled to rely, and will be fully protected in
relying, upon any statements furnished to her by any Shareholder, Purchaser or
the Company, or any other evidence reasonably deemed by the Shareholder
Representative to be reliable, and the Shareholder Representative will be
entitled

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 84

    

 to act on the advice of counsel selected by the Shareholder Representative.
The Shareholder Representative will be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under this Agreement unless she has received such advice
or concurrence of any Shareholder as she deems appropriate or she has been
expressly indemnified to her satisfaction by the Shareholders (severally as to
each Shareholder only and not jointly as to or with any other Shareholder)
according to their respective Pro Rata Shares against any and all Liability
and expense that the Shareholder Representative may incur by reason of taking
or continuing to take any such action.

 

13.3 Expenses of the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder
Representative is entitled to retain counsel and to incur expenses (including
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) as the Shareholder
Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with
performing her obligations under this Agreement, and all fees and expenses so
incurred by the Shareholder Representative will be borne by the Shareholders
(severally as to each Shareholder only and not jointly as to or with any other
Shareholder) according to their respective Pro Rata Shares.

 

13.4 Substitute Shareholder Representative. If the individual appointed
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.1_ dies, becomes disabled, resigns or
otherwise becomes unable to fulfill her responsibilities as agent of the
Shareholders, then the Shareholders whose aggregate Pro Rata Shares exceeds
50.0% will, as soon as practicable (and in any event within 5 Business Days)
and with Purchasers written approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), appoint a successor Shareholder
Representative for the Shareholders. The Shareholder Representative may resign
at any time by written notice to Purchaser and the Shareholders. All power,
authority, rights and privileges conferred in this Agreement to the initial
Shareholder Representative will apply to any successor Shareholder
Representative.

 

13.5 Reliance by Purchaser. Purchaser may rely on the appointment and
authority of the Shareholder Representative granted pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ 13_ until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a
successor Shareholder Representative made in accordance with _Section_ __ _
13.4_. In so doing, Purchaser will be entitled to deal exclusively with and
may rely conclusively (without further evidence whatsoever) on any and all
actions taken by, writings delivered by, and decisions of the Shareholder
Representative on any matter relating to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents.

14.2 Payments. All payments made to any Party, or on behalf of any Party,
under this Agreement will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by that Party in writing.

14.3 Entire Agreement.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Reciprocal
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 27, 2018, entered into Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to subject matter set forth herein and therein
and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to that subject matter.

(b) If Purchaser is not a signatory to the Confidentiality Agreement,
Purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement as fully as if Purchaser were a signatory thereto. In the event of
any inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement and those in the
Transaction Documents, the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

(c) Each appendix, schedule (including the _Disclosure Schedule_ and the
_Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ), exhibit or other document attached to this
Agreement is expressly made a part of this Agreement.

 

14.4 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented, and
a provision of this Agreement may be waived, only if the amendment,
supplement or waiver is in writing and signed by all the Parties, in the case
of an amendment or supplement, or by the Party against whom the waiver is to
be effective, in the case of a waiver. No waiver by any Party will operate or
be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not
expressly identified in a written waiver, whether of a similar or different
character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure or
delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 87

    

 privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of _Sections_
__ _ 12.3_, _14.6_ , _14.10(a)_ , _14.10(c)_ , _14.10(d)_ , _14.10(e)_ ,
_14.10(f)_ , _14.12_ , and this  _Section_ __ _ 14.14_ (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of such
Sections) shall not be amended in any manner adverse to the Debt Financing
Sources or Investors, as applicable, without the prior written consent of such
Debt Financing Sources or Investors, as applicable.

 

14.5 Benefits; Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Neither this Agreement nor the obligations of any Party under this
Agreement will be assignable or transferable by the Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , that (a) before or
contemporaneously with Closing, Purchaser may merge into any wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, with such subsidiary to be the survivor of such merger
and to be substituted for all purposes of this Agreement as "Purchaser", (b)
Purchaser and, after Closing, the Company will each have the right to assign
any of its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates and to any
purchaser of a material portion of its assets, so long as the Party remains
liable for its Affiliates or purchasers obligations under this Agreement and
(c) Purchaser and, after Closing, the Company may each assign its rights under
this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender or lenders
(including any agent for any the lender or lenders) providing financing to
Purchaser in connection with the Transactions, or to any assignee or assignees
of the lender, lenders or agent.

 

14.6 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as provided in (a) _ Section_ __ _
10.5(c)_ and (b) _ Sections_ __ _ 12.3_, _14.4_ , _14.10(a)_ , _14.10(c)_ ,
_14.10(d)_ , _14.10(e)_ , _14.10(f)_ , _14.12_ , and this _Section_ __ _
14.6_ with respect to the Debt Financing Sources and Investors, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or will be interpreted to
confer upon any Person other than the Parties (and, where applicable, Parent)
any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim.

 

14.7 Severability. If any court, arbitrator, or arbitration panel finds any
provision of this Agreement to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, that
provision will be void to the extent it is contrary to applicable Law.
However, that finding will not affect the validity of any other provision of
this Agreement, and the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect unless enforcement of this Agreement without the invalidated
provision would be grossly inequitable under all of the circumstances or would
frustrate the primary purposes of this Agreement. Alternatively, if a court,
arbitrator, or arbitration panel determines that any provision of this
Agreement is not enforceable as expressly written, it is the intention of the
Parties that those provisions be modified by the court, arbitrator, or
arbitration panel only as is necessary for them to be enforceable.

14.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, the Parties will bear their
own respective expenses (including all compensation and expenses of counsel,
financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent accountants)
incurred in connection with preparing and executing this Agreement and
consummating the Transactions, it being agreed that fees and expenses of the

 



STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PAGE 88

    

 Shareholders and the Acquired Companies incurred prior to or in connection
with the Closing shall be the Shareholders responsibility and not that of any
Acquired Company, except to the extent they are included as Company
Transaction Expenses in reduction of the Cash Purchase Price.

14.9 Purchasers Review(i) . Purchaser has reviewed and has had access to all
documents, records and information that it desired to review, and has had the
opportunity to ask questions, and has received sufficient answers, in
connection with its decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions. In connection with executing and delivering this Agreement
and consummating the Transactions, Purchaser has not relied on, and Purchaser
expressly waives and releases the Company and each Shareholder from any
Liability for any claims (excluding Fraud) relating to or arising from, any
representation, warranty, statement, advice, document, projection, or other
information of any type (including the Information Packet and any forward-
looking statements) provided by any Shareholder, the Company or their
respective Affiliates or any of their representatives, except for those
representations and warranties of the Company and the Shareholder expressly
set forth in  _Article_ __ _ 6_ and _Article_ __ _ 7_ or in any Transaction
Document, or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement. In deciding
to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions, Purchaser has
relied solely on its own knowledge, investigation, judgment and analysis (and
that of its Agents) and not on any disclosure or representation made by, or
any duty to disclose on the part of, any Shareholder, Acquired Company, or any
of their respective Agents, other than the express representations and
warranties of the Company and the Shareholder set forth in _Article_ __ _ 6_
and _Article_ __ _ 7_ or in any Transaction Document or any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

14.10 Governing Law; Litigation Expenses; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflicting provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York to be applied. In furtherance of the foregoing, the internal
laws of the State of New York will control the interpretation and
construction of this Agreement, even if under New Yorks choice of law or
conflict of law analysis, the substantive laws of another jurisdiction would
ordinarily apply.

 

(b) If suit, action or other proceeding is commenced to enforce, interpret or
rescind this Agreement, or any provision hereof, including any proceeding
pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 11_, the prevailing Party will be entitled to
recover, in addition to any other relief to which the Party may be entitled,
its reasonable attorneys fees, expert witness fees, costs of suit and
expenses in such proceeding and any appeal therefrom.

(c) ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR BASED ON

SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN

or Investors in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of, relating to or based upon the Financing,
the Commitment Letters or the other Financing Agreements or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
in New York County, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the federal courts located in the Southern
District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) submits for itself
and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts, (iii) agrees that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in
_Section_ __ _ 14.1_ shall be effective service of process against it for any
such action brought in any such court, (iv) waives and hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such
court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _
14.10(d)_ shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source and Investor.

(e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, EACH SELLER RELATED PARTY
AND EACH OTHER PARTY HERETO, HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT
MAY ARISE OUT OF, RELATE TO OR BE BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, ANY TRANSACTION
DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH SELLER RELATED PARTY AND EACH PARTY HERETO, HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY
AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR BASED UPON
THE FINANCING, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR
THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, INCLUDING ANY SUIT, ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE OR INVESTOR.

Agreement under the terms thereof, none of the Parties, nor any of their
