Period__ "), provided that if the Closing does not occur during the
Pending Judgment Period with respect to a Pending Judgment Notice, the

transferred more than once or (ii) any duplication of such asset is required.
The fact that a Purchased Asset may not be included under one clause of
this Section 2.4 does not imply that it is not intended to be included under
another clause of this Section 2.4.

contained herein, any and all of each Sellers right, title and interest in
any asset not included in Purchased Assets, including all cash derived from

"), shall be specifically excluded from, and shall not constitute, Purchased
Assets. The parties acknowledge and agree that neither Purchaser nor any of
its Subsidiaries will acquire or be permitted to retain any direct or indirect

and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties further
acknowledge and agree that the Seller Benefit Plans (other than the Assumed

-18 Section 2.6 _Assumed Liabilities._ Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall assume and agree to discharge
or perform all Liabilities to the extent Relating to the Business or resulting
from, caused by, or arising out of the ownership, occupancy, use, control or

excluding the Retained Liabilities, including all of the Liabilities listed

extent reflected as a current Liability on the Post-Closing Statement as
finally adjusted pursuant to Section 2.9.

A single Liability may fall within more than one of clauses (a) through (j)
in this Section 2.6; such fact does not imply that (i) such Liability shall be
transferred more than once or (ii) any

 



-19  duplication of such Liability is required. The fact that a Liability may not
be included under one clause of this Section 2.6 does not imply that it is not
intended to be included under another clause of this Section 2.6.

Section 2.7 _Retained Liabilities._ Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
2.6, each Seller shall retain, and Purchaser shall not assume, any and all of
the following Liabilities of each Seller Relating to the Business or relating
to the Purchased Assets (other than the Assumed Liabilities) and any and

Contracts that relate to or arise out of the period prior to the Closing Date

respect to an event or period prior to the Closing Date and any and all
Liabilities relating to or arising out of any Sellers continued obligations
under the Transferred Contracts with respect to an event or period after the
Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, not including the Liabilities
relating to or arising out of the portion of any Transferred Contract that
relate to or arise out of the period beginning on the Closing Date for which
the benefits and burdens are being provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.12 (except to the extent such Liabilities are Retained Environmental

including, without limitation, limited warranty deeds and all forms required

applicable federal, state, county, municipal and other transfer taxes with
respect to the transactions set forth herein, in each case, substantially in

the Title Company to issue the Owners Title Policy.

Section 2.9 _Working Capital; Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) Section
2.9(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth, for illustrative
purposes only, a calculation of the net working capital of the Business as of
the most recent Business Financial Statement (the " _ _Sample Closing
Statement__ "), prepared and calculated in accordance with the methodologies,
procedures, assumptions and estimates described in Section 2.9(a)(ii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _ _Closing Statement Methodologies__ ").

 

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent Seller
shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a closing statement
(the " _ _Closing Statement__ ") setting forth a good faith estimate of the
Adjustment Amount as of the Post-Closing Measurement Time (such estimate, the
" _ _Estimated Adjustment Amount__ ") and the calculation of

 



-22  such Estimated Adjustment Amount, including an estimate of the Closing
Working Capital (estimated as of the Post-Closing Measurement Time), together
with a certification of a senior officer of Parent Seller that (i) the
Closing Statement was (A) estimated in good faith and based upon the books and
records of Sellers and (B) prepared and calculated in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement. The Closing Statement shall be in the form of
the Sample Closing Statement and prepared and calculated in accordance with
the Closing Statement Methodologies; _provided,_ _however_ , that assets newly
acquired and liabilities newly incurred following the date of the Sample
Closing Statement that cannot be appropriately placed in line items in the
Sample Closing Statement, but that constitute Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, will be included in the Closing Statement in accordance with the
Closing Statement Methodologies. Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing
through the date that the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding in
accordance with this Section 2.9, it will not take any actions with respect to
any accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Sample
Closing Statement or the Closing Statement is based, or on which the Post-
Closing Statement is to be based, that are materially inconsistent with the
ordinary course and past practice of the Business (or of Sellers or any of
their Affiliates with respect to the Business) prior to the Closing or that
would materially impede or delay the final determination of the Post- Closing
Statement. Parent Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that (i) the purpose of
the determination of the Working Capital portion of the Closing Statement is
to adjust the Purchase Price so as to reflect the change in net Working
Capital resulting only from the operation of the Business and (ii)
such change can be measured properly only if the calculation is done using
the same Closing Statement Methodologies. If Purchaser notifies Parent Seller
of an objection to the Closing Statement prior to the Closing, Parent Seller
and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith and make such changes to the
Closing Statement as are mutually agreed upon to resolve the dispute. If
Parent Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the Closing Statement
following such good faith negotiations, the Closing Statement delivered by
Parent Seller shall be used for purposes of calculating the Estimated
Adjustment Amount.

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to Parent Seller a working capital statement (the "
_ _Post-Closing Statement__ "), setting forth the actual Adjustment
Amount, calculated as of the Post-Closing Measurement Time, and the
calculation of the Adjustment Amount, including the Closing Working Capital
and the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (in each case, calculated as of the
Post-Closing Measurement Time), together with a certification of a senior
officer of Purchaser that the Post-Closing Statement was prepared and
calculated in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement. Purchaser
shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and in a manner
that shall not materially interfere with the performance of their regular
duties, to appropriate personnel of Sellers to assist Purchaser in the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement. The Post-Closing Statement shall be
in the form of the Sample Closing Statement and prepared and calculated in
accordance with the Closing Statement Methodologies; _provided,_ _however_ ,
that assets newly acquired and liabilities newly incurred following the date
of the Sample Closing Statement that cannot be appropriately placed in line
items in the Sample Closing Statement, but that constitute Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities, will be included in the Closing Statement in accordance
with GAAP.

 

(d) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent Seller of the Post-
Closing Statement, Parent Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of
any dispute Parent

 



-23  Seller has with respect to the Post-Closing Statement (the " _ _Dispute
Notice__ "); _provided,_ _however_ , that if Parent Seller does not deliver
any Dispute Notice to Purchaser within such thirty (30)-day period, the Post-
Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The
Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for any dispute
included therein, the amounts involved and Parent Sellers determination of
the Adjustment Amount, including the Closing Working Capital; _provided,_
_however_ , that any dispute set forth in the Dispute Notice shall be limited
to the determination of the Adjustment Amount and Parent Seller may not
dispute the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used
in preparing the Post-Closing Statement unless they are inconsistent with the
Closing Statement Methodologies. Upon receipt by Purchaser of a Dispute
Notice, Purchaser and Parent Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any dispute set forth therein. If Purchaser and Parent Seller, such good faith
effort notwithstanding, fail to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30)
Business Days following receipt by Purchaser of the Dispute Notice (the " _
_Dispute Resolution Period__ "), then Purchaser and Parent Seller jointly
shall engage, within ten (10) Business Days following the expiration of the
Dispute Resolution Period, KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unavailable or
conflicted, another nationally recognized major accounting firm selected
jointly by Parent Seller and Purchaser (the " _ _Independent
Accounting Firm__ ") to resolve any such dispute. If Parent Seller and
Purchaser are unable to agree on the Independent Accounting Firm or if KPMG
LLP is unavailable or conflicted, then each of Parent Seller and Purchaser
shall select a nationally recognized major accounting firm, and the two (2)
firms will mutually select a third nationally recognized major accounting firm
to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm. If Parent Seller and Purchaser do
not timely appoint an Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this
Section 2.9(d), either Parent Seller or Purchaser may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly
as practicable, and in any event not more than fifteen (15) days following
the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Parent Seller
shall each prepare and submit a presentation detailing each partys complete
statement of proposed resolution of each issue still in dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm. Purchaser and Parent Seller shall cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to, as soon as practicable after the submission of
the presentations described in the immediately preceding sentence, and in any
event not more than thirty (30) days following such presentations, make a
final determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the
appropriate amount of each of the line items that remain in dispute as
indicated in the Dispute Notice. With respect to each disputed line item,
such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Parent
Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the
lower, of the amounts advocated by Parent Seller or Purchaser, as applicable,
in their respective presentations to the Independent Accounting Firm described
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of the disputes to be resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether any
determination of the Adjustment Amount was properly calculated in accordance
with the Closing Statement Methodologies, and the Independent Accounting Firm
is not to make any other determination. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
payable by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent Seller, on the other hand,
in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed items submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm and unsuccessfully disputed by each such
party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the
total amount of disputed items so submitted. All determinations made by the
Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing Statement, as modified by
the Independent Accounting Firm, will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto.

 



-24 (e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.9,
Parent Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with and make available to one
another and their respective Representatives all information, records, data
and working papers, in each case, to the extent related to the Purchased
Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Business, and shall permit access to its
facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Post-Closing Statement and the resolution of
any disputes thereunder.

 

(f) (i) If the Closing Purchase Price, solely for this purpose calculated by
applying the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.9(c) and Section 2.9(d)) in lieu of the Estimated Adjustment Amount, is less
than the Closing Purchase Price actually paid pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i),
then the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of
such shortfall, and Parent Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in
cash equal to such shortfall to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser
to Parent Seller. Any such payment is to be made within five (5) Business
Days of the date on which the Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.9.

 

(ii) If the Closing Purchase Price, solely for this purpose calculated by
applying the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.9(c) and Section 2.9(d)) in lieu of the Estimated Adjustment Amount, is
greater than the Closing Purchase Price actually paid pursuant to Section
2.8(a)(i), then the Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of
such excess, and Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash
equal to such excess to Parent Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent
Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to be made within five (5) Business
Days of the date on which the Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.9.

 

Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation._ Sellers and Purchaser agree to
allocate and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate,
the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9) and any
other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _ _Allocation
Principles__ ") and the procedures set forth in this Section 2.10. No later
than ninety (90) days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.9, Purchaser shall deliver to Parent Seller a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.9) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration
for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Principles (the " _ _Purchaser s Allocation__"). If Parent
Seller disagrees with the Purchasers Allocation, Parent Seller may, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Purchasers Allocation, deliver a notice
(the " _ _Seller Allocation Notice__ ") to Purchaser to such effect,
specifying those items as to which Parent Seller disagrees and setting forth
Parent Sellers proposed allocation. If the Seller Allocation Notice is duly
delivered, Parent Seller and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days
following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts to

 



-25  determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.9) and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date. If Parent Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. Any
allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.9) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
purposes determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the
Allocation Principles. The allocation, as prepared by Purchaser if the Seller
Allocation Notice has not been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement
between Parent Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm (the " _ _Allocation__ ") shall be conclusive and binding on
the parties hereto. None of Parent Seller, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent with the Allocation
on any Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or
foreign Law).

 

Section 2.11 _Proration of Certain Expenses._ (a) Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, all installments of special assessments or other charges
on or with respect to the Purchased Assets payable by each Seller for any
period beginning prior to and ending on or after the Closing Date, including,
without limitation, rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all municipal,
utility or authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas charges,
garbage or waste removal and cost of fuel, shall be prorated so that such
Seller shall be responsible for payment of the portion of any such installment
applicable to the portion of such period occurring prior to the Closing Date
and Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of the portion of any such
installment applicable to the portion of such period occurring on or after the
Closing Date. Each party shall pay its proportionate share promptly upon the
receipt of any bill, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If such
charges or rates are assessed either based upon time or for a specified
period, such charges or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01 a.m., New York
City time on the Closing Date. If such charges or rates are assessed based
upon usage of utility or similar services, such charges shall be prorated
based upon meter readings taken on the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, this Section 2.11 shall not apply with respect to Property Taxes,
the proration of which shall be governed by Section 6.3.

 

(b) All refunds, reimbursements, installments of license fees or other use
related revenue receivable by any party to the extent attributable to the
operation of the Business for any period beginning prior to and ending on or
after the Closing Date shall be prorated so that each Seller shall be entitled
to the portion of any such installment applicable to the portion of such
period occurring prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be entitled to
the portion of any such installment applicable to the portion of such period
occurring on or after the Closing Date. If Purchaser or a Seller, as the case
may be, shall receive any such payments after the Closing Date, such party
shall promptly remit to such other party its share of such payments.

(c) The prorations pursuant to this Section 2.11 to the extent known and
calculable at the time of the Closing shall be calculated as of the Closing
Date and the prorations pursuant to this Section 2.11 to extent not known and
calculable at the time of the Closing may be calculated after the Closing
Date, as each item to be prorated (including any such obligation, assessment,
charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee or revenue) accrues or
comes 

 



-26  due, _provided_ that, in any event, any such proration shall be calculated
not later than thirty (30) days after the party requesting proration of any
item obtains the information required to calculate such proration of such
item.

Section 2.12 _Non-Assignment_. (a) This Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign or transfer any of the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof or change of
control of the Business (i) is prohibited by Law, or (ii) without the
approval, authorization or consent of, filing with, notification to, or
granting or issuance of any license, order, waiver or Permit by, any third
party or Governmental Entity (collectively, " _ _Approvals__ "), would (A)
constitute a breach thereof, (B) be reasonably likely to subject a Seller,
Purchaser, or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or
Affiliates, to civil or criminal liability, (C) be reasonably likely to make
such assignment or transfer or change of control void or voidable or (D) in
any way adversely affect the rights thereunder of a Seller, Purchaser, or any
of their respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, and such
Approval is not obtained at or before the Closing.

(b) If the Closing occurs and either of the circumstances described in clauses
(i) or (ii) of Section 2.12(a) exists, then each Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) with respect to the Approvals set forth in
Section 2.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (" _
_Specified Approvals__ ") only, meet with the parties set forth in Section
2.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and attempt to obtain such
Specified Approvals (in a form which is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser),
(ii) provide Purchaser with all of the benefits and burdens of the applicable
Purchased Asset or portion of the applicable Purchased Asset, (iii) cooperate
in any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits and
burdens to Purchaser, including accepting direction as Purchaser shall
reasonably request of Parent Seller and its Affiliates, (iv) keep Purchaser
reasonably and fully informed in a timely manner as to all developments
regarding the Approvals and Purchased Assets, including by providing
Purchaser with copies of all material correspondence, drafts and other
material communications regarding same and (v) enforce, at the request of
Purchaser, any rights of such Seller arising from any such Purchased
Asset. With respect to Purchased Assets that cannot be assigned and with
respect to which a Seller cannot obtain Approvals, subject to Section 9.10,
Purchaser shall, as agent or subcontractor for such Seller, pay, perform and
discharge fully the liabilities and obligations of such Seller effective as
of the Closing, to the extent constituting Assumed Liabilities. With respect
to Transferred Contracts that can only be partially assigned to Purchaser or
for which any Seller is providing the benefits and burdens to Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 2.12, Sellers shall not amend or modify such
Transferred Contract in any manner that has any effect on Purchaser with
respect to the portion of such Transferred Contract that has been or will be
assigned to Purchaser without Purchasers prior written consent. This Section
2.12(b) shall not apply to the treatment of any Designated Leases, which shall
be subject to Section 5.22.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.12 to the contrary,
none of Sysco, any Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be required to expend money, commence any litigation or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to fulfill its
obligation under this Section 2.12 or Section 5.22, other than the reasonable
fees of and payments to such Sellers legal and professional advisors. Each
Sellers obligations under this Section 2.12 shall, with respect to each
Transferred Contract, survive for the current term of such
Transferred Contract without giving effect to any extensions or renewals
thereof by Purchaser after the Closing Date.

 



-27 (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.12(b), the parties acknowledge and agree that in
connection with obtaining the Approvals Purchaser shall not be required to
(i) divest any of its respective businesses or assets, including any part of
the Purchased Assets acquired pursuant to the terms and conditions of
Agreement, take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation
that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results
of operations or prospects of Purchaser or its Affiliates or (ii) pay any
funds or accept any material modification to the Purchased Asset.

Section 2.13 _Title Insurance_. Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate in good
faith and use reasonable efforts to cause the Title Company at Closing to
issue to Purchaser (or its designee) an American Land Title Association (or
State equivalent, as applicable) owners title insurance policy (or so-called
marked title binder) for each of the Owned Real Properties (each, an " _
_Owner s Title Policy__") in the form of the applicable Pro Forma Policy of
Title Insurance attached as _Exhibit I_ (collectively the " _ _Pro Forma
Policies__ "), which shall provide that fee title to such Owned Real Property
is vested in Purchaser (or its designee) subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances. Purchaser shall be entitled to request that the Title Company
provide such endorsements (including, without limitation, extended coverage)
to each Owners Title Policy, as Purchaser may reasonably require; _provided_
that (a) such endorsements shall be at no cost, and shall impose no
additional liability on, any of Sellers, (b) Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement shall not be conditioned upon Purchasers ability to obtain
such endorsements or extended coverage and (c) the Closing Date shall not be
delayed as a result of Purchasers request. Sellers shall, at or prior to the
Closing, Remove all Required Removal Exceptions.

respective obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by each Seller with

to a right of termination, loss of rights, adverse modification of provisions,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, or result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the Purchased
Assets under any provision of (a) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of such Seller or (b) any Judgment or Law applicable to the Business, except,
in the case of this clause (b), for any such items that would not reasonably

results of operations of the Business as of the respective dates thereof and
for the respective time periods covered, in each case, in accordance with
GAAP (except as set forth in Section 3.6(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules) consistently applied during the period covered thereby.

 

(b) The system of internal controls over financial reporting with respect to
the Business is sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable
assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the Business Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP,
except as disclosed in Section 3.6(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, and
to maintain accountability for the assets of the Business, (ii) that receipts
and expenditures are executed only in accordance with managements

Purchasers consent were not obtained. Since September 1, 2014, (i) no assets

another business of Sellers or their Affiliates that is not included within

for use by each Seller in the Business and constitute all material assets
that are necessary for the conduct of the Business in all material respects as

operation of the Business as previously conducted and as currently conducted

or both, would constitute such a default under any such restrictive covenants,
in each case except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

 



-31 (d) As of the date hereof, (i) all buildings, structures, fixtures, building

") are in good condition and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, in all
material respects and sufficient for the operation of the Business as

Property that would have a Business Material Adverse Effect, whether or not

performance of any material work or alteration with respect to the Real
Property or any portion thereof. No Seller has received written notice from
any insurance company concerning, and no Seller is aware of, any defects or
inadequacies in the Real Property, which, if not corrected, would result in
the termination of insurance coverage or increase its cost.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

Except as set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in the Purchaser

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and has all necessary

 



-41  organizational power and authority to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except as would not reasonably be expected to impair or materially

all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by
Purchaser of this Agreement, the performance of Purchasers obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Purchaser of the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other action of Purchaser. Purchaser has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Sysco and each Seller, this Agreement constitutes Purchasers

its terms, subject to the effect of any Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a Proceeding in equity or at law).

 

Section 4.3 _No Conflicts; Consents._ The execution and delivery by Purchaser
of this Agreement does not, and the performance by Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by Purchaser with the terms

(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, loss of rights, modification of provisions, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation under, or increase in any payments or
obligations pursuant to or result in the creation of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries under, any provision of (a) the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or equivalent governing documents of Purchaser or (b) any Judgment or
Law applicable to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, or the properties or assets

financing committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter is collectively referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_." Purchaser has delivered to Parent

pricing caps and certain other terms (none of which would adversely affect the
amount or availability of the Financing) set forth therein have been
redacted). As of the date hereof, there are no agreements, side letters or
arrangements, other than the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, to which
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to either of the
Commitment Letter or the Financing that could adversely affect the
availability of the Financing.

conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the
total amount of the Financing. As of the date hereof and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, Purchaser
does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Letter
on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Purchaser have Knowledge that any
of the Lenders will not or intends not to perform its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, shall
provide Purchaser with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient, when
taken together with available cash on hand, for the satisfaction of all of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letter,

of or payable by Purchaser.

(d) The Commitment Letter is valid, binding and in full force and effect with
respect to Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties
thereto, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Purchaser under
the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter. Purchaser has paid in full
any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement. The
Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended or altered as of the date
hereof and none of the respective commitments under any of the Commitment
Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect prior to the
date hereof.

(e) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Purchaser or any
Affiliate or any other financing be a condition to any of Purchasers
obligations hereunder.

 

Section 4.5 _Proceedings._ As of the date hereof, other than the FTCs
investigation of the Mergers, there are no Proceedings or claims pending,
filed or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transaction and the

be fully satisfied by Purchaser.

financial and business matters as is reasonably necessary to evaluate, and is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser confirms that Parent

Business and Purchaser confirms that it has made an independent investigation,
analysis and evaluation of the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and
the Business.

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters._

 

(a) _Treatment of Business Employees._ No later than thirty (30) days prior to
the end of the Employee Lease Term, Purchaser shall offer employment
commencing as of the day following the last date of the Employee Lease Term
(or such later date as contemplated by Section 5.6(g)) (in each case, the " _
_Employee Transfer Date__ ") to each Business Employee who remains a Business
Employee through the end of the Employee Lease Term on terms and conditions
consistent with this Section 5.6(a). Any such employee who commences
employment with Purchaser shall be referred to herein as a " _ _Transferred
Business Employee__."

 



-51 Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Business Employee who is receiving short-
or long-term disability benefits or on a leave of absence required by
applicable Law shall be offered employment subject to and in accordance with
Section 5.6(g) and shall not become a Transferred Business Employee unless and
until the date such employee commences employment with Purchaser. With
respect to each Transferred Business Employee who is not covered by a
collective bargaining Contract or other labor Contract, Purchaser shall
maintain, for a period of at least twelve (12) months immediately following
the Employee Transfer Date, (i) a wage rate or cash salary level that is no
lower than that in effect for such employee immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) incentive compensation (excluding equity) and employee benefits that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided by Purchaser to
its similarly situated employees. The foregoing notwithstanding, Purchaser
shall not be prohibited by this Section 5.6(a) from terminating the employment
of any Transferred Business Employee following the Employee Transfer Date,
subject, however, to Purchasers obligations under this Section 5.6. As of and
after the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall provide to each Transferred
Business Employee full credit for all purposes under any Seller Benefit Plans
and each other employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement, in each case
maintained for the benefit of Transferred Business Employees as of and after
the Employee Transfer Date by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, for such
Transferred Business Employees service prior to the Employee Transfer Date
with Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates, to the same extent such service
is recognized by Parent Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Employee Transfer Date; _provided,_ _however_ , that Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not be required to recognize such service (x) for purposes of
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, (y) for purposes
of plans that are frozen to new participants, or (z) to the extent that such
credit would result in duplication of benefits.

(b)  _Health Coverages._ Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) waive any limitation on health insurance coverage of Transferred
Business Employees and their eligible dependents due to pre-existing
conditions under all applicable medical plans of Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser to the extent that such condition was satisfied or waived under the
comparable Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Employee Transfer Date and (ii)
credit all Transferred Business Employees and their eligible dependents with
all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums and deductible payments
and co-payments paid by such person, in each case, under the comparable Seller
Benefit Plan prior to the Employee Transfer Date during the plan year in
which the Employee Transfer Date occurs for the purpose of determining the
extent to which any such person has satisfied his or her deductible and
whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any
health insurance plans of Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser for such
year.

(c) _Flexible Spending Accounts._ Sellers and Purchaser shall take all
actions necessary or appropriate so that, effective as of the Employee
Transfer Date, (i) the account balances (whether positive or negative) (the "
_ _Transferred Account Balances__ ") under Sellers flexible spending account
plans (collectively, the " _ _Seller Flex Plan__ ") of the Transferred
Business Employees who are participants in the Seller Flex Plan (the " _
_Covered Employees__ ") shall be transferred to one or more comparable plans
of Purchaser (collectively, the " _ _Purchaser Flex Plan__ "), (ii) the
elections, contribution levels and coverage levels of the Covered Employees
shall apply under the Purchaser Flex Plan in the same manner as under the
Seller Flex Plan, and (iii) the Covered Employees shall be reimbursed from the
Purchaser Flex Plan for claims

 



-52  incurred at any time during the plan year of the Seller Flex Plan in which
the Employee Transfer Date occurs from and after the Closing Date on the same
basis and the same terms and conditions as under the Seller Flex Plan. As
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the amount of the Transferred Account Balances is
determined, Parent Seller shall pay Purchaser the net aggregate amount of the
Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is positive, and Purchaser shall
pay Parent Seller the net aggregate amount of the Transferred Account
Balances, if such amount is negative.

 

(d) _Severance_. Notwithstanding anything in subsection (a) above, with
respect to any Transferred Business Employee whose employment is terminated
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on or prior to December 31, 2015, under
any circumstances that would give rise to a right to severance payments and
benefits under the US Foods, Inc. Severance Plan, restated effective as of
July 31, 2013 (the " _ _Severance Plan__ "), subject to such Transferred
Business Employees execution of a release of claims in a form customarily
provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees, Purchaser shall
provide each such Transferred Business Employee with the greater of (x) the
severance payments and benefits that such Transferred Business Employee would
have received under the Severance Plan and (y) the severance payments and
benefits due to a similarly situated employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
as applicable, pursuant to Purchasers severance plan that is in effect on the
date of such termination (and for the avoidance of doubt in each case, such
Transferred Business Employee shall be credited for all service with Sellers,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates as provided in Section 5.6(a));
_provided,_ _however_ , if any such Transferred Business Employee is entitled
to severance benefits under an individual severance, employment or similar
agreement, or a collective bargaining Contract or other labor Contract, the
terms of such agreement and not this Section 5.6(d) shall govern.

 

(e) _WARN Act and Corresponding State Laws._ (i) On or before the Employee
Transfer Date, for any site of employment at which Business Employees are
located, Parent Seller shall provide a list of the name and site of employment
of any and all employees of Parent Seller and its Affiliates who have
experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff as defined
by the WARN Act (or any similar applicable state or local law requiring
notice to employees in the event of a closing or layoff) within ninety (90)
days prior to the Employee Transfer Date. Parent Seller shall update this list
up to and including the Employee Transfer Date.

(ii) For a period of ninety (90) days after the Employee Transfer Date,
Purchaser shall not engage in any conduct that would result in an employment
loss or layoff for a sufficient number of Transferred Business Employees
which, if aggregated with any such conduct on the part of Parent Seller or its
Affiliates prior to the Employee Transfer Date, would trigger the WARN Act or
any similar applicable state or local law.

(f) _Vacation and Other Paid Time Off_. Upon the Employee Transfer Date (or a
TSA Employees TSA Employee Transition Date, if later), Purchaser shall
recognize and credit each Transferred Business Employee for his or her unused
vacation time and other paid time off accrued under the applicable policies
and programs of Parent Seller and its Affiliates; _provided_ that, if such
transfer is not permitted by applicable Law without consent of the Transferred

 



-53  Business Employee, Parent Seller and its Affiliates shall seek such consent
and (i) with respect to those Transferred Business Employees who provide such
consent, Purchaser shall recognize and credit such unused vacation time and
other paid time off upon the Employee Transfer Date (or a TSA Employees TSA
Employee Transition Date, if later) and (ii) with respect to those Transferred
Business Employees who do not provide such consent, Parent Seller shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, upon the Employee Transfer Date (or a TSA
Employees TSA Employee Transition Date, if later) pay such Transferred
Business Employee, in accordance with the applicable policies and programs of
Parent Seller and its Affiliates and applicable Law, for such unused vacation
time and other paid time off. Parent Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any
Liabilities related to vacation or other paid time off accrued through
the Closing Date that are assumed and paid by Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 5.6(f) that are not reflected on the Post-Closing Statement, and
Purchaser shall reimburse Parent Seller for any Liabilities related to
vacation or other paid time off that are paid by Parent Seller or its
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.6(f) that are reflected on the Post-
Closing Statement. As to each Transferred Business Employee, Purchaser shall
credit periods of service prior to the Employee Transfer Date (or a TSA
Employees TSA Employee Transition Date, if later) for purposes of determining
accrual under Purchasers vacation and other paid time-off policies.

 

(g) _Disability Benefits._ Parent Seller shall be responsible for continuing
any salary continuation benefits for any Business Employee on short-term
leave immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date, provided that such
benefits in respect of the period following the Closing Date will be provided
by Parent Seller and reimbursed by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of
the Employee Lease Agreement. Parent Seller shall be responsible for
providing short- and long-term disability benefits to any Business Employee
who was on short- or long-term disability leave immediately prior to the
Employee Transfer Date. If any Business Employee not covered by an Assumed
CBC who is receiving short- or long-term disability benefits or on a leave of
absence required by applicable Law as of the Employee Transfer Date is, within
six (6) months following the Employee Transfer Date (or such longer period
required by applicable Law), able to return to work, Purchaser shall offer
employment to such Business Employee, and any such offer shall be on terms
consistent with those applicable to Transferred Business Employees generally
under this Section 5.6. With respect to any Business Employee covered by an
Assumed CBC who is receiving short- or long-term disability benefits as of the
Employee Transfer Date or on a leave of absence required by applicable Law,
the terms of such Business Employees return to work shall be governed by the
applicable Assumed CBC and applicable Law.

 

(h) _401(k) Plan._ Effective at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, Purchaser shall establish, and Parent Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser to establish, participation by the Transferred
Business Employees in Purchasers tax-qualified defined contribution plan or
plans with a cash or deferred feature (the " _ _Purchaser 401(k) Plan__ ")
for the benefit of each Transferred Business Employee who, as of immediately
prior to the Employee Transfer Date, was eligible to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent Seller or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _ _Seller 401(k) Plans__ "). As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Employee Transfer Date, and upon receipt by
Parent Seller of a current favorable determination letter issued by
the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan and
related trust, Parent Seller shall cause the trustees of the Seller 401(k)
Plans to transfer from each trust that forms a part of the Seller 401(k) Plans
to each trust

 



-54  that forms a part of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan the account balances of the
Transferred Business Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plans, determined as of
the date of the transfer. Such transfers shall be made in kind, including
promissory notes evidencing the transfer of outstanding loans. Any asset and
Liability transfers pursuant to this Section 5.6(h) shall comply in all
respects with Sections 411(d)(6) and 414(l) of the Code. The transfer of any
Transferred Business Employees employment to Purchaser or its Affiliates
shall not result in loss of that Transferred Business Employees unvested
benefits under the Seller 401(k) Plans or the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, and
no Transferred Business Employee shall be entitled to a distribution of his
or her benefit under the Seller 401(k) Plans as a result of such transfer of
employment.

 

(i) _Collective Bargaining Contracts._ (i) From and after the Employee
Transfer Date, Purchaser shall assume and honor the collective bargaining
Contracts set forth in Section 3.18(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the
" _ _Assumed CBCs__ "). Purchaser agrees as a condition of the Transaction
that it shall fully assume all terms and obligations of the Assumed CBCs
immediately effective upon the Employee Transfer Date and that it shall fully
abide by the terms of the Assumed CBCs during the remaining term of such
Contracts. Parent Seller, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate in connection with any engagement in any type of bargaining required
under applicable Law (including "effects" bargaining) with any collective
bargaining representative between the date of this Agreement and the Employee
Transfer Date, subject to applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt,
references in the Assumed CBCs to participation in Seller Benefit Plans shall
be replaced by references to participation in corresponding benefit plans of
Purchaser and its Affiliates.

(ii) With respect to each Multiemployer Plan to which Parent Seller or its
applicable Affiliate is required to contribute under an Assumed CBC as of
immediately prior to the Closing, for so long as Purchaser is obligated to
contribute pursuant to the applicable Assumed CBC, Purchaser shall be
obligated to contribute to such Multiemployer Plan under the applicable
Assumed CBC substantially the same number of contribution base units for which
Parent Seller or its applicable Affiliate had an obligation to contribute.
Prior to the start of the first plan year of the applicable Multiemployer
Plan beginning after the Closing Date, Parent Seller and Purchaser jointly
shall seek a variance from the requirements of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) and (C)
of ERISA. Subject to the next sentence, and if such variance or exemption is
not obtained, Purchaser shall provide to each such Multiemployer Plan for a
period of five (5) plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning
after the Closing Date (or, if earlier, until the date Purchaser obtains a
variance or exemption from the applicable Multiemployer Plan or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation), a bond issued by a corporate surety company
that is an acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an
amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution,
satisfactory to such Multiemployer Plan, which bond or escrow shall be paid to
such Multiemployer Plan if Purchaser withdraws from such Multiemployer Plan,
or fails to make a contribution when due, at any time during the first five
(5) plan years beginning after the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the
greater of:

(x) the average annual contribution required to be made by Parent Seller or
its applicable Affiliate to such Multiemployer Plan with respect to the
operations under the applicable Assumed CBC for the three (3) plan years prior
to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, and

(y) the annual contribution that Parent Seller or its applicable Affiliate was
required to make to the Multiemployer Plan with respect to the operations
under the applicable Assumed CBC for the last plan year prior to the plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs.

 



-55 If Purchaser withdraws from the applicable Multiemployer Plan in a complete
withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations covered by the
applicable Assumed CBC, during the first five (5) plan years beginning after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be primarily liable to such Multiemployer
Plan for any resulting withdrawal liability and, to the extent required under
Section 4204(a)(2) of ERISA, provided that Parent Seller shall be secondarily
liable to such Multiemployer Plan for any withdrawal liability Parent Seller
would have had to such Multiemployer Plan with respect to the operations
covered by the applicable Assumed CBC (but for Section 4204 of ERISA) if the
liability of Purchaser with respect to such Multiemployer Plan is not paid. If
Purchaser intends or expects to default on its covenant to pay any assessment
of withdrawal liability when due, Purchaser agrees to notify Parent Seller of
such intention, and shall allow Parent Seller to pay the liability that has
been assessed.

 

(j) _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

 

(k) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit
plan or (ii) prohibit Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan or from terminating the employment of
any Transferred Business Employee. The provisions of this Section 5.6 are
solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing
in this Section 5.6, express or implied, shall confer upon any Business
Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other Person, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement or a right of any employee or beneficiary of
such employee or other Person under an employee benefit plan that such
employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the
terms of that employee benefit plan without regard to this Agreement.

 

(l) _Restrictive Covenants._ Parent Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, and Sysco, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall or shall
cause their then-current Affiliates, in each case, as of and effective upon
the Closing to (i) assign to Purchaser and its Affiliates, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the applicable agreement, any and
all nondisclosure agreements or covenants, noncompetition agreements or
covenants, non-solicitation agreements or covenants or other restrictive
covenants (the " _ _Restrictive Covenants__ ") between Parent Seller or
its Affiliates or Sysco or its Affiliates, as applicable, on the one hand,
and any Transferred Business Employee, on the other hand; (ii) waive such
Restrictive Covenants, and any related claims against Purchaser and its
Affiliates and the Transferred Business Employees, with respect to the
Transferred Business Employees employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates and
activities for or on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates following the
Closing; and (iii) waive any Restrictive Covenants between Parent Seller or
its Affiliates or Sysco or its Affiliates, as applicable, on the one hand, and
any person who is a former employee of Parent Seller or its Affiliates or
Sysco or its Affiliates, as applicable, who performed services for the
Business between December 8, 2013 and the date of this Agreement and any
related claims against

 



-56  Purchaser and its Affiliates and such person with respect to such persons
employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates or activities for or on behalf of
Purchaser or its Affiliates following the Closing (but not, for the avoidance
of doubt, any claims that may exist against Purchaser and its Affiliates that
arise prior to the Closing Date).

 

(m) _Communications to Business Employees._ Prior to making any written or
oral mass communications to all Business Employees or a significant portion
thereof, in each case related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and pertaining to employment, compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
Seller shall provide a copy of the intended communication to Purchaser and
Purchaser shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication. Purchaser shall not make any such communications to Business
Employees prior to the Closing, except by requesting that Parent Seller make
such communication on Purchasers behalf, which Parent Seller shall consider
in good faith.

 

(n) _Non-Solicitation of Employees Providing Transition Services._ Purchaser
agrees that, in the interest of preserving the continuity and viability of
the Transition Services Agreement, neither it nor its Affiliates will, without
the prior written consent of Sysco or Parent Seller or except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, directly
or indirectly engage, recruit, solicit to employ or hire, offer employment to
or hire (whether as an officer, employee or consultant or other independent
contractor), (i) during the term of the Transition Services Agreement, any
employee of Sysco or Parent Seller, or their respective Affiliates, who is
providing services under the Transition Services Agreement, not including any
such employee who is employed in the shared services or IT functions in
Rosemont or Tempe, (ii) for the period that shared services are being
provided under the Transition Services Agreement, any employee of Sysco or
Parent Seller, or their respective Affiliates, who is employed in the shared
services function in Rosemont or Tempe, whether or not such employee is
providing services under the Transition Services Agreement, (iii) for the
period that IT services are being provided under the Transition Services
Agreement, any employee of Sysco or Parent Seller, or their respective
Affiliates, who is employed in the IT function in Rosemont or Tempe, whether
or not such employee is providing services under the Transition Services
Agreement, or (iv) for a period of one (1) year following the Closing, any
employee of Sysco or Parent Seller, or their respective Affiliates, (A) who
is employed in corporate national sales, or (B) whose personnel information is
presented to Purchaser pursuant to the process set forth on _Exhibit F_ or who
is introduced to Purchaser but who is not hired by Purchaser in accordance
with such process; _provided,_ _however_ , that the restrictions of this
Section 5.6(n) shall not apply to any general advertisement, or any search
firm engagement which, in any such case, is not directed or focused on any
such employee of Sysco or Parent Seller or their respective Affiliates during
the applicable restricted period (provided Purchaser shall not during the
applicable restricted period hire any such individuals who respond to such
general advertisement).

(o) _Selection of Certain Transferred Employees._ As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date set forth on Section 5.6(o) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, Purchaser, Parent Seller and Sysco shall
cooperate to facilitate, in accordance with a mutually agreed upon process set
forth as _Exhibit F_  (a) the selection and hiring of certain employees of
Parent Seller or Sysco for positions identified as Critical Interview Roles on
_Exhibit G_ on or

 



-57  prior to the Closing Date, for employment with Purchaser commencing on the
Employee Transfer Date, and (b) the selection and hiring of certain employees
of Parent Seller or Sysco for other positions identified in _Exhibit G_ , in
accordance with a schedule to be mutually agreed upon, for employment with
Purchaser commencing on or after the Employee Transfer Date (each such
employee, a " _ _TSA Employee__ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the
completion of the selection and hiring process for each specified position
shall not be deemed a condition to the obligations of any party hereto to
effect the Closing, and Purchaser, Parent Seller and Sysco undertake to use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to complete the selection and
hiring process for any such vacant positions as soon as practicable following
the Closing. Each TSA Employee who commences employment with Purchaser shall
become and shall be treated as a Transferred Business Employee hereunder as of
such employees TSA Employee Transition Date. Each TSA Employee who accepts
Purchasers employment offer during the Leasing Period (as defined in the
Employee Lease Agreement) shall be dedicated to providing services to
Purchaser and treated as a Leased Employee under the Employee Lease Agreement
for the remainder of the Leasing Period.

 

Section 5.7 _Financial Obligations._ At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall at its sole expense (a) arrange for substitute letters of credit,
surety bonds, Purchaser guarantees and other contractual obligations to
replace the outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and other
contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of Parent Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with or Relating to the Business (together,
the " _ _Guarantees__ "), such Guarantees being listed in Section 5.7 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules or (b) assume all obligations under each
Guarantee, obtaining from the creditor or other counterparty (including, if
applicable, the issuing bank in respect of any letter of credit) a full and
irrevocable release of Parent Seller and its Affiliates that are liable,
directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of
other Liabilities to a counterparty in connection with the Guarantees.
Purchaser further agrees that to the extent that Parent Seller or any of its
Affiliates incur any cost or expense, or are required to make any payment
under any such Guarantees on or after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless Parent Seller and its Affiliates against, and reimburse
Parent Seller and its Affiliates for, any and all amounts paid under such
Guarantees, and shall promptly and in no event later than three (3) Business
Days after written demand therefor from Parent Seller, reimburse Parent Seller
and any of its Affiliates to the extent that any Guarantee is called upon
and Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates make any payment or incur any
Liability in respect of any such Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, (a)
Purchaser shall not be liable for any of Parent Sellers and its Affiliates
expenses in maintaining the Guarantees, whether or not such Guarantee is
drawn upon or required to be performed, and (b) nothing herein shall require
the Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates to maintain in effect any Guaranty
from or after the Closing. 

Section 5.8 _Names Following Closing_. (a) Except as expressly set forth
herein or in the Transition Services Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall use, or have the right to use, "USF Holding Corp.," "US
Foods, Inc.," "USF," "US Foods," "US Foodservice" or "Sysco" names or
any variations or derivatives thereof, or any Trademarks of Seller or any of
its Affiliates that are not included in the Purchased Assets (the " _ _Names__
") or any name that is confusingly similar to the Names. Purchaser further
acknowledges that it has no rights, and is not acquiring any rights, to use
the Names, except as expressly provided in this Section 5.8 or in the
Transition Services Agreement.

 



-58 (b) Purchaser shall, for a period of six (6) months following the Closing
Date, have the right to use any existing signs (including signs on trucks and
trailers), letterheads and other non-product specific documents and materials
included in the Purchased Assets (" _ _Existing Stock__ ") containing the
Names;  _provided_ that Sellers acknowledge and agree with respect to the use
of the Names on any signs for which a change requires third-party consent,
Purchaser shall not be in breach of this Section 5.8 if it has submitted a
request for such consent within three (3) months following the Closing Date
and is using good faith efforts to actively pursue such consent. For the
avoidance of doubt, at the end of the six (6)-month period following the
Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cease the use of any such
Existing Stock except for any such use that may continue pending receipt of
the applicable consent requested in accordance with this Section 5.8(b).

 

Section 5.9 _Proprietary IP License_. (a) From and after the Closing, Sellers
hereby grant, on behalf of themselves and their applicable Affiliates, to
Purchaser and its Affiliates (whether now existing or hereafter acquired), a
non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up right and
license to use, reproduce, display, perform, distribute and modify the trade
secrets and confidential Know-How used in the Business or a Distribution
Center as of the Closing Date and owned by a Seller (the " _ _Business
Intellectual Property__ "). The rights granted pursuant to this Section
5.9(a) are collectively referred to herein as the " _ _Business Intellectual
Property License__."

 

(b) The Business Intellectual Property License shall be binding on assignees
and transferees of the Business Intellectual Property.

 

(c) The Business Intellectual Property License shall be transferable, in whole
or in part, by Purchaser or its Affiliates, as applicable (and its or their
permitted assignees) to any third party that acquires one or more of the
Distribution Centers.

Section 5.10  _Insurance_. (a) Subject to Section 5.10(b), from and after the
Closing Date, the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and
the operations and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, shall cease to
be insured by Parent Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies or by any
of their self-insured programs, and neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Business) shall have any access,
right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies (including to
all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover the
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the operations or
assets or Liabilities in respect thereof except for such rights and claims
that constitute Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 2.4(p). Sellers or their
Affiliates may amend any insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate
to give effect to this Section 5.10(a). From and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall be responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for
the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the operations
and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof. Subject to Section 5.10(b),
Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise
any rights or claims of, or in respect of, the Business, the Purchased Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities and the operations and assets and Liabilities
in respect thereof, under or in respect of any past or current insurance
policy under which any of the foregoing is a named insured except for such
rights and claims that constitute Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 2.4(p).

 



-59 (b) With respect to any open claims against the insurance policies of Parent
Seller or its Affiliates relating to losses or damages suffered by the
Business or the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing and any rights and
claims that constitute Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 2.4(p) that have
been incurred but not reported, Parent Seller shall (i) use its reasonable
best efforts to pursue such claims and shall reasonably cooperate with and
assist Purchaser and its Affiliates in doing the same and (ii) remit to
Purchaser any and all proceeds realized from such claims upon settlement of
such claims, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Sellers
in connection with the performance of its obligations pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i). Following the Closing, Parent Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates to not, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise eliminate insurance coverage under the insurance policies of Parent
Seller or its Affiliates with respect to act, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets that occurred
or existed prior to the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.10, Parent
Seller and its Affiliates will keep each of the workers compensation
insurance policies set forth in Section 5.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules (" _ _Workers  Compensation Policies__"), or suitable replacements
therefor, in full force and effect through the last day of the Employee Lease
Term. Notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 5.10(a), with respect to
claims relating to acts, omissions, events or circumstances relating to
Business Employees that occurred or existed prior to the last day of the
Employee Lease Term that are covered by Workers Compensation Policies (" _
_Pre-Transfer WC Claims__ "), Parent Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser to
report Pre-Transfer WC Claims directly to the provider of such Workers
Compensation Policies (the " _ _WC Insurer__ ") and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Purchasers efforts to obtain the benefit of
such insurance coverage. Following the last day of the Employee Lease Term,
Parent Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, release,
commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate insurance coverage under each of
the Workers Compensation Policies with respect to acts, omissions, events or
circumstances relating to Business Employees, or any other employees of Parent
Seller or its Affiliates who become "Leased Employees" under the Employee
Lease Agreement, that occurred or existed prior to the last day of the
Employee Lease Term.

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.10 shall limit or supersede Sellers
obligations under Section 4.4 of the Employee Lease Agreement.

Section 5.11 _Litigation Support_. From and after the Closing, if and for so
long as any party to this Agreement is prosecuting, contesting or defending
any Proceeding or action by a third party in connection with (a) the
Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction relating to, in connection with or arising from the Business,
the Purchased Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Retained
Liabilities, the other party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and its
and their officers and employees) to, cooperate with the requesting party and
its counsel in such prosecution, contest or defense, including making
available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such
prosecution, contest or defense;  _provided_ that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the cooperating partys operations; _provided,_
_further_ , that the requesting party shall reimburse the cooperating party
for reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
assisting the requesting party pursuant to this Section 5.11.

 



-60 Section 5.12 _Payments._ (a) Parent Seller shall, or shall cause its
applicable Affiliate to, (i) promptly pay or deliver to Purchaser (or its
designated Affiliates) any monies or checks Relating to the Business that have
been sent to Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing,
including any monies or checks sent to bank accounts and lockboxes under the
control of Sellers or their Affiliates, by customers, suppliers or other
contracting parties of the Business to the extent they are or are in respect
of a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability hereunder and (ii) promptly
reimburse Purchaser (or its designated Affiliates) for any amounts paid by
Purchaser (including the Business) to the extent such payments are or are in
respect of an Excluded Asset or Retained Liability.

 

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, (i) promptly
pay or deliver to Parent Seller (or its designated Affiliates) any monies or
checks that have been sent to Purchaser (including the Business) after the
Closing to the extent they are not due to the Business or are in respect of an
Excluded Asset or Retained Liability hereunder and arise from the operation,
ownership or conduct of the Business or the Purchased Assets prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) promptly reimburse Parent Seller (or its designated
Affiliates) for any amounts paid by Parent Seller to the extent such payments
are or are in respect of a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability hereunder.

Section 5.13 _Financing_. (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letter, (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
(the " _ _Definitive Agreements__ ") consistent with the terms and conditions
contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in
any related fee letter) and (iii) satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by
Purchaser, obtaining the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing)
in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements and complying with its
obligations thereunder. If all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
have been satisfied or waived (other than the consummation of the Transaction)
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
Parties party thereto to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date (except that in no event
shall Purchaser be required to pursue litigation of any sort against the
Financing Parties or the Financing Related Parties; it being understood
notwithstanding the foregoing that in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Financing) by Purchaser or any Affiliate or any other financing be
a condition to any of Purchasers obligations hereunder). Purchaser shall
comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter in a timely and
diligent manner. Purchaser shall comply with its obligations under the
Commitment Letter in a timely and diligent manner. Purchaser shall give Parent
Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Commitment
Letter of which Purchaser has become aware or any termination of the
Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent Seller permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy (w) adds new (or materially adversely modifies
any existing) conditions to the

 



-61  consummation of the Financing, (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing, (y) adversely affects the ability of Purchaser to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified,
relative to the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against such other
parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or in the
Definitive Agreements in any material respect, or (z) would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it
being understood that Purchaser shall inform Parent Seller and Sysco in
writing promptly regarding any such amendment, modification or waiver
permitted hereunder); _provided,_ that for the avoidance of doubt, no consent
from Parent Seller shall be required for (A) any amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification of the Commitment Letter the effect of which is
limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof (including in replacement of a Lender or other Financing Party), (B)
implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in the Fee Letter
as in effect as of the date hereof or (C) any amendment, or replacement of or
supplement or modification to, the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements
so long as such action would not be prohibited by the foregoing clauses (w)
through (z).

 

(b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the
reason therefor, Purchaser will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
available cash on hand and any then-available Financing pursuant to the then-
existing Commitment Letter, to consummate the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses) on terms no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Purchaser (in its
reasonable judgment) than those contained in the Commitment Letter that
alternative debt financing would replace from the same or other sources and
which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative
debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions in the then-existing
Commitment Letter and (ii) promptly notify Parent Seller of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter
(or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time
in question). Purchaser shall provide Parent Seller with prompt written notice
of (A) any material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letter
or the Definitive Agreements of which Purchaser becomes aware and (B) the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Party with respect to any breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements of any material provision thereof. Purchaser shall keep Parent
Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
compliance by Purchaser with this Section 5.13 shall not relieve Purchaser of
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Financing is available.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent Seller shall provide and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its officers, employees, consultants, agents, advisors and other
Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide such cooperation
as is reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the 

 



-62  arrangement of the Financing ( _provided,_ that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Parent Seller
or its Subsidiaries), including (i) making senior management and advisors of
Parent Seller and its Subsidiaries available to participate in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) assisting Purchaser with Purchasers preparation of pro
forma financial information and pro forma financial statements and other
materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and
similar documents used in connection with the Financing, and providing
customary authorization and representation letters (for the avoidance of
doubt, not including representation letters to auditors) in connection
therewith, (iii) executing and delivering certificates, management
representation letters (for the avoidance of doubt, not including
representation letters to auditors) and other documents, to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser, and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral, (iv) requesting and cooperating in obtaining
customary and appropriate Lien terminations and instruments of discharge, (v)
providing reasonable access for Purchaser to the books and records,
properties, officers, directors, agents and Representatives of Sellers but
solely as and to the extent that that they relate to the Business, (vi)
assisting with due diligence activities relating to the Business and financial
and other information related thereto during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice, (vii) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing
Parties as promptly as reasonably practicable with such financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Business as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser, (viii) taking all actions reasonably requested to (A) permit the
prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Business and the
assets, business, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto, including inventory appraisals and field audits,
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and (B) establish bank
and other accounts and other blocked account contracts and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing after the Closing and (ix)
providing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
documentation and other information about the Business required by applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations
including the USA Patriot Act to the extent requested in writing by Purchaser
at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of the Closing Date. The foregoing
notwithstanding, (A) neither Parent Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any persons who are directors of Parent Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Financing, (B) neither Parent Seller nor any of its
Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives shall have any
obligations under any document executed or delivered by any such Person
pursuant to any of the foregoing (other than the delivery of customary
authorization and representation letters) and (C) none of Parent Seller or
its Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense
that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Purchaser in connection with the
Financing. Nothing contained in this Section 5.13(c) or otherwise shall
require Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates to be an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Financing. Purchaser shall, promptly upon request
by Parent Seller, reimburse Parent Seller for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Parent Seller or its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent Seller and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives for and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any
action taken by them at the request of Purchaser pursuant to this Section
5.13(c) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than

 



-63  information provided by Parent Seller or its Affiliates), in each case,
other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Parent Seller, its Subsidiaries and/or
their respective Representatives. Parent Seller hereby consents to the use of
its logos (and those of its Subsidiaries) in connection with the Financing;
_provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended
to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Parent Seller or its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of Parent Seller or its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective logos and on such other customary terms and conditions as
Parent Seller shall reasonably impose.

Section 5.14 _Carve-Out Financial Statements; Environmental Review_. (a)
Parent Seller shall prepare and deliver, at Parent Sellers expense, to
Purchaser (i) as soon as practicable following the end of the fiscal year if
the Closing occurs more than 45 days after December 31, 2014, the unaudited
select balance sheet detail for the Distribution Centers on a combined basis
reflecting assets and liabilities and related income statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2014 and (ii) for each monthly period ended

such month (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the " _ _Unaudited Carve-Out
Financial Statements__ "). The Unaudited Carve-Out Financial Statements (i)

Agreement (including any Willful Breach), and upon payment of the Termination
Fee in accordance with this Section 8.2 and the reimbursement of Purchasers
expenses by Sysco and Parent Seller pursuant to Section 5.1, no party to this
Agreement nor Affiliates or Representatives thereof shall have any further
liability or obligation to the other parties relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transaction.

 

Section 8.3 _Notice of Termination._ In the event of termination by Parent
Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice of such
termination shall be given by the terminating party to the other party to this
Agreement.

from and against any and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of or resulting
from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in
Article III, without regard to any materiality, Business Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifying condition or limitation in such representation or
warranty (other than with respect to

 



-74  any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.6(a), or any
representation or warranty, or portion thereof, to the extent requiring a list
(but not, for the avoidance of doubt, a list of exceptions to or exclusions
from any representation or warranty)); (ii) any breach of any covenant or

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:

 

(i) Parent Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Purchaser Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for, any Covered Losses pursuant to (A) Section 9.2(a)(i) to
the extent that such Covered Losses are reflected, recorded or included in
Working Capital on the Post-Closing Statement (as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.9); (B) Section 9.2(a)(i) (except with respect to any Covered
Losses incurred or suffered in respect of a breach of any representation or
warranty of Sellers contained in Section 3.17), unless the claim (or series
of related claims arising from substantially the same underlying facts, events
or circumstances) to which such Covered Losses relate involves Covered Losses
in excess of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) (the " _ _De
Minimis Amount__ ") and if such claim for Covered Losses does not exceed the
De Minimis Amount, such claim for Covered Losses shall not be applied to or
considered for purposes of the Deductible or otherwise for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Covered
Losses under this Section 9.2(b)(i); (C) Section 9.2(a)(i) (except with
respect to any Covered Losses incurred or suffered in respect of a breach
of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in Section 3.17),
until the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Covered
Losses thereunder exceeds eight million five hundred thousand dollars
($8,500,000) (1% of the Base Purchase Price) (the " _ _Deductible__ "), after
which Parent Seller shall be obligated for all of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties Covered Losses thereunder in excess of the Deductible, subject always
to Section 9.2(b)(i)(A) and (D) Section 9.2(a)(i) in respect of a breach of
any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in Section 3.17, except
for Covered Losses that are Taxes in respect of a Pre-Closing Period; and

 

(ii) except with respect to any Covered Losses incurred or suffered with
respect to the breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained
in Section 3.17, the cumulative indemnification obligation of Parent Seller
under Section 9.2(a)(i) shall in no event exceed one hundred twenty seven
million five hundred thousand dollars ($127,500,000) (15% of the Base
Purchase Price) (the " _ _Cap__ "); and

(iii) no claim for indemnification in relation to any Retained Liabilities or
Excluded Assets may be made by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the
date that is six (6) years following the Closing Date; _provided,_ _however_ ,
that claims arising after such six (6)-year period that arise from
substantially the same underlying facts, events or circumstances as claims
that were previously subject to a claim for indemnification under Section
9.2(a)(iii) and Section 9.2(a)(iv) shall 

 



-75  not be subject to the foregoing restriction; _provided,_ _further_ , that,
in the case of any Covered Losses incurred or suffered with respect to any
Excluded Taxes, no claim for indemnification may be made by Purchaser or any

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) Subject to the provisions of
this Article IX, effective at and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent Seller and its Affiliates,
including Sysco and its Subsidiaries, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, members, partners, controlling Persons,
agents and other Representatives (collectively, the " _ _Seller Indemnified
Parties__ "), from and against any and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered
by any of Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out of
or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in Article IV, without regard to any materiality,
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifying condition or
limitation in such representation or warranty (other than with respect to any
representation or warranty, or portion thereof, to the extent requiring a list
(but not, for the avoidance of doubt, a list of exceptions to or exclusions
from any representation or warranty)); (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (iii) any Purchased Asset;
(iv) any Assumed Liability; and (v) obligations listed on Section 9.3(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:

 

(i) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Seller Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Seller Indemnified Party
for, any Covered Losses pursuant to any claim under Section 9.3(a)(i), (A)
unless the claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the
same underlying facts, events or circumstances) to which such Covered Losses
relate involves Covered Losses in excess of the De Minimis Amount and if such
claim for Covered Losses does not exceed the De Minimis Amount, such claim for
Covered Losses shall not be applied to or considered for the purposes of the
Deductible or otherwise for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of
Seller Indemnified Parties Covered Losses under this Section 9.3(b)(i); and
(B) until the aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Parties Covered
Losses under Section 9.3(a)(i) exceeds the Deductible, after which Purchaser
shall be obligated for all Seller Indemnified Parties Covered Losses under
Section 9.3(a)(i) in excess of the Deductible, subject always to Section
9.3(b)(i)(A);

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of Purchaser under Section
9.3(a)(i) shall in no event exceed the Cap; and

(iii) no claim for indemnification in relation to any Assumed Liabilities or
Purchased Assets may be made by Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates after
the date that is six (6) years following the Closing Date; _provided,_
_however_ , that claims arising after such six (6)-year period that arise from
substantially the same underlying facts, events or circumstances as claims
that were previously subject to a claim for indemnification under Section
9.3(a)(iii) and Section 9.3(a)(iv) shall not be subject to the foregoing
restriction.

 



-76 Section 9.4 _Procedures._ (a) A Person that may be entitled to be
indemnified under this Agreement (the " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") shall
promptly notify the party or parties liable for such indemnification (the " _
_Indemnifying Party__ ") in writing of any pending or threatened claim or
demand that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would reasonably
be expected to give rise to such right of indemnification (including a pending
or threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against
the Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _ _Third-Party Claim__ "),
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided,_ that the failure
to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed
that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in Section 9.1 for such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third-Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a), the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third- Party
Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided,_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
and control of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.4(b), the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless
participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense. Purchaser or Parent Seller, as the case may be, shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
including by furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses, as
appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third-Party Claim, it shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any
Judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claim, in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided,_ that such settlement
or Judgment does not involve any injunctive relief or finding or admission of
any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party
and requires only the payment of monetary damages which shall be Covered
Losses hereunder. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any
Judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent Seller shall have the
exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with
respect to any (i) income Tax Return of any Seller or any of its Affiliates,
(ii) non-income Tax Return of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (except to
the extent such Tax Proceeding is related to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed

 



-77  Liabilities or the Business and could reasonably be expected to result in a
material increase in the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates) or
(iii) Tax Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes
Parent Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 9.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Purchaser and Parent Seller
acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Parent Seller and Purchaser, respectively, for any Covered Losses
(including any Covered Losses from claims for breach of contract, warranty,
tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on
common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement by any party, or any failure by any party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents; _provided,_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall
relieve Sellers for fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement and Purchasers
remedies in connection therewith shall not be limited to this Article IX.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except in the case
of fraud, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission
they may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Article IX shall not affect any remedy any party may have
under this Agreement before the Closing or upon termination of this Agreement
or any equitable remedy available to any party. Nothing in this Article IX
shall limit or modify any rights, obligations, remedies and other provisions
set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Article IX shall limit any party from making a claim in any
Proceeding that asserts that a Liability is an Assumed Liability or a Retained
Liability or that any Liability is not an Assumed liability or not a Retained
Liability.

Section 9.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions._ With respect to
each indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Covered
Losses shall be (a) net of any Tax Benefits realized by the Indemnified Party
by reason of such Covered Loss in the tax year of such Covered Loss or the
next succeeding three (3) tax years and (b) net of any third- party insurance
or indemnity, contribution or similar proceeds that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification (it being agreed that if third-party insurance or
indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds in respect of such facts are
recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys
making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), less
the amount of all costs and expenses incurred in the process of seeking and
obtaining such recovery (including increased premiums), and the Indemnified
Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and indemnity, contribution
or similar provisions covering such Covered Loss to the same extent as it
would if such Covered Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon
making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to
the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have
against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party.

 



-78 Section 9.7 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including Article IX), no party hereto
shall be liable to the other party or its Affiliates, whether in contract,
tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at law or in
equity, for any special or punitive damages (including lost profits,
diminution of value, or damages calculated on multiples of earnings or other
metrics approaches), and "Covered Losses" shall not include any such amounts,
other than any such amounts paid or owing to an unaffiliated third party as a
result of a claim, settlement, award or judgment.

Section 9.8 _Mitigation._ Each of the parties agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Covered Losses upon and after
becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Covered Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder; _provided,_
that (a) for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of such mitigation shall
constitute Covered Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder and (b) in no event shall any Indemnified Party be
required to commence or undertake any litigation, arbitration or similar
proceeding against any third party.

Section 9.9  _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments._ Except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law (including a "determination"
(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law)), Parent Seller, Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under Section 2.9, Section 2.11,
Section 6.3 and this Article IX as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax
purposes.

 

Section 9.10 _Indemnification for Unassigned Contracts._ Effective as of and
after the Closing, Parent Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Covered Losses
incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, to the
extent arising out of or resulting from a claim, action or judgment brought
by an unaffiliated third party as a result of (a) the failure to assign, or
obtain consents to assign, any National Customer Contract as of the Closing
(the " _ _Unassigned Contracts__ ") or (b) any actions taken or not taken by
Sellers under the Unassigned Contracts, including Sellers administration of
the Unassigned Contract. For purposes of this Section 9.10, "Covered Losses"
shall not include damages based on lost profits or damages calculated on
multiples of earnings, revenues or other metrics approaches, in each case,
that arise out of or result from the termination of any of the Unassigned
Contracts. Claims for indemnification under this Section 9.10 shall be
subject to Section 9.4. Purchaser agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its Covered Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Covered Losses that are indemnifiable under this Section 9.10; _provided,_
that (i) for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of such mitigation shall
constitute Covered Losses for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification hereunder and (ii) in no event shall any Purchaser
Indemnified Party be required to expend money, grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) or commence or undertake any litigation, arbitration
or similar proceeding against any third party, and to the extent that a
Purchaser Indemnified Party takes any such action, any Covered Losses or other
expenses or damages resulting therefrom shall not be subject to any
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, claims
for indemnification under this Section 9.10 shall not be subject to the De
Minimis Amount, the Deductible or the Cap.

 



-79 ARTICLE X GENERAL

 

PROVISIONS

Section 10.1  _Guarantee by Sysco._ (a) Sysco (the " _ _Guarantor__ ") hereby
irrevocably, absolutely, fully and unconditionally guarantees to Purchaser and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties the prompt and complete performance by each
Seller of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to the extent
arising at or following the Closing, including each Sellers obligations to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties following the Closing, and the
Guarantor shall cause each Seller to fully perform and comply with all of
Sellers obligations to the extent arising following the Closing under the
Transaction Documents (the " _ _Limited Guaranty__ ").

 

(b) The Limited Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of
collection, and Sysco and each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
Limited Guaranty is full and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment
of such Sellers and/or its designees or assigns Liabilities (other than in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in
any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the continuing validity
and enforceability of the Limited Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby waives (i)
any right to require Purchaser, as a condition of payment or performance by
such Guarantor of any obligations of each Seller hereunder, to proceed
against such Seller or pursue any other remedy whatsoever in the event that
such Seller fails to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by Law limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties.

(c) The Guarantor represents and warrants to Purchaser that (i) it is a
Delaware corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite corporate power
and authority necessary to execute and deliver the Limited Guaranty, and to
perform its obligations hereunder, (ii) the execution, delivery and
performance by it of the Limited Guaranty have been approved by the requisite
corporate action and (iii) no other action on its part is necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the Limited
Guaranty.

(d) Without limiting in any way the foregoing Limited Guaranty, but subject
in all respects to any and all limitations on Sellers covenants, agreements
and other obligations hereunder, the Guarantor agrees to cause, and to take
all actions to enable, each Seller to adhere to each provision of this
Agreement which requires an act or omission on the part of each Seller or any
of its Affiliates to cause or enable each Seller to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(e) The provisions of Section 10.2, Section 10.3, Section 10.4, Section 10.6,
Section 10.7, Section 10.8, Section 10.9, Section 10.10, Section 10.11 and
Section 10.13 of this Agreement will be deemed to be applicable to this
Section 10.1. For purposes of clarity, the Limited Guaranty provided in this
Section 10.1 shall not be effective until the Closing.

Section 10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, along with Seller Disclosure Schedules and
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, constitute the entire

 



-80  agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter. Neither party shall be liable
or bound to the other party in any manner by any representations, warranties
or covenants relating to such subject matter except as specifically set forth
herein and therein.

 

Section 10.3 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and
obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by either party without
the prior written consent of the other party hereto; _provided,_ that
Purchaser may assign all or part of its rights under this Agreement to, and
(subject to the final proviso of this sentence) all or part of
its obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, any direct or
indirect Subsidiaries of Purchaser; _provided,_ _further_ , that following the
Closing, Purchaser may make a collateral assignment of all or part of its
rights under this Agreement to any financial institution in connection with
the Financing provided that no such assignment will limit Purchasers
obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section
10.3 shall be void. Subject to the two (2) preceding sentences, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.4 _Amendments and Waivers._ This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto. By an instrument in writing, Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers,
on the other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or
provision of this Agreement that the other party was or is obligated to comply
with or perform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or
supplement shall be made to this Agreement that would adversely affect the
rights of the Financing Parties or Financing Related Parties as set forth in
Section 10.3, Section 10.5, Section 10.8, Section 10.9, Section 10.14 and
this Section 10.4 without the consent of such Financing Parties or Financing
Related Parties.

 

Section 10.5 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ Except for (x) Section 9.2 and
Section 9.3, which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the
parties specified therein and (y) Section 10.3, Section 10.4, Section 10.8,
Section 10.9, Section 10.14 and this Section 10.5, which are intended to
benefit, and to be enforceable by, each Financing Party and Financing Related
Party, this Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto are not intended to confer in or on
behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and
assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies with respect to
the subject matter or any provision hereof.

 



-81 Section 10.6 _Notices._ All notices and other communications to be given to
any party hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if

Section 10.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur if the parties hereto do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction.

Section 10.8  _Governing Law and Jurisdiction._ (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the
personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for New Castle
County, or if (but only if) such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute, the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, or if (but only if) such United States
District Court also does not have jurisdiction over such dispute, any Delaware
State court sitting in New Castle County, if any dispute (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the Transaction or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transaction or the other
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery in and for New Castle County, or if (but only if) such Delaware Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Proceeding,
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or if (but only
in the event) such United States District Court also does not have
jurisdiction over such Proceeding, any Delaware State court sitting in New
Castle County. Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in
any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 10.6.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or

 



-83  third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Parties or
Financing Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The
parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of Section 10.9
relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third party- claim referenced in this Section 10.8(b).

 

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM
AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER
LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN
WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS
SECTION 10.9. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER
PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10.9 WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN
ALL INSTANCES.

Section 10.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 10.11 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument, and shall become effective when one (1) or more such counterparts
have been signed by each party and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail,
or otherwise) to the other party.

 



-84 Section 10.12 _Expenses._ Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except
as set forth otherwise in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

 

Section 10.13 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption._ It is understood and
agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any
specific item in Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules
is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall
use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of
any such item in Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or included in
Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Nothing herein (for the avoidance of
doubt, including Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules) shall be deemed an admission by either party or any of its
Affiliates, in any Proceeding or action, that such party or any such
Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in
default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any
Contract. For the purposes of this Agreement, (a) words in the singular shall
be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall
be held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b) references to
the terms Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to
the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereto," and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement,
including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto; (d) references to "dollars" or
"$" shall mean U.S. dollars; (e) the word "including" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall mean
"including without limitation," unless otherwise specified; (f) the word "or"
shall not be exclusive; (g) references to "written" or "in writing" include
in electronic form; (h) provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to
successive events and transactions; (i) the headings contained in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; (j) Sellers and Purchaser have
each participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation
should arise, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties thereto and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening either party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents; (k) a reference to any Person includes such Persons
successors and permitted assigns; (l) any reference to "days" means calendar
days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and (m) when calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the last
day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 10.14 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Sellers, USF and Sysco agree that neither they
nor any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Party or

 



-85  Financing Related Party in connection with or related to this Agreement, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In addition, no
Financing Party or Financing Related Party shall have any liability or
obligation to Sellers, USF, Sysco or any of their respective Representatives
in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including for any consequential,
special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not modify or alter in any respect
any provision of any Definitive Agreements (including the Commitment Letter)
between or among Purchaser and any Financing Party or Financing Related Party
entered into in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement, and in
the event of a conflict between the foregoing and any provision in any such
Definitive Agreements (including the Commitment Letter), the provisions of
such Definitive Agreements (including the Commitment Letter) shall govern and
control.
