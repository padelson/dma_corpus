iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of March
23, 2009, by and among Victory Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), VAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), TouchTunes Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Company_ "), VantagePoint CDP Partners, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (" _Vantage_ " or the " _Stockholder_ ").

RECITALS

 

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (as defined
in Section 1.1) and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ ") and other applicable law, Parent and the Company intend to
enter into a business combination transaction by means of a merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity
and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ ").

B. The board of directors of each of Parent and the Company has determined
that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, its respective
company and stockholders.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows (defined terms used in this Agreement are listed
alphabetically in Article IX, together with the Section and, if applicable,
paragraph number in which the definition of each such term is located):

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, the Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in
the Merger (" _Surviving Corp_ "). The term " _Agreement_ " as used herein
refers to this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, as the same may be
amended from time to time, and all schedules hereto (including the
Company Schedule and the Parent Schedule, as defined in the preambles to
Articles II and III hereof, respectively).

1.2  _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined),
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DGCL (the time of such filing, or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger
being the " _Effective Time_ "). Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing"), other than the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, shall take place at the offices of Graubard Miller,
counsel to Parent, 405 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10174-1901 at a
time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than
the fifth (5th) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and location
as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). Closing
signatures may be transmitted by facsimile or by emailed PDF file.

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the

1.11, (i) each share of Company Common Stock (as defined in Section
2.3(a)(i)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be automatically converted (subject to Section 1.5(f)) into the right to
receive the Exchange Amount of shares of Parent common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), plus the pro rata portion of
any additional shares of Parent Common Stock payable with respect to such
share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.16 and (ii) each share of
Company Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 2.3(a)(i)) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically
converted (subject to Section 1.5(h)) into the right to receive the Exchange
Amount of shares of Parent Common Stock, _multiplied by_ the Conversion Rate
with respect thereto, _plus_ the pro rata portion of any additional shares of
Parent Common Stock payable with respect to such shares of Company Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 1.16, _plus_ , if the Merger constitutes a
Liquidation Event under the Companys Charter Documents, with respect only to

purpose any participating preference payable in respect of any series of
Preferred Stock).

" _Initial Parent Common Stock Consideration_ " means, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, 33,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, _minus_ , if

warrants then outstanding.

to the Effective Time, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable by the Company pursuant to the agreements and instruments that are
set forth on _Schedule 2.2(b)_ and _(c)_ , other than the Convertible Note of

_Vantage Note_ "), which is being repaid in cash at the Closing, and assuming
for such purpose that all Company Preferred Stock is converted to Company
Common Stock at the Conversion Rate (and ignoring for such purpose any
participating preference payable in respect of any series of Preferred Stock).

" _Unvested Option Shares_ " means, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be issuable

extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

(e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The number of shares of Parent Common

Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock), cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and each Person who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
of such fractional share, one (1) share of Parent Common Stock.



 

7 (g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All the Merger Shares
issued to the Recipients upon consummation of the Merger shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the

or Parent of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(h) _Required Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(i) _Unused Barfly Shares_. If at any time, any shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Unused Barfly_ _Shares_ ") that were held for issuance (or unvested)
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 26, 2008,
among the Company, NBM Merger Sub, Inc., National Broadcast Media Corp. and
James C. Weaver, as Company Shareholders Representative (the "Barfly
Agreement"), are not issuable (or will not become vested) because the
conditions to the issuance (or vesting) of such shares set forth in the Barfly
Agreement become incapable of being satisfied, then the Unused Barfly Shares
shall be issued to the Recipients, and held for issuance to the holders at the
Closing of the Warrants and Other Rights (other than holders of rights to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Barfly Agreement), with
the exercise prices and other terms of such Warrants and Other Rights
proportionately adjusted (or issued to any such holders to the extent such
Warrants and Other Rights have received shares of Parent Common Stock as a
result of the exercise or otherwise pursuant to the terms of such Warrants
and Other Rights). The allocation of the Unused Barfly Shares to the
Recipients and the holders at the Closing of Warrants and Other Rights shall
be made in the same proportion as their share of the total Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (on
a converted-to-Company Common Stock basis and ignoring for such purpose any
participating preference payable in respect of any Preferred Stock). 

1.6 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in
Section 5.1(a)), Parent shall appoint a reputable bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the issuance of the Merger
Shares. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Company that Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ ") is acceptable as Exchange
Agent.

(b) The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by Section
1.5 and any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, except for
manifest mathematical error. Parent shall deliver all necessary information
and provide such instructions as necessary to the Exchange Agent for the
implementation of the computations provided for herein or as shall be
necessary or desirable fully to effect the issuances and payments required
under Section 1.5.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to each holder of Company Common Stock a letter of transmittal in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company (" _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), together with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined
in Section 5.1(a)) and such other documentation as Parent may direct, with
respect to the surrender and delivery by each such holder of his, her or its
Company Certificates in exchange for Merger Shares as contemplated by Section
1.5. Upon return receipt by the Exchange Agent of a validly executed and
delivered Letter of Transmittal, the Exchange Agent shall issue to the
corresponding Recipient the number of Merger Shares (less the applicable
Escrow Shares), and the Company Certificates shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Company Certificates will be deemed, from
and after the  



 

8  Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Shares pursuant to Section 1.5. Separate certificates shall be issued
for each Recipients Escrow Shares (as defined in Section 1.11) and for the
balance of the Merger Shares to which such Recipient is entitled.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in trust with the
Exchange Agent, the aggregate Merger Shares (less the Escrow Shares).

(e) [Intentionally omitted.]

(f) If payment is to be made to a Recipient other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Company Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Company Certificate so surrendered must be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person who
surrenders the Company Certificate must provide funds for payment of any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the surrendered Company Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

(g) At any time which is more than 180 days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any Merger
Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent and have not been disbursed in
accordance with Article I of the Agreement, and after the shares have been
delivered to Parent, Persons entitled to Merger Shares in accordance with
Article I shall be entitled to look solely to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for issuance thereof upon surrender
of the Company Certificates held by them. Any Merger Shares remaining
unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such shares
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be liable to any Person entitled
to payment under Article I for any consideration which is delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

1.7 _No Distributions Until Surrender of Company Certificates_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holders of any Company Certificates that have not yet been
surrendered with respect to the Merger Shares to be issued upon surrender
thereof until the holders of record of such Company Certificates shall
surrender such certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Company Certificates, Parent shall promptly deliver to the
record holders thereof, without interest, the certificates representing the
Merger Shares issued in exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such Merger Shares.

1.8 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
certificates representing the Merger Shares that the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Company
Certificates were converted into and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7; provided, however, that, as a condition precedent to
the issuance of such certificates representing Merger Shares and other
distributions, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates shall indemnify Parent against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Surviving Corp with respect to the Company Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.
The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income
Tax Regulations.

1.10  _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest Parent with full right, title and  



 

9  possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Parent, the then current officers and directors
of Parent, and the officers and directors of the Company shall take all such
lawful and necessary action.

1.11 _Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnification obligations set
forth in Article VII of this Agreement, 10% of the Merger Shares, excluding
the Escrowed EBITDA Shares, issuable in the Merger (the " _Escrow Shares_ "),
shall be deposited in escrow (the " _Escrow Account_ "), which shall be
allocated among the Recipients in the same proportion as their proportionate
share of the total Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (on a converted-to-Company Common
Stock basis and ignoring for such purpose any participating preference payable
in respect of any Preferred Stock), all in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing between
Parent, the Representative, and Continental (or such other Person as may be
agreed by Parent and the Representative), as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_
"), substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_
"). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that on the 30th day after the date
Parent has filed with the SEC its Annual Report for the year ending December
31, 2009 on Form 10-K, but in no event later than twelve months after
the Closing (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release
the Escrow Shares, less that portion thereof applied in satisfaction of or
reserved with respect to indemnification claims in connection with claims made
pursuant to Section 7.1(a) of this Agreement (" _Escrow Claims_ "). Any
Escrow Shares due to be released on the Escrow Release Date that continue to
be held with respect to any unresolved Escrow Claim shall be delivered to the
Recipients in the same proportions as originally deposited into escrow,
promptly upon such resolution, subject to reduction, if any, for the
indemnification obligation associated with such resolved Escrow Claim.

1.12 _Committee and Representative for Purposes of Escrow Agreements_.

(a) _Parent Committee_. Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall appoint a committee consisting of one or more of its then members to
act on behalf of Parent to take all necessary actions and make all decisions
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement (as
defined in Section 1.16). In the event of a vacancy in such committee, the
board of directors of Parent shall appoint as a successor a Person who was a
director of Parent prior to the Closing Date or, in the event of an inability
to appoint same, another Person who would qualify as an "independent"
director of Parent and who has not had any relationship with the Company or
the Stockholder prior to the Closing. Such committee is intended to be the "
_Committee_ " referred to in Article VII hereof and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) _Representative_. Vantage is hereby appointed by the Company (and by
execution of this Agreement hereby accepts such appointment) as the
representative of the Recipients (the " _Representative_ "), with respect to
the taking by the Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement. Should
the Representative resign or be unable to serve, a new Representative will be
selected jointly by a vote of the Recipients who, at Closing, received a
majority of the Merger Shares, whose appointment shall be effective upon
execution by such successor of a joinder agreement providing for such
successor to become a party to the Escrow Agreement, the EBITDA Shares Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement as the Representative, in which case such
successor shall for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
and EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement be the Representative (and the prior acts
taken by the succeeded Representative shall remain valid for purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement). If
such Recipients are unable to appoint a Person to serve in the capacity of
Representative within 15 days of the date that the former
Representative resigned or became unable to serve, a new Representative shall
be selected by majority vote of those Persons on Parents board of directors
who served on the board of directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Representative shall not be liable to Recipients for any
liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred without gross
negligence by the Representative while acting in good faith and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the  



 

10  advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). From and
after the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Representative shall be final, binding and conclusive and not subject to
challenge by any Recipient. Parent and Surviving Corporation are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by Representative
and any acts done by Parent or Surviving Corporation in accordance with any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative. Parent,
Parent and each of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to rely upon,
and shall be fully protected in relying upon, the power and authority of the
Representative without independent investigation.

1.13 _Stockholder Matters_.

(a) Each Stockholder for himself, herself or itself only, represents and
warrants as follows:

(i) he, she or it has had both the opportunity to ask questions and receive
answers from the officers and directors of Parent and all persons acting on
Parents behalf concerning the business and operations of Parent and to obtain
any additional information to the extent Parent possesses or may possess such
information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or
expense necessary to verify the accuracy of such information;

(ii) he, she or it has had access to the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement;

(iii) that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder
does not, and the performance of his, her or its obligations hereunder will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with
or notification to, any _Governmental Entity_ (as defined), except (1) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act, state securities laws (" _Blue Sky
Laws_ "), and the rules and regulations thereunder, and (2) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 10.2(a)) on such Stockholder or the Company or, after the
Closing, Parent, or prevent consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent
the parties hereto from performing their material obligations under this
Agreement; and

(iv) that he, she or it owns the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock listed on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ as being owned by him, her or it free and
clear of all Liens.

1.14 _Shares Subject to Appraisal Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 1.5 hereof, Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 1.14(b)) shall not be converted into a right to receive Merger
Shares. The holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to
payment for such shares pursuant to the DGCL shall receive payment therefor
from Parent in accordance with the DGCL, provided, however, that (i) if any
stockholder of the Company who asserts appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger (a " _Dissenter_ ") shall have failed to establish his entitlement to
such rights as provided in the DGCL, or (ii) if any such Dissenter shall have
effectively withdrawn his demand for payment for such shares or waived or lost
his right to payment for his shares under the appraisal rights process under
the DGCL, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenter shall be
treated as if they had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right
to receive the Merger Shares as provided in Section 1.5. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands for payment received by the Company
from a person asserting appraisal rights, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands or negotiate or enter into any agreement with respect thereto.

(b) As used herein, " _Dissenting Shares_ " means any shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock held by Persons who are entitled to
appraisal rights under the DGCL, and who have properly exercised, perfected
and not subsequently withdrawn or lost or waived their rights to demand
payment with respect to those shares in accordance with the DGCL. 



 

11 1.15 _Treatment of the Company Derivative Securities_. Each option to
purchase Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Prior Option_ ") shall, at the Effective Time, be
cancelled and substituted with an option (the " _Substitute Option_ ") under
the Parent Plan (as defined Section 5.1(a)) to purchase that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Prior Option immediately before the
Effective Time by the Exchange Amount (and rounding down to the nearest whole
number). The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock of each
Substitute Option shall be equal to the aggregate exercise price for all
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the associated Prior Option divided
by the number of shares of Parent Company Stock subject to the Substitute
Option. The Substitute Option shall otherwise have the same terms and
conditions (including exercise periods) as were applicable under the
associated Prior Option. The option substitution described in this Section
1.15 shall be made with respect to nonqualified stock options in accordance
with Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and with respect to incentive stock
options in accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.424-1. Each warrant to purchase and
other right to receive Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock set
forth on Schedule 2.3(c) (the " _Warrants and Other Rights_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, remain outstanding and become, in accordance with its terms, a warrant
to purchase or other right to receive Parent Common Stock, on the terms set
forth in such warrant or other right, and Parent hereby agrees to assume the
obligations under such warrants and rights (and take all commercially
reasonable efforts to execute and deliver documentation to the holders
thereof evidencing such assumption). The Warrants and Other Rights shall be
further adjusted pursuant to Section 1.16, if the EBITDA Satisfaction Event
occurs.

1.16 _EBITDA Shares_.

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall issue the Escrowed EBITDA Shares, which
shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent and held pursuant to the terms of the
escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (the "
_EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement_ "). The EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement shall
provide for the Escrowed EBITDA Shares to be either (i) delivered to the
Recipients and the holders of Substitute Options (" _Option Holders_ ") in the
same proportion as their proportionate share of the total Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (on
a converted-to-Company Common Stock basis and ignoring for such purpose any
participating preference payable in respect of any Preferred Stock, and, in
the case of Option Holders, the proportionate share is based on the shares of
Company Common Stock covered by the Prior Options held by the Option Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time) or (ii) returned to Parent
for cancellation, as provided in this Section 1.16.

(b) Not more than 5 business days after the filing of the Parents Form 10-K
or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, after the end of each fiscal quarter,
beginning with the second fiscal quarter end following the Effective Time,
Parent shall determine the EBITDA for the previous two fiscal quarters, taken
together as a single period, and deliver to Representative a statement (the "
_EBITDA Statement_ ") setting forth Parents calculation of EBITDA for such
fiscal quarters, with appropriate detail showing the calculations made
therein.

 

(c) If, within 30 days following receipt of the EBITDA Statement by
Representative, Representative has not given Parent written notice of
objection to such EBITDA Statement, then the EBITDA Statement shall be deemed
final and binding on the parties. The EBITDA Statement shall also be deemed
final and binding when Representative delivers written notice to Parent that
it agrees with the calculations set forth in the EBITDA Statement. If
Representative gives such notice of objection, and the items in dispute cannot
be resolved by agreement between Parent and Representative within 10 days
following Parents receipt of Representatives written objection, the issues
in dispute will be submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution,
with instructions to the Independent Accountant to determine EBITDA in
accordance with the definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement.
If issues in dispute are submitted to the Independent Accountant for
resolution, (a) each of Parent and Representative will furnish to the
Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent  



 

12  Accountant may request and are available to it and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accountant any material relating to
the determination and to discuss the determination with the Independent
Accountant; (b) the determination by the Independent Accountant of Adjusted
EBITDA, as set forth in a written notice delivered to Parent and
Representative by the Independent Accountant, will be final and binding on
the parties, absent manifest error; and (c) Parent shall pay the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant in connection with such determination.

(d) If EBITDA, as measured at the end of any fiscal quarter, determined
pursuant to Section 1.16 above, is equal to or greater than $50 million (the
" _EBITDA Satisfaction Event_ "), then Parent and Representative shall, within
5 business days after EBITDA is final and binding on the parties, instruct the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the EBITDA Shares Escrow Agreement to release
the Escrowed EBITDA Shares to the Recipients and Option Holders (whether or
not such Substitute Options remain outstanding at such time, provided,
however, that Escrowed EBITDA Shares released to Option Holders shall be
subject to the same vesting requirements as the associated Substitute Options
and, if before the release of Escrowed EBITDA Shares, an Option Holder has
forfeited all or a portion of a Substituted Option, the Option Holder shall
forfeit the Escrowed EBITDA Shares to the same extent).

(e) Upon the occurrence of the EBITDA Satisfaction Event, all Warrants and
Other Rights shall be further adjusted in accordance with their terms.

(f) If any Parent Common Stock is issued in respect of any Warrants and Other
Rights prior to the EBITDA Satisfaction Event, then promptly following the
EBITDA Satisfaction Event, Parent shall issue to the former holders of such
Warrants and Other Rights, such number of additional shares of Parent Common
Stock as such holders would have received if such shares of Parent Common
Stock were issued after the EBITDA Satisfaction Event (giving effect to the
adjustments provided for in Section 1.16(e)).

(g) If an EBITDA Satisfaction Event has not occurred on or prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing of the Merger, all certificates evidencing the
Escrowed EBITDA Shares shall be returned to Parent and the same shall be
immediately cancelled.

(h) The following terms have the following meanings, for purposes of this
Agreement:

" _Aggregate EBITDA Shares_ " means 9,500,000 shares of Parent Common Stock.

" _EBITDA_ " means, for any period of two fiscal quarters, an amount
determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP for Parent and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, equal to their (i) net income, _plus_ (ii) interest
expense, _plus_ (iii) income Taxes, _plus_  (iv) depreciation expense, _plus_
(v) amortization expense, _plus_ (vi) non-recurring, non-operating expense, in
each case for such period.

" _Escrowed EBITDA Shares_ " means (i) the Aggregate EBITDA Shares,
_multiplied by_ (A) (1) the Issued Company Shares, plus (2) the Total Company
Option Shares, _divided by_ (B) (1) the Total Company Option and Warrant
Shares _plus_ (2) the Issued Company Shares, minus (3) the Unvested Option
Shares.

" _Independent Accountant_ " means any nationally recognized independent
registered public accounting firm appointed by mutual agreement of Parent and
Representative.

" _Total Company Option Shares_ " means, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be

permits described in _Schedule 2.5(b)_ , and (iv) where the failure to obtain

planned to be conducted. Parent is in possession of all Approvals necessary to
own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted by Parent, except

Parent is not in violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

(b) Parent is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each jurisdiction in which Parent is so
qualified or licensed is listed in _Schedule 3.1_.

directors), and  



 

27  no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are

breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair Parents or
Merger Subs rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien on any of the properties
or assets of Parent pursuant to, any Parent Contracts, except, with respect
to clauses (ii) or (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences that would not, individually and in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

not, and the performance of their respective obligations hereunder will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) for applicable

Laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and appropriate documents
with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which Parent or Merger
Sub is qualified to do business, (ii) for the filing of any notifications
required under the HSR Act and the expiration of the required waiting period
thereunder, and (iii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would

Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or prevent consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent the parties hereto from performing their obligations under
this Agreement.

3.6 _Compliance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has complied with and is not
in violation of any Legal Requirements with respect to the conduct of its
business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for failures

any Legal Requirements has been received by Parent or Merger Sub (and Parent
has no knowledge of any such notice delivered to any other Person). Neither

Adverse Effect on Parent.

28  amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then
on the date of such filing and as so amended or superseded) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except
to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence, Parent makes no
representation or warranty whatsoever concerning any Parent SEC Report as of
any time other than the date or period with respect to which it was filed.

rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was or (with respect
to filings after the date hereof) will be prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, do not contain footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange
Act) and each fairly presents or (with respect to filings after the date
hereof) will fairly present in all material respects the financial position
of Parent at the respective dates thereof and the results of its operations
and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent taken as a whole.

balance sheet or in the related notes to the financial statements included in
Parent SEC Reports that are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the

liabilities provided for in or otherwise disclosed in a balance sheet or in
the related notes to the financial statements included in Parent SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, and (ii) liabilities incurred since December
31, 2008 in the ordinary course of business, none of which would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Agreement, since December 31, 2008, there has not been: (i) any Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of

securities of Parent or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any
such shares or other securities, (iii) any split, combination or
reclassification of any of Parents capital stock, (iv) any granting by Parent

increases of cash compensation in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, or any payment by Parent of any bonus, except for bonuses
made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or
any granting by Parent of any increase in severance or termination pay or any
entry by Parent into any currently effective employment, severance,
termination or indemnification agreement or any agreement the benefits of
which are contingent or the terms of which are materially altered upon the
occurrence of a transaction involving Parent of the nature contemplated
hereby, (v) entry by Parent into any licensing or other agreement with regard
to the acquisition or disposition of any Intellectual Property other than

oral, to do any of the foregoing.

other arrangements (whether or not set forth in a written document and
including, without limitation, all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of _ERISA_ ) covering any active or former employee, director
or consultant of the Parent, or any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) which is under common control with the Parent within the meaning
of Section 414 of the Code (" _Parent Benefit Plan_ "), and neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any stockholder, director or employee of Parent, or (ii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits. Parent is not a party to any agreement, contract or arrangement
(including this Agreement) that would reasonably be likely to result,
separately or in the aggregate in the payment of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or future
transactions involving Parent. No Parent Benefit Plan provides for the
reimbursement of excise Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or any income
Taxes under the Code.

agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by
Parent and Parent does not know of any activities or proceedings of any labor
union to organize any such employees.

any business activities other than activities directed toward the
accomplishment of a business combination. Except as set forth in the Parent
Charter Documents, there is no agreement, commitment, judgment, injunction,
order or decree binding upon Parent or to which Parent is a party which has or
could reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially
impairing any business practice of Parent, any acquisition of property by
Parent or the conduct of business by Parent as currently conducted other than
such effects, individually or in the aggregate, which have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

3.14 _Title to Property_. Parent does not own or lease any real property or
personal property. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.14_ , there are no
options or other contracts under which Parent has a right or obligation to
acquire or lease any interest in real property or personal property.

any Tax authority prior to the date hereof, except such Returns which are not
material to Parent. All such Returns are true, correct and complete in all
material respects. Parent has paid all Taxes shown to be due on such Returns.

(b) All Taxes that Parent is required by law to withhold or collect have been
duly withheld or collected, and have been timely paid over to the proper
governmental authorities to the extent due and payable.

been accrued for in Parents books and records of account for the period for

any statute of limitations on or extending the period for the assessment or

writing, formally or informally, by any Tax authority to Parent or any
representative thereof.



 

30 (f) Parent has no liability for any unpaid Taxes which have not been accrued
for or reserved on Parents balance sheets included in the audited financial
statements for the most recent fiscal year ended, whether asserted or
unasserted, contingent or otherwise, other than any liability for unpaid Taxes
that may have accrued since the end of the most recent fiscal year in
connection with the operation of the business of Parent in the ordinary course
of business, none of which is material to the business, results of operations
or financial condition of Parent or, if any such amount is material, it has
been accrued on the books and records of Parent in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(g) Parent has not taken or agreed to take any action not provided for in
this Agreement (nor does Parent have knowledge of any fact or circumstance
whether or not specified or provided for in this Agreement) that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

3.16  _Environmental Matters_. Except for such matters that, individually or
in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent: (i) Parent has complied with all applicable Environmental

been associated with any release or threat of release of any Hazardous

notes, bonds, liens, license, permit, franchise, purchase orders, sales orders
or other understandings, commitments or obligations (including without

or lapse of time or both would become a breach of or default under, any Parent
Contract, and no party to any Parent Contract has given any written notice of
any claim of any such breach, default or event, which, individually or in the
aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Each agreement, contract or commitment to which Parent is a party or by which
it is bound that has not expired by its terms is in full force and effect,
except where such failure to be in full force and effect is not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Parent does not maintain any Insurance Policies.

3.21 _Interested Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC

reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of Parent; (b) to Parents knowledge,
none of such individuals has any direct or indirect ownership interest in any

intention by such entity to prohibit or terminate the listing of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSEA.

3.24 _Board Approval_. The board of directors of Parent (including any

full force and effect and, except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.26_ , will not
expire prior to December 31, 2009, and Parent is in compliance with all of its
obligations with respect thereto. No event has occurred and is continuing
which requires or permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would
require or permit, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any ancillary documents will not require or permit (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), any modification or termination of
any such Governmental Actions/Filings except such events which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
upon Parent.

Company, for itself and its subsidiaries, affiliated entities, directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, representatives, advisors and all other
associates and affiliates, and each Stockholder, for his, her or
itself, hereby waive all rights, title, interest or claim of any kind against

nature of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-of-
pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or
expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection
therewith), and (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part)
under any insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may
be covered under such insurance, and the Indemnifying Representative shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of Third Party Claim at its expense.

(b) _Defense_. The Indemnifying Representative shall have the right, at its
option (subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c) below) and

such Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Representative
reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided, however, that the

against an Indemnitee; or (iii) there is a reasonable probability that a Third
Party Claim may materially and adversely affect the Indemnitee other than as a
result of money damages or other money payments.

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to provide
copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant available data
shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any Third Party Claim
by an Indemnitee against the Indemnifying Representative and shall not affect
the Indemnifying Representatives duty or obligations under this Article VII,
except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have
adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying Representative to defend
against or reduce its liability or caused or increased such liability or
otherwise caused the damages to the Indemnitee to be greater than such
damages would have been had the Indemnified Representative given the
Indemnifying Representative prompt notice hereunder. So long as the
Indemnifying Representative is defending any such action actively and in good
faith, the Indemnified Representative shall not settle such action without the
consent of the Indemnifying Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Representative shall
make available to the Indemnifying Representative all relevant records and
other relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under the

notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Representative shall not, without the

action or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to each
of the Indemnitees of a full and unconditional release from all liability and
obligation in respect of such action without any payment by any Indemnitee.

consented to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the
settlement shall not be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss.

 7.3 _Insurance and Tax Effect_.

(a) To the extent that any Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Article VII are covered by insurance, the Indemnitees shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such

bring a claim for indemnification under this Article VII in respect of such
Losses.

(b) To the extent that any Losses that are subject to indemnification

termination of the Survival Period and any claim set forth in a Notice of
Claim sent prior to the expiration of such Survival Period shall survive until
final resolution thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) no claim for indemnification under this Article VII
shall be brought after the end of the Survival Period, and (ii) the
indemnification rights of the Indemnitees under this Article VII shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect; _provided_ that, until the
first anniversary of the Escrow Release Date (the " _Extended Indemnity
Period_ "), a Company Indemnitee may bring a claim for indemnification under
this Article VII for any claims, action, suit or proceeding, to the extent
arising out of or resulting from the actions taken by Parent in accordance
with Section 5.20 or any agreement between Parent and the Company contemplated
thereby. For purposes of the _proviso_ in this subsection (b), any
indemnification claim made by a Company Indemnitee in writing prior to the

subsequent expiration of the Extended Indemnity Period and any claim
set forth in a Notice of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such Extended
Indemnity Period shall survive until final resolution thereof.

Indemnitee unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses
otherwise payable to Parent Indemnitees exceeds $500,000 (the " _Deductible_

the Deductible. No amount shall be payable under Article VII to a Company

otherwise payable to Company Indemnitees exceeds the Deductible, in which
event the amount payable shall be only the amount in excess of the Deductible.

Losses pursuant to Section 7.1(c) shall not in any event exceed an amount of
shares of Parent Common Stock equivalent to the Escrow Shares as of the

to include any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages.

all claims for damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be

limit an Indemnitees right to bring any claim, demand or suit against the
other party based upon such other partys actual fraud.

Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the "purchase price" paid

Company and Parent, except as otherwise required by Law.

7.7 _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares_. The parties
acknowledge that the Representatives obligations under this Article VII are
solely as a representative of the Recipients in the manner set forth in the
Escrow Agreement and under this Article VII and that the Representative shall
have no personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by him in such
capacity and that all payments to the Parent Indemnitees as a result of such
indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and to the extent of,
the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of the Representative
for attorneys fees and other costs shall be borne in the first instance by
Parent, which may make a claim for reimbursement thereof against the Escrow
Shares upon the claim with respect to which such expenses are incurred
becoming an Established Claim (as defined in the Escrow Agreement). The
parties further acknowledge that all actions to be taken by the Parent
Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken on their behalf by the
Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the Closing, may apply
all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow Agent will hold the
remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution of all claims
for indemnification or disputes relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, all Escrow Shares remaining in escrow following
the Final Escrow Release Date in excess of the Escrow Shares necessary to
satisfy any timely filed claim for indemnification shall be released and
delivered to the Persons entitled to them on such date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Representative shall have no
liability to the Company or any Stockholder or any party hereto for any action
taken or omitted to be taken hereunder, unless such liability is determined by
a judgment or a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Representative. Parent shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Representative for all losses,
damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs
of investigation) arising out of or in connection with, the performance by
the Representative of its duties and obligations under this Agreement, unless
such liability is determined by a judgment or a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, or willful
misconduct of the Representative.

7.8 _Indemnification of Company Indemnitee_. In the event that a Company
Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified by Parent for Losses incurred by such
Company Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VII, Parent shall issue to such
Company Indemnitee shares of Parent Common Stock (subject to Section 7.4(d))
with a Fair Market Value (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) equal to the
amount of such Losses. In the event that Losses suffered by a Company
Indemnitee are as a result of Losses suffered by Parent (by virtue of their
ownership interest in Parent), then each Company Indemnitee shall be entitled
to recover a percentage of such losses equal to such Company Indemnitees
percentage ownership of Parent Common Stock.

Section 8.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
breach by the Company or such Stockholder is cured during such thirty
(30)-day period); or

(f) by either Parent or the Company, if, at the Special Meeting (including any
adjournments thereof), this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

Parent Common Stock issued in Parents initial public offering and outstanding
as of the date of the record date of the Special Meeting exercise their rights
to convert the shares of Parent Common Stock held by them into cash in
accordance with Parents certificate of incorporation.

(g) by Parent if (i) within 24 hours after the date hereof, Vantage has not
delivered to Parent an irrevocable agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to vote all shares of Company Common Stock and
Preferred Stock owned by Vantage for approval of this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (provided that the right to terminate pursuant to this
Section 8.3(g)(i) shall terminate at the time such agreement has been
delivered) or (ii) 2008 Audited Financial Statements have not been delivered
by April 2, 2009

which shall be considered one and the same document and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile or electronic transmission to
counsel for the other party of a counterpart executed by a party shall be
deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

 

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and

subject matter hereof (except to the extent expressly stated to survive the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby); and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder (except as specifically provided in
this Agreement).

10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

10.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the
law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

10.8 _Arbitration_. Any disputes or claims arising under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be resolved
by binding arbitration. Notice of a demand to arbitrate a dispute by either
party shall be given in writing to the other at their last known address.
Arbitration shall be commenced by the filing by a party of an arbitration
demand with the American Arbitration Association  



 

56  (" _AAA_ "). The arbitration and resolution of the dispute shall be resolved
by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA pursuant to AAA rules. The
arbitration shall in all respects be governed and conducted by applicable AAA
rules, and any award and/or decision shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware. The
arbitrator shall supply a written opinion supporting any award, and judgment
may be entered on the award in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party
shall pay its own fees and expenses for the arbitration, except that any costs
and charges imposed by the AAA and any fees of the arbitrator for his
services shall be assessed against the losing party by the arbitrator. In the
event that preliminary or permanent injunctive relief is necessary or
desirable in order to prevent a party from acting contrary to this Agreement
or to prevent irreparable harm prior to a confirmation of an arbitration
award, then either party is authorized and entitled to commence a lawsuit
solely to obtain equitable relief against the other pending the completion of
the arbitration in a court having jurisdiction over the parties. Each party
hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts
located in the State of Delaware, New Castle County, for such purpose.

10.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the first sentence of this Section
10.10, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

10.13 _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement shall
mean United States dollars.

10.14 _Schedules_. The information furnished in the Schedules is arranged in
sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement, and the disclosures
in any section of the Schedules shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (b) other Sections of this Agreement to the extent
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference), that it is clear
from a reasonable reading of the Schedules and such other Sections of this
Agreement that such disclosure is also applicable to such other Sections of
this Agreement. The Schedules and the information and disclosures contained
