however,_ that Acquiror or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record holder of
such Certificate to execute an indemnification agreement as Acquiror or the
Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and/or any of
their respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate.

4.9 _Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Adjustments_. Pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)(vii)_, the Company shall deliver the Net Working Capital Certificate
and the Closing Cash Certificate to Acquiror at or prior to the Closing, and a
draft thereof shall be delivered by the Company to Acquiror not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Acquiror and the Stockholders
Agent (each, an " _Objecting Party_ ") may object to the Net Working Capital
and/or the Company Cash calculations included in the Net Working Capital
Certificate and the Closing Cash Certificate, respectively (the " _NWC and
Cash Calculations_"), by delivering to Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent, as
applicable, a certificate (the " _NWC and Cash Objection Certificate_")
executed by the Objecting Party setting forth, as applicable, (i) the
Objecting Partys calculation of the Net Working Capital and the amount by
which Net Working Capital as calculated by the Objecting Party is greater or
less than the Net Working Capital set forth in the Net Working Capital
Certificate; and (ii) the Objecting Partys calculation of the Company Cash
and the amount by which the Company Cash as calculated by the Objecting Party
is greater or less than the Company Cash set forth in the Closing Cash
Certificate. In the event neither Acquiror nor the Stockholders Agent timely
delivers a NWC and Cash Objection Certificate, the Net Working Capital and the
Company Cash shall be definitively deemed to be as calculated in the Net
Working Capital Certificate and the Closing Cash Certificate delivered by the
Company at Closing.

 



13 (b) Acquiror and the Company acknowledge and agree that if an Objecting Party
has timely and validly delivered a NWC and Cash Objection Certificate to
Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent, as applicable, such recipient shall be
precluded from delivering another NWC and Cash Objection Certificate and instead
will deliver a Notice of Objection if it disagrees with the calculations, set
forth in the NWC and Cash Objection Certificate. In the event that Acquiror, as
the Objecting Party, has delivered a NWC and Cash Objection Certificate to
the Stockholders Agent, during the thirty (30) day period following receipt
of such NWC and Cash Objection Certificate, Acquiror shall permit Stockholders
Agent and its accountants, upon reasonable notice at a mutually agreed upon
time during normal business hours, to have full access to the books, records,
accountants and personnel of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation and to
make such inspections and copies of such books and records as they may
reasonably request, from time to time to verify the amounts included in the
NWC and Cash Objection Certificate.

(c) Whichever of the Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent, did not deliver the
NWC and Cash Objection Certificate, may object to the Net Working Capital and/or
Company Cash calculations set forth in the NWC and Cash Objection Certificate
received from the Objecting Party by providing written notice of such
objection to the Objecting Party within thirty (30) days after the Objecting
Partys delivery of the NWC and Cash Objection Certificate (the " _Notice
of Objection_ "). If an NWC and Cash Objection Certificate has been timely
delivered and Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent, as applicable, does not
timely deliver a Notice of Objection, the Net Working Capital and the
Company Cash shall be definitively deemed to be as calculated in the NWC and
Cash Objection Certificate.

(d) If Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent, as applicable, timely provides
the Notice of Objection, then the parties shall confer in good faith for a
period of up to ten (10) Business Days following the Objecting Partys timely
receipt of the Notice of Objection, in an attempt to resolve any disagreement
and any resolution by them shall be in writing and shall be final and binding.

(e) If, after such ten (10) Business Day period, the Stockholders Agent and
Acquiror cannot resolve any such disagreement, then the parties shall engage
the Independent Accounting Firm to review the NWC and Cash Calculations. After
review of the NWC and Cash Calculations and the Companys books and records, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall promptly determine the Net Working Capital
and Company Cash in accordance with and on a basis consistent with the
accounting methodologies, practices, estimates, techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and such
determination shall be final and binding on the parties.

(f) If the Net Working Capital, as determined pursuant to the foregoing
provisions is in fact less than the Net Working Capital set forth in the Net
Working Capital Certificate (such difference, the " _NWC Negative Adjustment
Amount_ "), then (subject to Section 4.9(j)) Acquiror shall be permitted to
recover from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the NWC Negative Adjustment
Amount,

 



14 (g) If the Company Cash, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions
is, in fact, less than the Company Cash set forth in the Closing Cash
Certificate (such difference, the " _Cash Negative Adjustment Amount_ "), then
(subject to Section 4.9(j)) Acquiror shall be permitted to recover from the
Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Cash Negative Adjustment Amount.

(h) If the Net Working Capital, as determined pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, is in fact greater than the Net Working Capital set forth in the
Net Working Capital Certificate (such difference, the " _NWC Positive
Adjustment Amount_ "), then (subject to Section 4.9(j)) Acquiror shall
promptly (but in any case within three (3) Business Days of the determination)
deliver an amount of cash equal to the NWC Positive Adjustment Amount to the

or, with respect to leased tangible properties and assets, including the Real

(c) _Schedule 5.8(c)_ identifies each site of real property in which the
Company and/or any Subsidiary leases, licenses, subleases, uses or occupies,
or has the right to use or occupy, now or in the future (collectively, the "

and sets forth the addresses for all Owned Real Properties. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary owns, or has in the past owned, any real property
other than the Owned Real Property. There are no purchase options of any kind
whereby any Person has acquired or will have any basis to assert any right to
purchase any part or all of the Owned Real Properties. There is no pending or,
to Companys knowledge, threatened condemnation or similar proceeding
affecting the whole or any portion of the Owned Real Properties. Requests
received by the Company for any repairs, restorations or improvements to the
Owned Real Properties and Facilities from any Governmental Authority or
insurance company or provider have resulted in said items being completed or
will lead to said items being completed in the ordinary course of business. No
portion of the Owned Real Property has suffered any material damage by fire
or other casualty which heretofore has not been repaired and restored. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 5.8(d)_, no Person other than the Company and/or
any Subsidiary owns any improvement located on the Owned Real Properties.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary have received any written notice of
any violation or alleged violation of applicable legal Requirements with
respect to the Companys use of the Owned Real Properties that remains
uncured. There are no material capital expenditures known to the Company or
any Subsidiary to be required to be made in connection with the Owned Real
Properties in order to comply with all applicable Legal Requirements. All
requisite certificates of occupancy and other licenses, consents, permits or
approvals required with respect to the Facilities and the occupancy and use
thereof have been obtained and are currently in effect.

and/or any Subsidiary.

 



26 (b) _Schedule 5.9(b)_ _-1_ lists all: (i) patents, patent applications ("
_Company Patent Rights_ "), registered trademarks and service marks, and
registered copyrights owned by the Company and/or each Subsidiary ("
_Scheduled Company Intellectual Property_ "), including where applicable the
jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign, in which each such item of
Intellectual Property has been issued or registered or in which any
application for such issuance and registration has been filed; (ii)
written licenses, sublicenses and other agreements as to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party and pursuant to which any Person is authorized to
use any Intellectual Property owned by the Company other than Standard

agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party and pursuant to

Party Intellectual Property Rights_ ") that are incorporated or used in any
product or service of the Company and/or each Subsidiary or which are
material to their respective operations other than Standard Inbound IP
Licenses; and (iv) all agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a

Company nor any Subsidiary is obligated to pay any royalties and/or fees to
any third party with respect to any Intellectual Property license, other than
under those licenses listed in _Schedule 5.9(b)_. None of the Company Patent

Rights are subject to a compulsory license, or (ii) an opinion, whether
preliminary in nature or qualified in any manner, which concludes that a
challenge to the validity or enforceability of any of the Company Patent
Rights would reasonably succeed.

(d) No allowable or allowed subject matter of the Company Patent Rights listed
in _Schedule 5.9(d)_ as being solely owned by the Company is subject to any
competing or interfering claims by any third party. No allowable or allowed

examination or opposition proceedings.

and registration of all Scheduled Company Intellectual Property material to
the operation of the Company and/or each Subsidiary. Except as set forth on

or other fees necessary to maintain the pendency or right to assert the
Company Patent Rights due on or before the date hereof have been paid
according to proper entity status in the relevant jurisdiction. The
registrations to Company Patent Rights are in good standing and none of the
Company Patent Rights have lapsed, been disclaimed or otherwise voluntarily
limited in scope, or been dedicated to the public other than as indicated in 
_Schedule 5.9(b)_ _-1_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.9(e)_, neither
the Company nor any

complaint, claim, demand or notice that the Company or any Subsidiary has
infringed, misappropriated, or acted in conflict with any of the Intellectual
Property owned by any third party.

to the Company, by any third party, including any employee or former employee
of the Company and/or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has, in the three (3) years preceding the date of this Agreement, sent to
any third party any written charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice
asserting that such Person has infringed, misappropriated, or acted in
conflict with any of the Intellectual Property owned by the Company, nor (to
the Companys knowledge) is any such infringement, misappropriation, or
conflict occurring or threatened, other than as disclosed in _Schedule
5.9(f)_.

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is, nor will be, as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, or the performance of
its obligations hereunder, in material breach of any license, sublicense or
other agreement.

(h) The conduct of the business of the Company and/or any Subsidiary
as presently conducted does not infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise
violate any Intellectual Property of any third party.

 

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.9(i)_, each current and former
officer, employee and consultant of the Company and each Subsidiary has
executed and delivered to the Company and/or one of its Subsidiaries an
agreement in substantially the form or forms made available by the Company to
Acquiror, providing that the Company and/or such Subsidiary will become
or may elect to become the owner or assignee of any Intellectual Property
such Person creates within the scope of his or her employment or in the case
of a non-employee, from the services such Person performs for the Company
and/or any Subsidiary, unless or except to the extent that the Company and/or
any Subsidiary is entitled to become or elects to become the owner or assignee
of such Intellectual Property by operation of law.

 

(j) The Intellectual Property that is used by the Company and/or each
Subsidiary in the conduct of their respective businesses was either (i)

irrevocably assigned or otherwise properly and irrevocably transferred to or
vested in the Company and/or its Subsidiaries pursuant to written agreements;

to a license, assignment, equitable right, or other contract that is in full
force and effect and under which neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
material breach.

sole discretion, determine is required by applicable securities Legal
Requirements; _provided, however,_ that Acquiror shall consult with the
Company (if prior to the Closing) or the Stockholders Agent (if after the
Closing) regarding the content and timing of any such public announcement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
Closing, the Stockholders Agent shall be permitted to, after the public
announcement of the Merger, publicly announce that it has been engaged to
serve as the Stockholders Agent in connection with the Merger as long as such
announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated therein.

 

(c) The Company hereby acknowledges, agrees and covenants to Acquiror to
undertake reasonable efforts to both inform and make aware each Stockholder
that all Transaction Information known or obtained by such Stockholder,
whether before or after the Closing Date, is the property, as appropriate, of
the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror. Furthermore, such Stockholder shall
agree, in the case of any Stockholder, pursuant to his, her or

 



54  its Letter of Transmittal and Release, that he, she or it will not, at any
time, disclose or cause to be disclosed to any unauthorized persons (other
than to such Stockholders accountants, attorney and advisors that are bound
by a duty or contractual obligation of confidentiality and to the
Stockholders Agent) or use or cause to be used for his, her or its own
account or for the benefit of any third party any Transaction Information,
whether such Stockholder has such information in such Stockholders memory or
embodied in writing or other physical form or any computer readable format,
without Acquirors prior, written consent, unless and to the extent
that disclosure is required by applicable Legal Requirements (in which event
such Stockholder shall give Acquiror as much notice of such disclosure as is
practicable and permitted by Legal Requirements and shall cooperate with
Acquiror, at Acquirors cost and expense, to obtain appropriate protective

Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Company. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that there is any

into with Acquiror or the Surviving Company, the terms and conditions of such
written agreement shall control.

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that notwithstanding the
foregoing, there is no due diligence condition to Acquirors obligation to
proceed to Closing. No information or knowledge obtained by Acquiror during

the Company unpaid by the Company by the Closing Date shall be borne by the
Stockholders as Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the terms hereof. Any
Transaction Expenses incurred prior to the termination of this Agreement and
that by the terms of this Agreement are to be borne by a party shall be paid
by such party accordingly, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.

8.11  _Employees and Contractors_. Not more than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, and subject to the Companys consent, which may not be
unreasonably withheld, Acquiror shall have the right to direct the Company to
terminate the employment of those employees of the Company set forth in
Acquirors written notice to the Company (the " _Designated Employees_ ").
Effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall
terminate the employment of each of the Designated Employees. Acquiror shall

and Liabilities related to any such termination of the Companys 401(k)
Plan(s) (the " _401(k) Termination Expenses_ "). 

8.13 _Certain Closing Certificates and Documents_. The Company shall prepare
and deliver to Acquiror, a draft of each of the Net Working Capital

copies of the documents or instruments evidencing the amounts set forth on any
such draft or final certificate.

8.14 _Corporate Matters_. The Company shall, at the Closing, deliver to

actions and meetings of the Board of Directors, committees of the Board of
Directors and stockholders of the Company and the stock ledgers, journals and

8.15 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Company shall timely prepare and file, or
shall cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account any extensions) on or
prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall
deliver to Acquiror, for its review, comment and approval (which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of any Tax Return
no later than 10 days prior to the filing date of such Tax Return
(including extensions thereof), and, in connection with such review, Acquiror
shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to the Companys and each Subsidiaries financial books and records.
All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior
practice unless otherwise required by applicable law. The failure of Acquiror
to propose any changes to any such proposed Tax Return within 8 days after
having been provided with a final draft of such Tax Return shall be deemed to
constitute its approval thereof. The Company shall file or cause to be filed
all such Tax Returns and shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of any Taxes
shown due thereon to the appropriate Tax Authority.

 



59 (b) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Acquiror shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed in a timely manner all Tax
Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending prior to
or including the Closing Date which have not yet been filed as of the Closing
Date. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements. None of the Effective Date Holders, the Acquiror, the Company or
any Subsidiary will take any action, or permit any action to be taken, that
may prevent the taxable year of the Company from ending for federal and (to
the extent permitted) state, local and foreign income Tax purposes at the end
of the day on which the Closing occurs and shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, elect with the relevant taxing authority to
treat for all income Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period of the Company. At least 20 days prior to the date on which
each such Tax Return is filed, Acquiror shall submit such Tax Return to the
Stockholders Agent for the Stockholders Agents review and approval (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Not later than five (5)
days prior to the filing date of any such proposed Tax Return (including
extensions thereof) which has been reviewed and approved by the Stockholders
Agent, Acquiror shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Fund an amount
equal to that portion of the Taxes shown on such Tax Returns for which
Stockholders have an obligation to indemnify pursuant to _Section 11.1_.

(c) _Straddle Periods_. Acquiror, the Company and each of the Subsidiaries
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, close the
Taxable year of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date.
In any case where applicable Legal Requirements do not permit the Company or
its Subsidiaries to close its Taxable year on the Closing Date, then Taxes, if
any, attributable to the Taxable period of such entity beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date (such period, a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be
allocated (i) to the Stockholders for the period up to and including the
Closing Date, and (ii) to the Acquiror for the period subsequent to the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle
Period, the amount of any Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period that
includes the Closing Date: (i) in the case of real property,
personal property and other Taxes not imposed on the basis of income or
receipts, shall be based on a daily proration of such Taxes, and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes shall be based on an interim closing of the books of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Company or any Subsidiary holds a beneficial
interest shall be deemed to terminate as of the close of business on the
Closing Date).

(d) _Procedures Relating to Tax Audits_. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, Acquiror shall have full responsibility for and discretion
in handling any Tax controversy, including, without limitation, an audit,
assessment, investigation, administrative proceeding, a protest to any Tax
Authority and litigation in any other court or tribunal of competent
jurisdiction (collectively, a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") involving Acquiror, the
Company or any Subsidiary. However, the Stockholders Agent shall have the
right, at the sole expense of the Stockholders, to consult with Acquiror
regarding any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Taxes for which Stockholders
have an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section
11.1_. Acquiror agrees not to enter into any agreement or settlement with a
Tax Authority with respect to any Tax Proceeding involving any Taxes for which
the Stockholders have an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Persons
pursuant to  _Section 11.1_ without the

 



60  consent of the Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed. If the Stockholders Agent withholds its
consent to any agreement or settlement, all out-of-pocket expenses
subsequently incurred by the Acquiror, the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with any such Tax Proceeding shall be treated as a loss suffered by
the Indemnified Persons for purposes of  _Section 11.1_.

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

(f) _Cooperation_. Acquiror and Stockholders Agent shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, action, claim for
refund, contest, defense or other Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Acquiror, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Stockholders
Agent agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company or any Subsidiary relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. Acquiror,
the Company and the Stockholders Agent further agrees, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

(g) _No Limitation_. Nothing contained in this _Section 8.15_ shall in any
manner terminate, limit or adversely affect any right of the Indemnified
Persons to receive indemnification pursuant to any provisions of this
Agreement.

 

8.16 _Termination of Financing Statements_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary such that (a) all required documentation has been executed by each
Person holding a security interest in any assets of the Company as of the
Closing Date to terminate any and all such security interests upon payment of
the indebtedness giving rise to such security interest, and (b) UCC-2 or
UCC-3 termination statements, as applicable, will be filed promptly after
payment of the indebtedness giving rise to such security interest with respect
to each of the UCC-1 financing statements filed in order to perfect security
interests in assets of the Company that have not yet expired.

8.17 _Export Compliance_. The Company shall prepare and file all required
filings with the U.S. Commerce Department, including any required voluntary
disclosures, to be, or become, compliant with United States export
regulations. Any voluntary disclosures regarding any prior violations
of United States export regulations shall be prepared by the Company and/or
its counsel and shall not be filed without Acquirors consent (such consent
not to be reasonably withheld).

 



61 8.18 _Updating Company Disclosure Letter_. Between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly supplement or amend the
Company Disclosure Letter from time to time by specific notice to Acquiror
(each, a " _Schedule Supplement_ ") and deliver such Schedule Supplement to
Acquiror with respect to any matter, event, condition, fact, circumstance or
development that arises or of which the Company becomes aware after the date
hereof which, if existing, occurring or known at the Agreement Date would have
been required to be set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. To the extent
such updated information in a Schedule Supplement consists of developments
occurring prior to the Agreement Date, the disclosure in such Schedule
Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for
purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in 
_Section 9.3_ have been satisfied. To the extent such updated information in
a Schedule Supplement consists of developments occurring after the Agreement
Date and prior to the Effective Time, the disclosure in such
Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have amended or cured any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement for purposes of the termination rights contained in this Agreement
or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Section 9.3_
have been satisfied; but, if Acquiror has the right to, but does not elect to
terminate this Agreement within five (5) Business Days of its receipt of such
Schedule Supplement, then such schedule shall be deemed to be amended and
Acquiror shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any rights (including
rights to indemnification) with respect to the item set forth in such Schedule
Supplement.

 

8.19 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the existing
provisions of the Charter Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
concerning the elimination of liability and indemnification of directors
and/or other persons shall not be amended in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any person that is as of the date hereof or
the Effective Time covered as an indemnitee under any such elimination of
liability or indemnification provisions, unless such amendment or modification
shall be required by applicable Legal Requirements and then only to the
minimum extent required by such Legal Requirements. In addition to the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, or cause to be indemnified and
held harmless, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each person
who is, or at the Closing Date will be, a current or former director or
officer of the Company (the " _D andO Indemnitees_") against all liabilities,
obligations, fines, penalties, losses, settlements, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, reasonable costs and reasonable expenses
(including reasonable attorney fees) suffered or incurred by any DandO
Indemnities arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged
acts or omissions) of the DandO Indemnitees, or any of them, in their capacities
as such. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the
indemnification and related rights hereunder shall be mandatory rather
than permissible, and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses in connection
with such indemnification to the extent permitted by applicable law; provided,
however, that, as provided in the existing provisions of the constituent
documents of the Company and its subsidiaries, any DandO Indemnitees to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



62 (b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to and the Surviving Corporation shall cause its subsidiaries to,
procure and maintain in effect with respect to all periods prior to the
Closing Date, directors and officers liability insurance covering those
present and former officers and directors of the Company and those present and
former officers, directors and managers of the subsidiaries who are currently
covered by directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms no
less favorable in the aggregate than the terms of such current insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim is asserted or made
within such six (6) year period, such insurance shall be continued in respect
of such claim until the final disposition thereof; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, if such "tail" or other policies are not available at an annual cost not
greater than 150% (one hundred fifty percent) of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date hereof under such policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ "), then the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be obtained as much comparable insurance
as can reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment at a cost up to but
not exceeding the Insurance Cap.

(c) The provisions of this  _Section 8.19_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person released or entitled to
indemnification, or other benefit hereunder, and each such persons heirs,
representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.19_, and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other right to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise. The Surviving Corporation shall not, and Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to, amend the provisions of this _Section 8.19_ in
a manner that would adversely affect any such third party beneficiary without
the prior written consent of such third party beneficiary.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to), from time to time following the Closing, execute and deliver
such other documents and instruments and take such other actions as may be
reasonably requested by the Stockholders Agent or any DandO Indemnitee to
implement the provisions of this _Section 8.19_.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 8.19_ shall prohibit Acquiror from causing the
merger, consolidation, or reorganization of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries.

entering into such agreements shall not constitute a condition precedent for
Acquiror, Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation to consummate

terminating party, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval:

 



65 (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Companys Board of
Directors and by Acquiror;

(b) by either Acquiror or the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before the date that is 90 days from the date of this Agreement, or
such other date that Acquiror and the Company may agree upon in writing (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this

(d) by Acquiror, if (i) the Company shall have breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not
have been cured within five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Company of
written notice of such breach ( _provided, however,_ that no such cure period
shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot
be cured) and if not cured within the timeframe above and at or prior to the
Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.3_ to be satisfied, (ii) the Company
shall have breached _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_, or (iii) there

as provided in _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub,
the Company or their respective officers, directors, shareholders or

10.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article 1_ (Definitions and Interpretation)

Agreement in accordance with their terms, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve
any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from (i) any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation on or before the Termination Date with respect
to such partys representations and warranties contained herein or (ii) breach
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prevent a
party from pursuing any claim for breach of this Agreement (whether under

the parties hereto may amend this Agreement by authorized action at any time
before or after the Stockholder Approval pursuant to an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto ( _provided, however,_ that,
after such Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by
applicable Legal Requirements requires further approval by such Stockholders
without such further Stockholder approval). To the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, and, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement (including _Section 11.7_), Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent
may cause this Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no

obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in

breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of
the same or any other provision in this Agreement.

 

Article 11

 

ESCROW FUND, INDEMNIFICATION AND STOCKHOLDERS AGENT

11.1 _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Cash shall be deposited with JPMorgan Chase as
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), such deposit, together with any
interest that may be earned thereon, to constitute an escrow fund (the "
_Escrow Fund_ ") and to be governed by the provisions set forth herein and in
the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate
Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Acquiror Indemnified Person) for
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Stockholders. Any amounts released from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders
may be used by the Stockholders Agent for the same purposes as the
Stockholders Agent Expense Fund.

 



67 11.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and subject to the limitations set forth
in this Agreement, the Stockholders shall indemnify and hold harmless each of
the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror and their respective officers,
directors, stockholders, agents and employees, and each person, if any, who
controls or may control Acquiror within the meaning of the Securities Act
(each of the foregoing being referred to individually as an " _Acquiror
Indemnified Person_ " and collectively as " _Acquiror Indemnified Persons_ ")
from and against any and all losses, Liabilities, damages, fees, Tax,
interest, reasonable costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable costs
and reasonable expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of
action, including reasonable third party legal fees) whether or not due to a
third-party claim (collectively, " _Indemnifiable Damages_ "), arising out of
or resulting from ( _i_ ) any breach or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure
Letter (including any exhibit or Schedule to the Company Disclosure Letter),
( _ii_ ) any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or
agreements made by the Company in this Agreement, ( _iii_ ) any Indemnifiable
Closing Costs, ( _iv_ ) (a) all Taxes of the Company and each Subsidiary for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing and the portion through
the end of the Closing Date for any Straddle Period, (b) all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which the Company or any Subsidiary was a member prior to the Closing and (c)
all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary as a
transferee of or successor to such Person or as a result of any obligation to
assume such Taxes or to indemnify such Person, but in each case only to the
extent (x) such Taxes have not been included in the calculation of Net Working
Capital as finally determined and (y) such Taxes exceed in the aggregate the
amount of all Tax refunds for Taxable periods that end on or before the
Closing Date that were actually received by the Company after the Closing, and
not otherwise required to be returned to a Governmental Entity, and that were
not included in the calculation of Net Working Capital as finally determined,
and ( _v_ ) the special indemnity set forth in _Schedule 11.2(a)_ _(v)_ to
this Agreement (the " _Specified IP Claim_ ").

(b) From and after the Effective Time and subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Stockholders and their respective officers, directors,
stockholders, agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or
may control the Stockholders within the meaning of the Securities Act (each
of the foregoing being referred to individually as a " _Seller Indemnified
Person_ " and collectively as " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Damages, arising out of or resulting from
(i) any breach or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the
Acquiror or the Merger Sub in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of or default in
connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Acquiror or
the Merger Sub in this Agreement, and (iii) any termination of any Designated
Employee pursuant to _Section 8.11_, including all Designated Separation
Expenses, and (iv) any termination of the Companys 401(k) Plan(s) pursuant
to _Section 8.12_, including all 401(k) Termination Expenses.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, materiality
standards or qualifications in any representation or warranty shall only be
taken into account in determining whether a breach of such representation or
warranty exists, and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount
of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such breach.

 



68 11.3 _Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Other Limitations_.

 

(a) Subject to the Stockholders Agents right to indemnification from the
Stockholders under Section 11.7(b), no party shall have any Liability for
indemnification under this Agreement, including, without limitation, under
this _Article 11_ , for any Indemnifiable Damages that is individually less
than Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), except
for claims ( _i_ ) arising from, or related to, breaches of Fundamental
Representations or fraud, or ( _ii_ ) pursuant to clauses (ii) through (v) of
_Section 11.2(a)_ , with respect to which there shall be no Threshold Amount.
For purposes of this Agreement, except for claims for which there is not a
Threshold Amount, as provided above, any Indemnifiable Damage that is
individually less than the Threshold Amount (an " _Excluded Indemnified Loss_
") shall be ignored for all purposes and treated as if it did not occur.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 11.1_, unless and until one or more Claim Certificates describing
Indemnifiable Damages (disregarding all Excluded Indemnified Losses and Dollar
One Indemnity Items) in an aggregate amount greater than Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the " _Aggregate Threshold_ ") have been
delivered by such Indemnified Person, in which case the Indemnified Person may
make claims for indemnification for all Indemnifiable Damages (including the
Aggregate Threshold but not Excluded Indemnified Losses); _provided, however,_
that the Aggregate Threshold shall not apply with respect to any Indemnifiable
Damages ( _i_ ) arising from, or related to, breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or fraud, or ( _ii_ ) the matters contained in clauses ( _ii_
) through ( _v_ ) of _Section 11.2(a)_ (" _Dollar One Indemnity Items_ "),
for which matters the Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Indemnifiable Damages, subject to the limitations
contained in this Agreement, and which Indemnifiable Damages shall not be
considered in determining whether the Aggregate Threshold has been met since
they are subject to indemnification without regard to the Aggregate Threshold.

(c) If the Merger is consummated, the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons for the indemnity obligations of the Stockholders
under this Agreement shall be recovery from the Escrow Fund, except (i) in the
event of a breach of the Fundamental Representations; (ii) for a claim based
on fraud or (iii) with respect to claims made pursuant to clauses (ii) through
(iv) of _Section 11.2(a)_; _provided, however_ , that, except in the case
of fraud and subject to the Stockholders Agents right to indemnification
from the Stockholders under Section 11.7(b), in no event shall the liability
of any Stockholder hereunder exceed the Merger Consideration actually received
by such Stockholder. An Acquiror Indemnified Person must first look to the
Escrow Fund during the period prior to termination of the Extended Escrow
Period for recovery; provided, however, that if Acquiror recovers an amount
against the Escrow Fund (1) with respect to a breach of the Fundamental
Representations; (2) for a claim based on fraud; or (3) with respect to claims
made pursuant to clauses (ii) through (iv) of Section 11.2(a) (the
"Fundamental Damage Amount") and Acquiror ultimately is entitled to collect
Indemnifiable Damages in excess of the full amount of the Escrow Fund, then
Acquiror may pursue the Stockholders directly for any additional, valid
indemnification claims up to the Fundamental Damage Amount.

 



69 (d) Except to the extent Indemnifiable Damages are actually awarded in a Third
Party Claim or are actually awarded in a Specified IP Claim, no party shall
be liable under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive, special or
indirect damages, or loss of business reputation relating to the breach or
alleged breach of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limitation to the foregoing, no "multiple of cash flow" or "multiple
of EBITDA" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the
amount of any Indemnifiable Damages, except to the extent Indemnifiable
Damages are actually awarded in a Third Party Claim or are actually awarded in
a Specified IP Claim.

(e) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article 11_ , for purposes of computing the amount of any Indemnifiable
Damages incurred by an Indemnified Person under this  _Article 11_ , there
shall be deducted an amount equal to (i) any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Person in respect of such claim, _less_ (ii) any
related costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any
related insurance claims.

11.4 _Period for Claims_.

 

(a) Except as set forth below, the period during which claims for
Indemnifiable Damages may be made (the " _Claims Period_ "), including
against the Escrow Fund for Indemnifiable Damages shall commence at the
Closing and terminate the day after the date that is fifteen (15) months
following the Closing Date (the " _Initial Escrow Period_ "). The Claims
Period for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of _Section 11.2(a)_ _(v)_ shall
commence on the Closing Date and terminate thirty (30) months after the
Closing Date (the " _Extended Escrow Period_ "). The Claims Period for
Indemnifiable Damages (i) arising out of breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or fraud, or (ii) pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ _(iv)_ shall
commence at the Closing and terminate upon the date that is sixty (60)
calendar days beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
No Indemnified Person may make a claim for indemnification after the
expiration of the relevant Claims Period. 

(b) _Escrow Releases_.

(i) Upon the expiration of the Initial Escrow Period, (A) $6,500,000 of the
Escrow Cash; _less_ (B) the amount previously dispersed, _less_ (C) the
amount, as may reasonably be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or
unsatisfied claims made in good faith for Indemnifiable Damages specified in
any Claim Certificate delivered in good faith by an Acquiror Indemnified
Person to the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Claims
Period, shall be promptly delivered (in any event within five (5) Business
Days) to the Stockholders (in the manner set forth below). For the sake of
clarity, if the sum of (B) and (C) exceed $6,500,000, no amount of the Escrow
Fund shall be delivered upon expiration of the Initial Escrow Period.

 



70 (ii) Upon the expiration of the Extended Escrow Period, (A) all remaining
Escrow Cash not previously disbursed; _less_ (B) the amount, as may reasonably
be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable
Damages specified in any Claim Certificate delivered in good faith by an
Acquiror Indemnified Person to the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration
of the Claims Period, shall be promptly delivered (in any event within five
(5) Business Days) to the Stockholders (in the manner set forth below). 

(iii) All releases from the Escrow Fund to be made to the Stockholders shall
be made in accordance with  _Section 4.1(d)_ (as if the amounts distributed
were Net Merger Consideration), unless otherwise directed by the Stockholders
Agent in writing (which instructions may include amounts payable to the
Stockholders Agent directly or on behalf of third parties, in accordance
with _Section 11.7_). None of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall have any liability to any Stockholder for any distribution
to them from the Escrow Fund not in accordance with _Section 4.1(d)_ made
pursuant to the written instructions of the Stockholders Agent.

(iv) For the sake of clarity, it is understood and agreed that, in the event
that there are unresolved Claims that have been properly filed in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement that equal or exceed the targeted release sum,
there will be no distribution to the Stockholders on any such release date,
and the release of such funds shall be made as set forth in the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(c) The availability of the Escrow Fund to indemnify the Acquiror Indemnified
Persons will be determined without regard to any right to indemnification
which any Stockholders may have in his or her capacity as an officer,
director, employee, or agent of the Company and no such Stockholders will be
entitled to any indemnification from the Company or the Surviving Corporation
for amounts paid for indemnification under this _Article 11_. Nothing in this
_Section 11.4(c)_ shall prevent or prohibit a Stockholder from seeking
recovery under any available insurance policy or from enforcing its
rights pursuant to _Section 8.19_.

11.5 _Claims and Procedures_.

 

(a) Prior to the expiration of the relevant Claim Period, Acquiror may deliver
to the Escrow Agent a certificate signed by any officer of Acquiror (a "
_Claim Certificate_ "):

(i) stating that an Acquiror Indemnified Person has a claim for Indemnifiable
Damages;

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the
amount reasonably anticipated by Acquiror to be incurred, paid reserved or
accrued); and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Acquiror) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

 



71 No delay in providing such Claim Certificate within the Claims Period shall
affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Stockholders Agent
or the Stockholders are materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) At the time of delivery of any Claim Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a
duplicate copy of such Claim Certificate shall be delivered to the
Stockholders Agent by or on behalf of Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any
other Acquiror Indemnified Person) in accordance with _Section 12.2_ and for
a period of thirty (30) calendar days after such delivery to the
Stockholders Agent of such Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no
payment pursuant to this _Section 11.5_ unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Stockholders Agent to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30)-calendar day period, the
Escrow Agent shall make delivery of cash from the Escrow Fund to the relevant
Acquiror Indemnified Party in accordance with this _Section 11.5_; 
_provided, however,_ that no such delivery may be made if and to the extent
the Stockholders Agent has objected in a written statement to any claim or
claims made in the Claim Certificate, and such written statement shall have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Acquiror prior to the expiration of
such thirty (30)-calendar day period. In the event that there are no longer
any amounts in the Escrow Fund, and such claim relates to a breach of the
Fundamental Representations, fraud, or _Section 11.2(a)_ _(iv)_ , such Claim
Certificate shall be delivered solely to the Stockholders Agent.

11.6 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

(a) If the Stockholders Agent objects to any claim made by Acquiror in any
Claim Certificate then the Stockholders Agent shall deliver a written notice
(a " _Claim Dispute Notice_ ") to Acquiror during the thirty (30)-day period
commencing upon delivery to the Stockholders Agent of the Claim Certificate.
The Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal
basis for the dispute of any claim made by Acquiror in the Claim Certificate.
If the Stockholders Agent does not deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to
Acquiror prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, then (i) each
claim for indemnification set forth in such Claim Certificate shall be deemed
to have been conclusively determined in Acquirors favor on the terms set
forth in the Claim Certificate, and (ii) if the Escrow Fund remains, then
without any further instructions the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from
the Escrow Fund to Acquiror in an amount equal to the amount of any
Indemnifiable Damages corresponding to such claim or claims as set forth in
such Claim Certificate.

(b) If the Stockholders Agent delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, Acquiror and
the Stockholders Agent shall attempt in good faith for forty-five (45)
calendar days to resolve any objections raised by the Stockholders Agent in
such Claim Dispute Notice. If Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent agree to a
resolution of one or more objections, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum.

(c) If no such resolution can be reached during the forty-five (45)-calendar
day period following Acquirors receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then
upon the expiration of such forty-five (45)-calendar day period, either
Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent may bring suit in accordance with _Section
12.8_ to resolve the matter.

 



72 (d) For purposes of this _Section 11.6_, in any action hereunder in
which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim Certificate is at
issue, Acquiror shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless the
trial court awards Acquiror more than one-half of the amount in dispute, in
which case the Stockholders shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party.
The non-prevailing party shall pay its own expenses and the expenses and the
fees and expenses of the prevailing party, including attorneys fees and
costs, reasonably incurred in connection with such action.

11.7 _Stockholders  Agent_.

(a) Effective at the Closing, Shareholder Representative Services LLC shall
be, and hereby is, appointed by the Stockholders as the agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact for such Stockholders, with full power of substitution and
re-substitution, for all purposes under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
and the Paying Agent Agreement (including full power and authority to act on
the Stockholders behalf). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Stockholders  Agent_" shall mean the agent and attorney-in-fact for and on
behalf of the Stockholders to: (i) execute, as Stockholders Agent, this
Agreement and any agreement or instrument entered into or delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) give and receive
notices, instructions, and communications permitted or required under this
Agreement, or any other agreement, document or instrument entered into
or executed in connection herewith, for and on behalf of any Stockholder, to
or from Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Acquiror Indemnified
Person) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement or any of the transactions and other
matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this
Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall
be given or received by each Stockholder individually); (ii) review,
negotiate and agree to and authorize deliveries to Acquiror of cash from the
Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Acquiror (on behalf of
itself or any other Acquiror Indemnified Person, including by not objecting
to such claims) pursuant to this _Article 11_ ; (iii) object to such claims
pursuant to _Section 11.5_; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into,
or, if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend, settlements and compromises
of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, such claims, resolve any
such claims, take any actions in connection with the resolution of any dispute
relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby by lawsuit,
settlement or otherwise, and take or forego any or all actions permitted or
required of any Stockholder or necessary in the judgment of the Stockholders
Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other
terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement; (v) consult with legal
counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it,
solely at the cost and expense of the Stockholders; (vi) consent or agree to
any amendment to this Agreement or to waive any terms and conditions of this
Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Stockholders (so long as any
such amendment or waiver applies equally to all Stockholders) in accordance
with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein; and (vii) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders Agent
for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek
or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. Acquiror, Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) shall

 



73  be entitled to rely on the appointment of Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as the Stockholders Agent and treat such Stockholders Agent as
the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder and has having the
duties, power and authority provided for in this _Section 11.7_. The
Stockholders shall be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the
Stockholders Agent in connection with this  _Article 11_ , and Acquiror and
other Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely exclusively on
any action or decision of the Stockholders Agent. The Person serving as the
Stockholders Agent may resign at any time and may be replaced from time to
time by a written consent signed by Stockholders holding at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting together
as a single class on an as converted to Common Stock basis) in accordance
with the Contribution and Indemnity Agreement upon not less than ten (10)
calendar days prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of
the Stockholders Agent. All of the immunities and powers granted to the
Stockholders Agent under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The grant of authority
provided for in this _Section 11.7_ is coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
the respective Stockholders and shall be binding on any successor thereto.

(b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any act
done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholders Agent while acting in good
faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholders shall severally (based upon each
Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage) indemnify the Stockholders Agent and hold
it harmless against any loss, liability, damage, claim, penalty, fine,
forfeiture, action, fee, cost or expense arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder (including all
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, the " _Stockholders  Agent Expenses_"), in each case as such
Stockholders Agent Expenses are suffered or incurred; provided, that in the
event that any such Stockholders Agent Expense is finally adjudicated to have
been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholders Agent, the Stockholders Agent will reimburse the Stockholders
the amount of such indemnified Stockholders Agent Expenses attributable to
such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Stockholders Agent by the Stockholders, such Stockholders Agent Expenses may
be recovered by the Stockholders Agent from the Stockholders Agent Expense
Fund and the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Stockholders (and not
distributed or distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to a pending
indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person); provided, that while this
section allows the Stockholders Agent to be paid from the Stockholders
Agent Expense Fund and the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Stockholders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Stockholders Agent Expenses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders Agent
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. No provision of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall require the Stockholders Agent
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement. The
indemnification obligations set forth in this  _Section 11.7_ shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Stockholders Agent and the termination of
this Agreement.

 



74 (c) After the Closing, any notice or communication given or received by, and
any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the
Stockholders Agent that is within the scope of the Stockholders Agents
authority under  _Section 11.7(a)_ shall constitute a notice or
communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of all the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Stockholder; and each Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to rely exclusively upon any such notice, communication, decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice
or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Stockholder. Acquiror, the other Acquiror
Indemnified Persons and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any
Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of
the Stockholders Agent.

(d) The Stockholders Agent Expense Fund shall be available to pay directly
or reimburse the Stockholders Agent for fees, costs and expenses (including
legal fees, costs and expenses) incurred by the Stockholders Agent relating
to the Merger, the transactions contemplated thereby, and post-Closing
matters, whether incurred prior to or after the Closing. The Stockholders will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholders Agent Expense Fund
and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholders Agent any ownership
right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. So
long as the Stockholders Agent Expense Fund is held and maintained in an
FDIC-insured client trust account, the Stockholders Agent will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Stockholders Agent Expense Fund other than
as a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct. For tax purposes, the
Stockholders Agent Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Stockholders at the time of Closing.

(e) To the extent the Stockholders Agent receives documents, spreadsheets or
other forms of information from any party and the Stockholders Agent is
required to deliver any such document, spreadsheet or other form of
information to another party, the Stockholders Agent is not responsible for
the content of such materials, nor is the Stockholders Agent responsible for
confirming the accuracy of any information contained in such materials or
reconciling the content of any such materials with any other documents,
spreadsheets or other information.

(f) Upon the end of the Extended Escrow Period (or such later date as all
related claims or disputes have been resolved), the Stockholders Agent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Stockholders pursuant to
Section 3.1 any portion of the Stockholders Agent Expense Fund which has not
been used to pay the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Stockholders
Agent.

 



75 11.8 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a claim by a third party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), other than a Special IP Claim, which Acquiror in good
faith believes may result in a claim by or on behalf of an Acquiror
Indemnified Person, Acquiror shall promptly notify the Stockholders Agent,
and the Stockholders Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) in
its sole discretion to control and conduct the defense of and to settle or
resolve any such claim (including pre-suit). If the Stockholders Agent elects
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, Acquiror shall have the
right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with
respect to the Third Party Claim (and Stockholders Agent shall promptly
deliver such items to Acquiror) to the extent that receipt of such documents
does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Person and shall be
entitled, at its expense (without a right to be indemnified for such
expenses), to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of
the Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Third
Party Claim. Stockholders Agent shall include the Acquiror in all meetings,
discussions, and negotiations with respect to the Third Party Claim to the
extent that participation in such activities does not affect any privilege
relating to any Indemnified Person. Without limitation to the foregoing,
Stockholders Agent shall regularly consult in good faith and reasonably
consider the opinions of the Acquiror prior to and in connection with
any discussions or settlement negotiations related to a Third Party Claim.
However, except with the consent of the Acquiror, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to
have been given unless the Acquiror shall have objected within fifteen (15)
calendar days after a written request for such consent. Stockholders Agent
shall not settle a Third Party Claim unless it results only in the payment of
money for which Acquiror is indemnified

(b) In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a Specified IP Claim involving the
matter expressly designated as a Special IP Claim set forth on _Schedule
11.2(a_ _)(v)_ to this Agreement (a " _Special IP Claim_ ") which Acquiror in
good faith believes may result in a claim by or on behalf of an Acquiror
Indemnified Person, Acquiror shall promptly notify the Stockholders Agent,
and Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (including pre-suit) and
(provided Acquiror complies with its obligations in this _Section 11.8(b)_
and _Section 11.10_) the reasonable costs and reasonable expenses incurred by
Acquiror in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution (including
reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court
costs) shall be included in the Indemnifiable Damages for which Acquiror may
seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder. The Stockholders
Agent shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to the Special IP Claim (and Acquiror shall
promptly deliver such items to the Stockholders Agent) to the extent that
receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any
Indemnified Person and shall be entitled, at the expense of the Stockholders,
to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of the Special
IP Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Special IP Claim.
Acquiror shall include the Stockholders Agent in all meetings, discussions,
and negotiations with respect to the Special IP Claim to the extent that
participation in such activities does not affect any privilege relating to
any Indemnified Person. Without limitation to the foregoing, Acquiror shall
regularly consult in good faith and reasonably consider the opinions of the
Stockholders Agent prior to and in connection with any discussions or
settlement negotiations related to a Special IP Claim. However, except with
the consent of the Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to
have been given unless the Stockholders Agent shall have objected within
fifteen (15) calendar days after a written request for such consent by
Acquiror, no settlement or resolution by Acquiror of any claim that gives rise
to a claim by or on behalf of 

 



76  an Indemnified Person shall be determinative of the existence of or amount
of Indemnifiable Damages relating to such matter. In the event that the
Stockholders Agent has consented to any such settlement or resolution,
neither the Stockholders Agent nor any Stockholder shall have any power or
authority to object under _Section 11.5_ or any other provision of this
_Article 11_ to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Acquiror Indemnified
Persons refuse to consent to a bona fide, irrevocable offer of settlement of a
Third Party Claim or a Special IP Claim that the Stockholders Agent has
indicated in writing to the Acquiror Indemnified Persons that the
Stockholders accept responsibility for and wish to accept and that (i)
provides for the payment by the Stockholders of money as sole relief for the
claimant, (ii) involves no limitation on the future operations of the
business of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries and (iii) results in the full and
general release of the Acquiror Indemnified Persons from all liabilities
arising or relating to, or in connection with, the Third Party Claim or the
Special IP Claim, and involves no finding or admission of any violation of
Legal Requirements or the rights of any Indemnified Person, the total
liability of the Stockholders for Indemnifiable Damages with regard to such
Third Party Claim or the Special IP Claim shall be equal to the payment of
any reasonable costs and reasonable expenses incurred by the Acquiror
Indemnified Persons in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution
(including reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees
and court costs) until and including the date that the Stockholders Agent has
indicated in writing to the Indemnified Persons that the Stockholders will
accept such settlement offer plus the amount of such settlement offer.

11.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Stockholders and Acquiror
agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to treat) any payment received
pursuant to this _Article 11_ as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for
all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirements.

 

11.10 _Initiation of Settlement Negotiations_. To the extent not inconsistent
with Section 11.8(b), Acquiror shall not (and shall not allow any of its
officers, directors, employees or other agents or representatives to)
approach, or initiate any discussions or settlement negotiations with, any
third party with respect to any Specified IP Claims without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders Agent. Acquiror shall include the
Stockholders Agent in all meetings, discussions and negotiations with respect
to Specified IP Claims and shall regularly consult in good faith and
reasonably consider the opinions of the Stockholders Agent prior to and in
connection with any discussions in or settlement negotiations related to
Specified IP Claims.

12.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto; it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Signatures to this Agreement and/or the related agreements may be
made via electronic signature (.pdf format included). 

12.4 _Entire Agreement; Non-assignability; Parties in Interest_. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all Exhibits,
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and
effect, and shall survive any termination of this

 



79  Agreement, in accordance with its terms, (b) are not intended to confer, and
shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder (except that _Article 11_ is intended
to benefit Indemnified Persons) and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

 

12.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that
Acquiror may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Acquiror without the prior consent of the Company; _provided,
however,_ that Acquiror shall remain liable for all of its obligations under
this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

12.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

12.7 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to
the contrary, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby waive the
requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies
described herein; _provided, however,_ that any Indemnifiable Damages may only
be recovered once by an Indemnified Person.

 

12.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within such State. Each
party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
sitting in the Western District of Michigan in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein and agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each party waives
any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might
be required of any other party with respect thereto. Each party agrees that a
final judgment (after giving effect to any timely appeals) in any action or
proceeding so brought will be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Legal Requirements.

 



80 12.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

12.10 _Acquiror s Due Diligence Investigation_. Acquiror has, for the sole
purpose of determining whether to enter into and negotiate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, conducted a review of information made
available to it regarding the Companys commercial, financial, legal, and
other affairs. The parties agree and acknowledge that the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 5_ (and in the related
portions of the Company Disclosure Letter) shall in no way be limited,
qualified, impaired or affected by Acquirors conduct of such investigation.
Notwithstanding, Acquiror acknowledges that the Company has not made and is
not making, and that Acquiror has not relied upon, any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, the
Merger, or the transactions contemplated hereunder, express or implied, except
as expressly provided in this Agreement.

12.11 _Conflict Waiver_. Notwithstanding that the Company has been represented
by Varnum LLP (the " _Firm_ ") in the preparation, negotiation and execution
of this Agreement, the Company agrees that after the Closing the Firm may
represent the Stockholders Agent, the Stockholders and/or their affiliates in
matters related to this Agreement, including without limitation in respect of
any indemnification claims. The Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of
itself and its affiliates, that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has
obtained information relevant to such representation, including disclosure of
the reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it
hereby waives any conflict arising out of such future representation.

STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT

THIS STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as
of _ _, 2013, between RTI Biologics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Acquiror_ "), and the undersigned stockholder (" _Stockholder_ ") of
Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the " _Company_
").

BACKGROUND

 

A. Acquiror, Rockets MI Corporation, a Michigan corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ "), the Company and certain other
parties have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the
date hereof (as may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Acquiror will acquire the Company through the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such
terms in the Merger Agreement.

B. As a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Acquiror and
Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement, contemporaneously with the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, certain holders of outstanding
capital stock of the Company, including Stockholder, are (i) executing and
delivering a written stockholders consent authorizing and approving the
Companys execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby (the " _Written Consent_ "), and (ii)
entering into stockholder agreements in substantially the form of this
Agreement.

C. Stockholder is the registered and/or beneficial owner of such number of
shares of the Capital Stock as is indicated on _Exhibit A_ hereof (the "
_Shares_ ").

D. Acquiror and Stockholder now wish to enter into this Agreement to (i)
restrict in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof Stockholders
ability to transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares, or any other
shares in the capital of the Company acquired by Stockholder hereafter and
prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in _Section 1(a)_ below), and (ii)
require in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof Stockholder to vote
the Shares and any other such shares in the capital of the Company so as to
facilitate consummation of the Merger. AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt of which the parties hereby acknowledge, Acquiror
and Stockholder agree as follows:

 

Section 1\. Agreement to Retain Shares.

(a) Transfer and Encumbrance. Except as may be specifically required by court
order or by operation of applicable Legal Requirements, Stockholder agrees not
to transfer, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the
Shares or any New Shares (as defined below), or to make any offer or agreement
relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration Date, unless and to the
extent that the purchaser, pledgee or other counterparty in such transaction
executes and delivers a stockholders agreement with Acquiror substantially in
the form of this Agreement. As used herein, the term " _Expiration Date_ "
shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time, or (ii)
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(b) New Shares. Stockholder agrees that any shares in the capital of the
Company that Stockholder purchases or with respect to which Stockholder
otherwise acquires beneficial ownership after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Expiration Date (" _New Shares_ ") shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted
Shares.

Section 2\. Agreement to Vote Shares. The Stockholder shall not revoke,
rescind or otherwise withdraw the its execution and delivery of the Written
Consent. Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of the stockholders
of the Company called with respect to any of the following, and at every
adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written resolution of
the stockholders of the Company with respect to any of the following,
Stockholder shall vote the Shares and any New Shares (i) in favor of approval
of the Merger and (ii) against any proposal for any recapitalization, merger,
sale of assets or other business combination (other than the Merger) between
the Company and any Person other than Acquiror or any other action or
agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger
Agreement in respect of the Merger or which would result in any of the
conditions to the completion of the Merger not being fulfilled.

 

Section 3\. Irrevocable Proxy. Stockholder hereby agrees to timely deliver to
Acquiror a duly executed proxy in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_
(the " _Proxy_ ") with respect to each meeting of stockholders of the Company
after the date of this Agreement, such Proxy to cover the total number of
Shares and New Shares in respect of which Stockholder is entitled to vote at
any such meeting. In the event that Stockholder is unable to provide any such
Proxy in a timely manner, Stockholder hereby grants Acquiror a power of
attorney to execute and deliver such Proxy for and on behalf of Stockholder,
such power of attorney, which being coupled with an interest, shall survive
any death, disability, bankruptcy or any other such impediment. Upon the
execution of this Agreement by Stockholder, Stockholder hereby revokes any and
all prior proxies given by Stockholder with respect to the subject matter of
the Proxy and agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies with respect to the
subject matter of the Proxy until after the Expiration Date.

 



2 Section 4\. No Inconsistent Agreements. Stockholder shall not, in its capacity
as a stockholder of the Company, enter into any agreement or take any other
action that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of its
obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Merger Agreement.

Section 5\. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Stockholder.
Stockholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Acquiror that:

(i) Stockholder has the right, power, authority and capacity to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Proxy and to perform Stockholders obligations
hereunder and thereunder. Subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy and
other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and Legal
Requirements governing specific performance, injunctive relief, and other
equitable remedies: (a) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Stockholder and is enforceable against Stockholder; and (b) the
Proxy, when duly executed and delivered by Stockholder, will be enforceable
against Stockholder. If Stockholder is married and the Shares constitute
community property, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by,
and is enforceable against, Stockholders spouse. 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Proxy by Stockholder
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Stockholder will not: (A)
conflict with or violate any Legal Requirement which may affect the Shares;
(B) result in or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time) in the
creation of any encumbrance or restriction on any of the Shares; or (C)
require any consent or approval of any person, except in the case of clause
(A), (B) or (C) above where any of such events would not have a material
adverse effect on Stockholder or otherwise materially impair Stockholders
ability to satisfy Stockholders obligations hereunder.

(iii) As of the date of this Agreement: (a) Stockholder either (1) holds of
record or (2) beneficially owns with the right to vote (in the case of clause
(1) and (2), free and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter) the number of
outstanding shares of Capital Stock set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereof; and (b)
Stockholder does not directly or indirectly own any shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company or any option, warrant or other right to
acquire (by purchase, conversion or otherwise) any shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company, other than the Shares and Company Options set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (if any). Except to the extent the
Shares are jointly owned or Stockholder is married and the Shares constitute
community property, Stockholder has sole voting power with respect to the
Shares.

(iv) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are
accurate in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and will be
accurate in all material respects at all times through the Expiration Date
(except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific time).

(v) Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Acquiror and Merger Sub are
entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon Stockholders execution
and delivery of this Agreement.

 



3 Section 6\. Further Assurances. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees
to execute and deliver any additional documents, and take such further
actions, necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Acquiror, to
carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

 

Section 7\. Termination. This Agreement and the Proxy delivered in connection
herewith shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the
Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve Stockholder from any liability for any previous
breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 8\. Confidentiality. Stockholder agrees (a) to hold any information
regarding this Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence (other than
information that becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of Stockholder
as a result of being (i) readily ascertainable from public or published
information, or trade sources or (ii) received from a third party not under
an obligation to keep such information confidential), and (b) except as
required by applicable Legal Requirements, not to divulge any such information
to any third person, until such time as the Merger has been
publicly disclosed by Acquiror.

Section 9\. Miscellaneous.

 

(a) Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 

(b) Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned
by either of the parties without the prior written consent of the other. This
Agreement is intended to bind Stockholder as a stockholder of Company only
with respect to the specific matters set forth herein.

 

(c) Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery of a written
agreement executed by the parties hereto.

(d) Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge
that Acquiror will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate
remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of
Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition
to any other remedies that may be available to Acquiror upon any such
violation, Acquiror shall have the right to enforce such covenants and
agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means
available to Acquiror at law or in equity, and Stockholder hereby waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such
enforcement.

(e) Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial
delivery service, or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) or sent via facsimile (with confirmation of receipt) to the
parties.

 



4 (f) Governing Law and Waiver of Jury Trial. All issues and questions
concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of
this Agreement or the Proxy, and all claims and disputes arising hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether purporting to sound
in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Michigan or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Legal Requirements of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Michigan.

(g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Proxy contain the entire
understanding of the parties in respect of the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior negotiations and understandings between the parties with
respect to such subject matter.

(h) Counterpart. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each
of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

(i) Effect of Headings. The section headings herein are for convenience only
and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 | 
   |  |

 On the effective date of this filing, each share of common stock of Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc. (the "Surviving Corporation") issued and outstanding (other than any shares owned by the Surviving Corporation) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, an amount of cash equal (without interest) to the quotient of (a) the net merger consideration payable to common stockholders, divided by (b) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the filing.



 On the effective date of this filing, each share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding (other than shares owned by the Surviving Corporation), as if converted to common stock, shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the net merger consideration payable to preferred stockholders, multiplied by (a) 63.0288%, divided by (b) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the filing.



 

 On the effective date of this filing, each share of Series B Preferred Stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding (other than shares owned by the Surviving Corporation), as if converted to common stock, shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the net merger consideration payable to preferred stockholders, multiplied by (a) 36.9712%, divided by (b) the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the filing.



 

 On the effective date of the filing, all shares of capital stock that are owned by the Surviving Corporation as treasury stock shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and shall no longer constitute equity of any kind of any entity.



 

 Each share of capital stock of Pilgrim Acquisition Corporation (the "Merging Corporation") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the filing shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Form of Escrow Agreement ESCROW AGREEMENT

 

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of  _
_, 2013, by and among RTI Biologics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Acquiror_ "), Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company solely in its capacity as the representative of the
Stockholders (" _Stockholders  Agent_", and together with Acquiror, sometimes
referred to individually as " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_
"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the " _Escrow Agent_ ").

BACKGROUND

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Rockets MI Corporation, a Michigan corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ "), Pioneer Surgical
Technology, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the " _Company_ ") and Stockholders
Agent have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the _
_, 2013 (as may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Acquiror will acquire the Company through the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to
such terms in the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements
to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument
or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any including
without limitation the Merger Agreement.

WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement that Acquiror and Stockholders Agent
enter into this Agreement with Escrow Agent.

 

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Stockholders Agent and Escrow Agent now wish to enter into
this Agreement providing for the appointment of an escrow agent to hold such
escrowed funds and to set forth the terms and conditions under which such
funds held in escrow shall be disbursed.

AGREEMENT

NOW THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

1\. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint Escrow Agent as their escrow agent
for the purposes set forth herein, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

2\. Establishment of Escrow Fund. Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of
$13,000,000 paid to it by wire transfer by Acquiror (the " _Escrow Amount_ ").
The Escrow Agent shall establish on its books and records a segregated
account denominated as, and referred to in this Agreement as, the "
_Indemnification Escrow Fund_ " and shall deposit the Escrow Amount into the
Indemnification Escrow Fund. The Indemnification Escrow Fund and all interest
and income thereon and other proceeds thereof are collectively referred to
herein as the " _Escrow Property_." The Escrow Agent agrees to hold, invest,
release and distribute the Escrow Property and to act as Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement. 3\. Investment of Escrow Property. Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Property
in one or more demand deposit accounts and shall invest and reinvest the
Escrow Property in a JPMorgan Money Market Deposit Account (" _MMDA_ "), or a
successor investment offered by Escrow Agent. MMDA have rates of compensation
that may vary from time to time based as determined by Escrow Agent. The
Parties recognize and agree that instructions to make any other investment ("
_Alternative Investment_ "), must be in a joint writing and executed by
an Authorized Representative (as defined in Section 3 below) of each of the
Parties and shall specify the type and identity of the investments to be
purchased and/or sold. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute
purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own trading
or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow
Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any
Alternative Investment directed hereunder including without limitation
charging any applicable agency fee or trade execution fee in connection with
each transaction. Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations
or advice relating to either the investment of moneys held in the Fund or the
purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described
herein, and Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss in an
investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Market values,
exchange rates and other valuation information (including without limitation,
market value, current value or notional value) of any Alternative Investment
furnished in any report or statement may be obtained from third party sources
and is furnished for the exclusive use of the Parties. Escrow Agent has no
responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value of any
Alternative Investment and makes no representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy of any such valuations or that any values
necessarily reflect the proceeds that may be received on the sale of an
Alternative Investment. Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss
sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its
maturity or for the failure of an Authorized Representative of the Parties to
give Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Property.
Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investments held in order
to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this Agreement. All
interest or other income earned under this Agreement shall be allocated to
Acquiror and reported, by Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing
authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income
earned from the Escrow Deposit by Acquiror whether or not said income has been
distributed during such year. Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems
appropriate in the absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law,
and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. Acquiror hereby
represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that (i) there is no sale or
transfer of an United States Real Property Interest as defined under IRC
Section 897(c) in the underlying transaction giving rise to this Agreement;
and (ii) such underlying transaction does not constitute an installment
sale requiring any tax reporting or withholding of imputed interest or
original issue discount to the IRS or other taxing authority.

 



\- 2 -  4\. Disposition and Termination. Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow
Property in its possession and disburse the Escrow Property or any specified
portion thereof only as follows:

(a) Promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) after the date that
is 15 months following the date hereof (the " _Initial Release Date_ "),
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Agent (defined below) for further
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with written instructions
previously provided by Stockholders Agent to the Escrow Agent on the Initial
Release Date, a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Property equal to
$6,500,000 _less_ (i) the amount of any funds released from the Escrow
Property to the Acquiror prior to the Initial Release Date; _less_ (ii) the
amount as may reasonably be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied
Claims (as defined and the amount, if any, as determined below) specified in
any Claim Notice (as defined below) delivered by Acquiror to the Escrow Agent
and Stockholders Agent prior to the Initial Release Date.

 

(b) Promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) after the date that
is 30 months following the date hereof (the " _Escrow Termination Date_ "),
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Agent for further distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with written instructions previously provided by
Stockholders Agent to Escrow Agent on the Escrow Termination Date (i) all
remaining Escrow Property not previously disbursed; _less_ (ii) the amount as
may reasonably be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied Claims
(as defined and the amount, if any, as determined below) specified in any
Claim Notice (as defined below) delivered by Acquiror to the Escrow Agent and
Stockholders Agent prior to the Escrow Termination Date. This Agreement shall
terminate upon the distribution of all of the Escrow Property from the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms hereof.

(c) If Escrow Agent receives a Claim Notice (as defined below) from Acquiror
prior to the Escrow Termination Date stating that Acquiror is entitled
pursuant to Article XI of the Merger Agreement to be indemnified by the
Stockholders from the Indemnification Escrow Fund (each, a " _Claim_ "), then
Escrow Agent shall disburse or retain Escrow Property in the amount of the
Claim pursuant to _Section 5_.

(d) To the extent that Escrow Property is to be released to the Stockholders
(as defined under the Merger Agreement), Stockholders Agent (and Acquiror, if
applicable) will provide instructions to Escrow Agent to deliver such
disbursement to the Agent (as designated pursuant to that certain Paying Agent
Agreement among Acquiror, Stockholders Agent, the Company, and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. of even date herewith (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ")) for the
benefit of the Stockholders, which Agent will then disburse such monies to the
Stockholders in accordance the Paying Agent Agreement.

5\. Claims Procedure.

(a) If, prior to the Escrow Termination Date, Acquiror determines to assert a
Claim, then Acquiror shall give Escrow Agent and Stockholders Agent written
notice of the Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "), specifying the basis therefor and,
if known or estimable, the amount and calculation thereof and if not known or
estimable, a specific amount determined in good faith (" _Claim Amount_ "). If
Stockholders Agent does not deliver to Acquiror and Escrow Agent written
notice of an objection to Acquirors Claim prior to the 31st calendar day
after receipt of the Claim Notice by Escrow Agent relating thereto, then the
Escrow Agent shall, out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, promptly pay the
Claim Amount to Acquiror, and Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to have
waived any further rights to object thereto. If Stockholders Agent shall
timely (prior to the 31st calendar day after receipt of the Claim Notice by
Escrow Agent) 

 



\- 3 -   deliver to Acquiror and Escrow Agent such written notice of objection, then
Escrow Agent shall not make any payment to Acquiror with respect to such Claim
(or the disputed portion thereof, as specified in Stockholders Agents
written notice of objection) until: (i) it has received joint written
instructions signed by an Authorized Representative of the Acquiror and
Stockholders Agent which refer to such Claim; or (ii) it has received a copy
of a judgment, decree or order of a court, or copy of an arbitration award,
adjudicating the dispute with respect to such Claim, in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement (such order, award or determination must be
accompanied by a written certification from counsel for the instructing Party
attesting that such order, award or determination is final and not subject to
further proceedings or appeal along with a written instruction from
an Authorized Representative of the instructing Party given to effectuate
such order, award or determination, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
conclusively to rely upon any such certification and instruction and shall
have no responsibility to review the order, award or determination to which
such certification and instruction refers or to make any determination as to
whether such order, award or determination is final), whereupon Escrow Agent
shall distribute from the Indemnification Escrow Fund such amount as provided
therein.

(b) If there is a dispute between Acquiror and Stockholders Agent
with regard to the payment of a Claim from the Indemnification Escrow Fund,
the reasonable legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by Escrow Agent
in connection with the adjudication of such dispute shall be paid by the party
which is not the prevailing party in such dispute (as determined in
accordance with the Merger Agreement).

(c) Any amounts held in the Indemnification Escrow Fund after the Escrow
Termination Date in excess of the aggregate Claim Amounts under all Claims
pending as of the Escrow Termination Date, if any, shall be paid promptly to
the Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with
_Section 4_.

(d) Any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in
any way related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Property, must
be in writing or set forth in a Portable Document Format (" _PDF_ "), executed
by the appropriate Party or Parties as evidenced by the signatures of the
person or persons signing this Agreement or one of their designated persons as
set forth in Schedule 1 (each an "Authorized Representative"), and delivered
to Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile or attached to an email on a
Business Day only at the fax number or email address set forth in _Section
10_ below. No instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of
the Escrow Property shall be deemed delivered and effective unless
Escrow Agent actually shall have received it on a Business Day by facsimile
or as a PDF attached to an email only at the fax number or email address set
forth in _Section 10_ and as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the
Partys or Parties transmitting fax number or email address and Escrow Agent
has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required
hereunder. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person for
refraining from acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Escrow Property if delivered to any other fax number or
email address, including but not limited to a valid email address of any
employee of Escrow Agent. Acquiror acknowledges that Escrow Agent is
authorized to use the following funds transfer instructions to disburse any
funds due to Acquiror without a verifying call-back as set forth in _Section
5(d)_ below:

 



\- 4 -  Acquiror:



      |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     |  | Bank Name: |  |  |  | 
   |  | Bank Address: |  |  |  | 
   |  | ABA number: |  |  |  | 
   |  | Account name: |  |  |  | 
   |  | Account number: |  |  |  | 
 

(e) Additionally, Acquiror agrees that repetitive funds transfer instructions
may be given to Escrow Agent for one or more beneficiaries where only the
date of the requested transfer, the amount of funds to be transferred, and/or
the description of the payment shall change within the repetitive instructions
(" _Standing Settlement Instructions_ "). Any such Standing Settlement
Instructions shall be set up in writing in advance of any actual transfer
request and shall contain complete funds transfer information (as set forth
above) for the beneficiary. Any such set-up of Standing Settlement
Instructions (other than those established concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement), and any changes in existing set-up, shall be confirmed by
means of a verifying callback to an Authorized Representative. Standing
Settlement Instructions will continue to be followed until cancelled by
Acquiror in a writing signed by an Authorized Representative and delivered to
Escrow Agent in accordance with this _Section 5(e)_. Once set up as
provided herein, Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such Standing Settlement
Instructions and all identifying information set forth therein for each
beneficiary. Acquiror agrees that any Standing Settlement Instructions shall
be effective as the funds transfer instructions of Acquiror, without
requiring a verifying callback, as set forth in _Section 5(f)_ below, if such
Standing Settlement Instructions are consistent with previously authenticated
Standing Settlement Instructions for that beneficiary.

(f) In the event any other funds transfer instructions are set forth in a
permitted instruction from a Party or the Parties in accordance with _Section
5(d)_, Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such funds transfer
instructions by a single telephone call-back to one of the Authorized
Representatives, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be that Authorized Representative. The persons and telephone
numbers designated for call-backs may be changed only in a writing executed by
Authorized Representatives of the applicable Party and actually received by
Escrow Agent via facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email. Except as set
forth in _Section 5(d)_ above, no funds will be disbursed until an Authorized
Representative is able to confirm such instructions by telephone call-back.
Escrow Agent, any intermediary bank and the beneficiarys bank in any funds
transfer may rely upon the identifying number of the beneficiarys bank or any
intermediary bank included in a funds transfer instruction provided by
a Party or the Parties and confirmed by an Authorized Representative.
Further, the beneficiarys bank in the funds transfer instructions may make
payment on the basis of the account number provided in such Partys or the
Parties instruction and confirmed by an Authorized Representative even
though it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary.

(g) The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption,
transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open
networks such as the Internet, and the Parties hereby agree that the Escrow
Agent is not liable for such risks absent the Escrow Agents gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

 



\- 5 -  (h) The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set forth in this 
_Section 5_ are commercially reasonable.

6\. Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as
are specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any
fiduciary duty, shall be implied. Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any
obligation to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement
between the Parties, nor shall Escrow Agent be required to determine if any
Party has complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any
other agreement between the Parties, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control the actions of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may
conclusively rely upon any written notice, document, instruction or request
delivered by the Parties believed by it, in good faith, to be genuine and to
have been signed by an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable, without
inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind, and Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the
validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or
request. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that Escrow
Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the cause of any direct
loss to either Party. Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform
any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. In the
event Escrow Agent shall be uncertain, or believes there is some ambiguity,
as to its duties or rights hereunder or receives instructions, claims or
demands from any Party hereto which in Escrow Agents judgment conflict with
the provisions of this Agreement, or if Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions from the Parties, Escrow Agent shall be entitled either to: (a)
refrain from taking any action until it shall be given (i) a joint written
direction executed by Authorized Representatives of the Parties which
eliminates such conflict or (ii) court order issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction (it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
conclusively to rely and act upon any such court order and shall have no
obligation to determine whether any such court order is final); or (b) file
an action in interpleader. Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any
payments which may be due it or the Escrow Property, including, without
limitation, the Escrow Amount, nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or
obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts
deposited with it hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for special,
incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits), even if Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of
the form of action.

7\. Resignation; Succession. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from
its duties or obligations hereunder by giving 30 days advance notice in
writing of such resignation to the Parties. Escrow Agents sole responsibility
after such thirty 30 day notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow
Property (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the
same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed by the
Parties, or such other person designated by the Parties, or in accordance with
the directions of a final court order, at which time of delivery, Escrow
Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. If prior to the
effective resignation date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor
escrow agent, or to instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Escrow Property
to another person as provided above, at any time on or after the effective
resignation date, Escrow Agent either (a) may interplead the Escrow Property
with a court located in the State of New York and the reasonable costs,
expenses 

 



\- 6 -   and reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred in connection with such
proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the Escrow Property; or
(b) appoint a successor escrow agent of its own choice. Any appointment of a
successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties, and no appointed
successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of Escrow Agent. Escrow
Agent shall deliver the Escrow Property to any appointed successor escrow
agent, at which time Escrow Agents obligations under this Agreement shall
cease and terminate. Any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or
substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow
Agent under this Agreement without further act.

8\. Compensation. The Parties agree that the Escrow Agents compensation for
the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in
writing shall be as described in _Schedule 2_ , shall be paid by 50% by
Acquiror and 50% by Stockholders Agent (provided, that the Stockholders
Agents portion of such fees may be paid from the Escrow Property. Each of the
Parties further agrees to the disclosures set forth in Schedule 2.

9\. Indemnification and Reimbursement. The Stockholders Agent (solely on
behalf of the Stockholders and in its capacity as the Stockholders Agent,
not in its individual capacity) and Acquiror agree jointly and severally to

of any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or

 Disclosures and Agreements

Patriot Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires Escrow Agent to implement reasonable
procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new account with
it. Accordingly, you acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and
Escrow Agents identity verification procedures require Escrow Agent to
obtain information which may be used to confirm your identity including
without limitation name, address and organizational documents ("identifying
information"). You agree to provide Escrow Agent with and consent to Escrow
Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying information required
as a condition of opening an account with or using any service provided by the
Escrow Agent.

 

OFAC Disclosure. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the laws
and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of money
laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not limited to
regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Escrow Agent
is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other transaction
where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with whom the
Escrow Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or regulation
applicable to Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would, in Escrow
Agents opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or its own
policies and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment order
or effect a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any action
required by any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including,
without limitation, freezing or blocking funds.

Abandoned Property. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property and,
accordingly, shall be entitled to remit dormant funds to any state as
abandoned property in accordance with such laws and regulations.

 

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION
D. WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.

Demand Deposit Account Disclosure. Escrow Agent is authorized, for regulatory
reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow demand deposit
account maintained in the U.S. in which the Fund is held into a non-interest
bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest bearing savings
internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis between these
internal accounts on Escrow Agents general ledger in accordance with U.S. law
at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal accounts and
any transfers between them on Escrow Agents books and records only. The
internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the Fund, any
investment or disposition of the Fund, use of the escrow demand deposit
account or any other activities under this Agreement, except as described
herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for the demand deposit
internal account, which may change at any time. To the extent funds in the
demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the excess will be
transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum number of
transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month or
statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand deposit
internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit internal
account, funds from the savings internal account will be transferred to the
demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance of available funds
in the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and to replenish any
target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the demand deposit
internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a calendar month or
statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the savings internal
account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit internal account for
the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

 

MMDA Disclosure and Agreement. If MMDA is the investment for the escrow
deposit as set forth above or anytime in the future, you acknowledge
and agree that U.S. law limits the number of pre-authorized or automatic

made from an MMDA to a total of six (6) per calendar month or statement cycle
or similar period. Escrow Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve the right
to require at least seven (7) days notice prior to a withdrawal from a money
market deposit account.

Unlawful Internet Gambling. The use of any account to conduct transactions
(including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of funds through an
electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar instrument, or the
proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related, directly or indirectly, to
unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited. _EXHIBIT D _

only violations that can be definitively determined as of the date of this
opinion letter and does not cover violations the occurrence of which is
dependent upon future events or circumstances.

_General Limitations on Opinions_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the opinions expressed above are limited by
the following:

(i) The effect of bankruptcy, reorganization, fraudulent transfer
or conveyance, moratorium, insolvency or other similar laws or court
decisions relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally; [INSERT NAME]

_   _, 2013

Page 5



 

(ii) Equitable principles of general applicability, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law or whether codified by
statute, including, without limitation, the concepts of materiality, laches,
reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and judicial discretion, principles
which may permit a party to cure a failure to perform its obligations, and
principles regarding when injunctive or other equitable remedies will be
available;

 

(iii) Other commonly recognized statutory and judicial constraints on
enforceability, including, without limitation, statutes of limitations;

(iv) The potential to vary the terms of an unambiguous agreement on the basis
of parol evidence; and

 

(v) The potential that certain remedies under the Transaction Agreements may
be unenforceable under or limited by the laws or court decisions of the State
of Michigan.

In addition, we express no opinion as to the applicability to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements of fraudulent
transfer laws and whether such might impact the enforceability of the
Transaction Agreements or any liens or security interests, and understand that
you are relying on your own investigation with respect to those matters.

We specifically express no opinion as to the enforceability of the Transaction
Agreements. Without limitation to the foregoing, we expressly note that the
following types of provisions and agreements may not be enforceable under
Michigan law:

(i) Provisions or agreements providing for a waiver of rights (including,
without limitation, broad, vaguely stated, or future rights), claims, demands,
liabilities, or defenses to obligations, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected;

(ii) Provisions or agreements providing that rights or remedies are or are not
exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in
addition to or with any other right or remedy, or that the election of some
particular remedy or remedies does not preclude recourse to one or another
remedy;

 

(iii) Provisions or agreements involving non-competition, non-solicitation,
non-disclosure, confidentiality, or similar obligations; 

(iv) Provisions or agreements providing for consent to or selection of
jurisdiction or venue, or the waiver of a right to a trial by jury;

(v) Provisions or agreements providing for a party to be indemnified against
its own action or inaction, or its own gross negligence, recklessness, or
willful or unlawful conduct; and [INSERT NAME]

_   _, 2013

Page 6



 

(vi) Provisions or agreements selecting venue, jurisdiction or applicable
law. 

We express no opinion with respect to any federal or state securities (or
"blue sky") laws, rules, or regulations, any laws, rules, and regulations
administered by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any
state securities agency, or any federal or state antitrust or unfair
competition laws or any laws, rules, or regulations, which, in
our experience, are not applicable generally to the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements when undertaken by general business corporations
which are not engaged in regulated activities or businesses.

 

Our advice on every legal issue addressed in this opinion letter is based
exclusively on the internal law of the State of Michigan applicable to the
Company, which, in our experience, are generally applicable to transactions of
this type, is limited to the effect of such law, and specifically excludes the
USA Patriot Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act, Executive Order 13224 and
similar laws and regulations, as well as all laws, rules and regulations of
the type described in Section 19 of the Accord. In addition, we express no
opinion as to any law, rule or regulation (i) the violation of which would
not have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the violation of which can be cured
without significant expense to you, or (iii) to which you may be subject as a
result of your legal or regulatory status.

 

We note that one or more of the Transaction Agreements state that they are to
be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware. We have assumed,
with your approval and without rendering any opinion to such effect, that the
laws of the State of Delaware, in all respects material to any of our
opinions, are identical to the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard
to conflict of law provisions. We express no opinion as to what law might be
applied by any other courts to resolve any issue addressed by our opinion, and
we express no opinion as to whether any relevant difference exists between the
law upon which our opinions are based and any other laws which may actually
be applied to resolve issues which may arise under the Transaction Agreements.

This opinion represents our opinion as to how we believe that issue would be
resolved were it to be considered by the highest court in the State of
Michigan. However, the manner in which any particular issue would be treated
in any actual court case would depend in part on facts and circumstances
particular to the case and would also depend on how the court involved chooses
to exercise the wide discretionary authority generally available to it. This
opinion letter is not intended to guarantee the outcome of any legal dispute
which may arise in the future.

Our opinions are limited to the matters expressly set forth in this opinion
letter, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters
expressly so stated. We are not opining as to the reasonableness or accuracy
of any assumption made for the purposes hereof.

This opinion letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it
bears. We do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent
opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which our Designated Transaction
Lawyers did not have knowledge at that time, by reason of any change
subsequent to that time in any fact or any law, other governmental
requirement, or interpretation thereof covered by any of our opinions or
advice, or for any other reason. [INSERT NAME]

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to RTI Biologics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Acquiror_ "), in connection with the transactions contemplated by that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June __, 2013 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Acquiror, [Rockets MI Corp.], a Michigan
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror, Pioneer Surgical
Technology, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the " _Company_ "), and _
_. The opinions expressed below are furnished to the Company pursuant
to Section 2.3(a)(vi) of the Merger Agreement. Unless otherwise defined
herein, terms defined in the Merger Agreement and used herein shall have the
meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined and relied on the
originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our
satisfaction, of executed copies of the Merger Agreement (including all
Exhibits and Schedules thereto) and all related agreements and other documents
(collectively, the " _Transaction Documents_ ").

 

In addition to the Transaction Documents, we have examined such other
documents and corporate records (collectively, the " _Other Documents_ ") and
questions of law as we deem necessary for the purpose of rendering the
opinions expressed herein. We have also examined such certificates of public
officials, corporate officers of the Acquiror and other Persons as we
have deemed relevant and appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed
herein, and we have made no effort to independently verify the facts set forth
in such certificates. Further, in making the foregoing examinations, we have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of each person
signatory to any of the documents reviewed by us, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. In making the
foregoing examinations, we have assumed that, as to factual matters, all
representations and warranties made in the aforesaid documents were and are
true, correct and complete in all material respects. Moreover, to the extent
that any of the Other Documents are governed by the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the Federal laws of the United States, the Delaware General
Corporation Law or the laws of the State of New York, our opinions relating to
those Other Documents are based solely on the plain meaning of their language
without regard to the interpretation or construction that might be indicated
by the laws governing those Other Documents.

Based upon the foregoing, and upon an examination of such questions of law as
we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions,
exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we advise you
that, in our opinion:

Fulbright and Jaworski LLP is a limited liability partnership registered under
the laws of Texas.

Fulbright and Jaworski LLP, Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, Norton Rose Fulbright
Australia, Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP, Norton Rose Fulbright South
Africa (incorporated as Deneys Reitz, Inc.), each of which is a separate legal
entity, are members of Norton Rose Fulbright Verein, a Swiss Verein. Details
of each entity, with certain regulatory information, are

THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This Letter of Transmittal is being delivered pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
dated  _ _, 2013, by and among RTI Biologics, Inc. ("
_Acquiror_ "), [Pilgrim Acquisition Corporation] (" _Merger Sub_ "), Pioneer
Surgical Technology, Inc. (the " _Company_ ") and Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, as stockholders agent (the " _Stockholders 
Agent_"), pursuant to which Acquiror will acquire the Company through the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, the undersigned surrenders herewith the above
certificate(s) representing shares of capital stock (the " _Shares_ ") of the
Company in exchange for the merger consideration (" _Merger Consideration_ ")
that is payable to undersigned pursuant to the Merger Agreement. No payment
shall be made with respect to any shares of Company capital stock represented
by a Certificate(s) until the surrender of such Certificate(s) for exchange.

By executing and delivering this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned hereby
represents and warrants that (1) the undersigned is the registered holder of
the shares of Company capital stock surrendered herewith and has good and
valid title thereto and has full right, power and authority to deliver,
surrender, sell, assign and transfer such shares of capital stock as provided
herein free and clear of all mortgages, liens, restrictions (including voting
and transfer restrictions), charges, encumbrances, security interests and
adverse claims, except for restrictions under the applicable securities laws
and, if applicable, that certain Stockholders Agreement entered into
in connection with the Merger; (2) this Letter of Transmittal is duly and
validly executed and delivered by the undersigned and constitutes the valid
and binding agreement of the undersigned enforceable against the undersigned
in accordance with its terms; (3) the execution of this Letter of Transmittal
and the delivery of the above-referenced shares of capital stock do not
require, on behalf of the undersigned, any filing with, notice to, or permit,

governmental or regulatory body or the approval or consent of any other
person; (4) other than the shares of capital stock surrendered herewith, the
undersigned owns no shares of Company capital stock; and (5) the undersigned
acknowledges, agrees and understands that, pursuant to the terms of the Merger

By executing and delivering this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned

Consideration that would be payable to the Stockholders under the Merger
Agreement, less the portions of the aggregate consideration that would be
payable to the Stockholders under the Merger Agreement which may be placed
into the escrow as described above, will not be deemed to have occurred
unless and until the Paying Agent has received the Certificates and this
Letter of Transmittal, as properly completed and duly executed, together with
all accompanying evidence of authority in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Paying Agent; (2) delivery of such Certificates will be
effected and risk of loss and title to such Certificates will pass only upon
proper surrender thereof to the Paying Agent; and (3) all questions as to the
validity, form and eligibility of this Letter of Transmittal, any other
documentation delivered herewith or pursuant hereto, and any purported
surrender of Certificates hereunder will be determined in good faith by the
Paying Agent, following consultation with Acquiror and Stockholders Agent. By executing and delivering this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned
acknowledges that as a result of the approval of the Merger Agreement by the
holders of Company capital stock, the undersigned is deemed to have
irrevocably appointed Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as
Stockholders Agent, to take any actions as the designated representative,
agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned under the Merger Agreement and
any other agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including,
without limitation, the full authority to make all decisions and
determinations and to take all actions required or permitted under or relating
to the Escrow Agreement and Section 4.9 and Article XI of the Merger Agreement
on behalf of the undersigned).

By executing and delivering this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned hereby
expressly acknowledges and agrees with Acquiror and, from and after the
effective time of the Merger, the Company, that, by executing and delivering
this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned will be subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement as a "Stockholder" thereunder and that the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, including without limitation, Section 4.9
and the indemnification and other obligations set forth in Articles XI of the
Merger Agreement, shall be binding on the undersigned holder of shares
of Company capital stock and its successors-in-interest to the same extent as
if the undersigned were a party to the Merger Agreement.

By executing and delivering this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned
holder of shares of Company capital stock hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally: (1) consents in writing to and approves for all purposes the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the provisions thereof and agrees to be bound by the terms of
the Merger Agreement; and (2) waives any and all rights to any notice that may
be required in connection with the Merger, whether pursuant to the Companys
Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, any agreement to which the Company and the

General Instructions

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.

Purpose of Form

 

A person who is required to file an information return with the IRS must
obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) to report, for
example, income paid to you, real estate transactions, mortgage interest you
paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, or
contributions you made to an IRA.

Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to
provide your correct TIN to the person requesting it (the requester) and, when
applicable, to:

 

1\. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a
number to be issued),

 

2\. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or

3\. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If
applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable
share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject
to the withholding tax on foreign partners share of effectively connected
income.

 

  

 

Note. If a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN,
you must use the requesters form if it is substantially similar to this Form
W-9.

Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a
U.S. person if you are:

 An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien,

 

 A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in
the United States or under the laws of the United States,

 An estate (other than a foreign estate), or

 

 A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).

Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business
in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax on any
foreign partners share of income from such business. Further, in certain
cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, a partnership is required to
presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the withholding tax.
Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership
conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the
partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid withholding on your share
of partnership income.

The person who gives Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing
its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income
from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States is in
the following cases:



    | The U.S. owner of a disregarded entity and not the entity, 
---|--- 



     |  |  |

The U.S. grantor or other owner of a grantor trust and not the trust, and 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

The U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the
trust. 

---|---|---|--- 
 

Foreign person. If you are a foreign person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-8 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax
on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).

Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.

 

Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax
treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However,
most tax treaties contain a provision known as a "saving clause." Exceptions
specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue
for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S.
resident alien for tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in
the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on
certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that
specifies the following five items:

1\. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which
you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.

2\. The treaty article addressing the income.

3\. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the
saving clause and its exceptions.

4\. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax. 

5\. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the
treaty article.

 

 _Example._ Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an __
exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student
temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will
become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United
States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol
to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of
Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a
resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this
exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this
exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or
fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the
information described above to support that exemption. 

If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject to backup
withholding, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8.

What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under
certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS a percentage of such payments.
This is called "backup withholding." Payments that may be subject to backup
withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and
barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, and certain
payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject
to backup withholding.

You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you
give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and
report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.

 

Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:

1\. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,

2\. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions
on page 3 for details),

3\. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,

 

4\. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you
did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return
(for reportable interest and dividends only), or

5\. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup
withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts
opened after 1983 only). 

 

Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See the
instructions below and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form
W-9.

Also see _Special rules for partnerships_ on page 1.

 

Updating Your Information

You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be
an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need
to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be
an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must
furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account, for
example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.

 

Penalties

Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a
requester, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless
your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a
false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup
withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty. 

Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.

Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of
federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

Specific Instructions

Name

If you are an individual, you must generally enter the name shown on your
income tax return. However, if you have changed your last name, for instance,
due to marriage without informing the Social Security Administration of the
name change, enter your first name, the last name shown on your social
security card, and your new last name.

 

If the account is in joint names, list first, and then circle, the name of the
person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of the form. 

Sole proprietor. Enter your individual name as shown on your income tax return
on the "Name" line. You may enter your business, trade, or "doing business as
(DBA)" name on the "Business name/disregarded entity name" line.

Partnership, C Corporation, or S Corporation. Enter the entitys name on the
"Name" line and any business, trade, or "doing business as (DBA) name" on the
"Business name/disregarded entity name" line.

 

Disregarded entity. Enter the owners name on the "Name" line. The name of the
entity entered on the "Name" line should never be a disregarded entity. The
name on the "Name" line must be the name shown on the income tax return on
which the income will be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is
treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a domestic
owner, the domestic owners name is required to be provided on the "Name"
line. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter
the first owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the
disregarded entitys name on the "Business name/disregarded entity name" line.
If the owner of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, you must complete
an appropriate Form W-8.

 

Note. Check the appropriate box for the federal tax classification of the
person whose name is entered on the "Name" line (Individual/sole proprietor,
Partnership, C Corporation, S Corporation, Trust/estate).

Limited Liability Company (LLC). If the person identified on the "Name" line
is an LLC, check the "Limited liability company" box only and enter the
appropriate code for the tax classification in the space provided. If you are
an LLC that is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes, enter "P"
for partnership. If you are an LLC that has filed a Form 8832 or a Form 2553
to be taxed as a corporation, enter "C" for C corporation or "S" for S
corporation. If you are an LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from
its owner under Regulation section 301.7701-3 (except for employment and
excise tax), do not check the LLC box unless the owner of the LLC (required to
be identified on the "Name" line) is another LLC that is not disregarded for
federal tax purposes. If the LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its
owner, enter the appropriate tax classification of the owner identified on the
"Name" line.

Other entities. Enter your business name as shown on required federal tax
documents on the "Name" line. This name should match the name shown on the
charter or other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any
business, trade, or DBA name on the "Business name/ disregarded entity name"
line.

 

Exempt Payee

If you are exempt from backup withholding, enter your name as described above
and check the appropriate box for your status, then check the "Exempt payee"
box in the line following the "Business name/ disregarded entity name," sign
and date the form.

 

Generally, individuals (including sole proprietors) are not exempt from backup
withholding. Corporations are exempt from backup withholding for certain
payments, such as interest and dividends.

Note: If you are exempt from backup withholding, you should still complete
this form to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding.

The following payees are exempt from backup withholding:

 

1\. An organization exempt from tax under section 501(a), any IRA, or a
custodial account under section 403(b)(7) if the account satisfies
the requirements of section 401(f)(2),

2\. The United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities,

 

3\. A state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, or
any of their political subdivisions or instrumentalities,

 

4\. A foreign government or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or
instrumentalities, or

 

5\. An international organization or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.

 

Other payees that may be exempt from backup withholding include:

6\. A corporation,

7\. A foreign central bank of issue,

 

8\. A dealer in securities or commodities required to register in the United
States, the District of Columbia, or a possession of the United States, 

9\. A futures commission merchant registered with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission,

 

10\. A real estate investment trust,

 

11\. An entity registered at all times during the tax year under the
Investment Company Act of 1940,

 

12\. A common trust fund operated by a bank under section 584(a),

13\. A financial institution,

14\. A middleman known in the investment community as a nominee or custodian,
or

15\. 6. A trust exempt from tax under section 664 or described in section
4947.

 

The following chart shows types of payments that may be exempt from backup
withholding. The chart applies to the exempt payees listed above, 1 through
15.

However, the following payments made to a corporation and reportable on Form
1099-MISC are not exempt from backup withholding: medical and health care
payments, attorneys fees, gross proceeds paid to an attorney, and payments
for services paid by a federal executive agency.  

---|--- 

 

Part I. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)

Enter your TIN in the appropriate box. If you are a resident alien and you do
not have and are not eligible to get an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual
taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Enter it in the social security number
box. If you do not have an ITIN, see _How to get a TIN_ below.

If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your
SSN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN.

If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from
its owner (see _Limited Liability Company (LLC)_ on page 2), enter the owners
SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the disregarded entitys EIN.
If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entitys
EIN.

Note: See the chart on page 4 for further clarification of name and
TIN combinations.

How to get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To
apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from
your local Social Security Administration office or get this form online at
_www.ssa.gov_. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form
W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply
for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to
apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website
at _www.irs.gov/businesses_ and clicking on Employer Identification Number
(EIN) under Starting a Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS
by visiting IRS.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).

If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, write "Applied
For" in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the
requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with
respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to
get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup
withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types
of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments
until you provide your TIN to the requester.

Note: Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or
that you intend to apply for one soon.

__Caution: _A disregarded domestic entity that has a foreign owner must_ _use
the appropriate Form W-8._

Part II. Certification

 

To establish to the withholding agent that you are a U.S. person, or resident
alien, sign Form W-9. You may be requested to sign by the withholding agent
even if item 1, below, and items 4 and 5 on page 4 indicate otherwise.

For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in Part I should sign
(when required). In the case of a disregarded entity, the person identified on
the "Name" line must sign. Exempt payees, see _Exempt Payee_ on page 3.

Signature requirements. Complete the certification as indicated in items 1
through 3, below, and items 4 and 5 on page 4.

1\. Interest, dividend, and barter exchange accounts opened before 1984 and
broker accounts considered active during 1983. You must give your correct TIN,
but you do not have to sign the certification. 

2\. Interest, dividend, broker, and barter exchange accounts opened after 1983
and broker accounts considered inactive during 1983. You must sign the
certification or backup withholding will apply. If you are subject to backup
withholding and you are merely providing your correct TIN to the requester,
you must cross out item 2 in the certification before signing the form.

3\. Real estate transactions. You must sign the certification. You may cross
out item 2 of the certification.

4\. Other payments. You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to
sign the certification unless you have been notified that you have previously
given an incorrect TIN. "Other payments" include payments made in the course
of the requesters trade or business for rents, royalties, goods (other than
bills for merchandise), medical and health care services (including payments
to corporations), payments to a nonemployee for services, payments to certain
fishing boat crew members and fishermen, and gross proceeds paid to attorneys
(including payments to corporations).

5\. Mortgage interest paid by you, acquisition or abandonment of secured
property, cancellation of debt, qualified tuition program payments (under
section 529), IRA, Coverdell ESA, Archer MSA or HSA contributions or
distributions, and pension distributions. You must give your correct TIN, but
you do not have to sign the certification.

Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft

Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your
name, social security number (SSN), or other identifying information, without
your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use
your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a
refund.

To reduce your risk: 

 

 Protect your SSN,

holder must cross out item (2) in Part 2 of Form W-9 if such holder is

2 IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

 

Under United States federal income tax laws, a holder who receives cash
payments pursuant to the Merger is required to provide the Paying Agent (as
payer) with such holders correct TIN on the Form W-9 above (or otherwise
establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify under
penalty of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such holder is
not subject to backup withholding. If such holder is an individual, the TIN
is his or her social security number. If the Paying Agent is not provided with
the correct TIN, a $50 penalty may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Service,
and the payment of any cash pursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup
withholding.

Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and foreign
individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt holders should indicate their exempt status on
Form W-9. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt recipient,
such individual must submit a Form W-8 BEN, signed under penalties of
perjury, attesting to such individuals exempt status. A Form W-8 BEN can be
obtained from the Paying Agent or at the link below. Please note that there
are additional Form W-8s if the W-8BEN does not apply to your particular
situation. The additional forms can be accessed at the following IRS links:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8imy.pdf

 

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8exp.pdf

 |  | 
 

If backup withholding applies, the Paying Agent is required to withhold at a
rate not to exceed 28% of any payments made to the holder or other payee.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the Federal income tax
liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld provided that the required information is given to the
IRS. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.

Purpose of Form W-9

To prevent backup withholding on payments made with respect to
Certificate(s), the holder is required to notify the Paying Agent of such
holders correct TIN by completing the form above, certifying that (1) the TIN
provided on the Form W-9 is correct (or that such holder is awaiting a TIN),
(2) such holder is not subject to backup withholding because (a) such holder
is exempt from backup withholding, (b) such holder has not been notified by
the Internal Revenue Service that he is subject to backup withholding as
a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends or (c) the Internal
Revenue Service has notified such holder that such holder is no longer subject
to backup withholding and (3) such holder is a U.S. person (including a
U.S. resident alien).

 



3 What Number to Give the Paying Agent

 

The holder is required to give the Paying Agent the TIN (i.e., social security
number or employer identification number) of the holder of the Certificate(s)
tendered hereby. If the Certificate(s) are held in more than one name or are
not held in the name of the actual owner, consult the instructions following
the Form W-9 for additional guidance on which number to report.

Form of Paying Agent Agreement PAYING AGENT AGREEMENT

 

This PAYING AGENT AGREEMENT (as the same may be amended or modified from time
to time pursuant hereto, this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
_ _, 2013 by and among RTI Biologics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Acquiror_ "), Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the
"Company"), Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company solely in its capacity as the representative of the
Stockholders (" _Stockholders  Agent_") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association (the " _Agent_ "). Each of Acquiror, Stockholders Agent and the
Company are sometimes referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Rockets MI Corporation, a Michigan corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ "), the Company and
Stockholders Agent have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of the  _ _, 2013 (as may be amended from time to time, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Acquiror will acquire the Company
through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides that at the time of acceptance of the
Certificate of Merger by the State of Michigan (the " _Effective Time_ "),
each share of Company common and preferred stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted
automatically into the right to receive a certain amount of cash, without
interest, as set forth in the Merger Agreement (the " _Merger Consideration_
");

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides for the appointment by the Parties of a
paying agent in connection with the disbursement of the Merger Consideration;
and

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the representations,
warranties and mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

1\. Appointment. The Parties hereby appoint hereby appoint the Agent to serve
as paying agent in connection with the disbursement of the Merger
Consideration. Agent hereby accepts such appointment pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

2\. Effective Time. Acquiror will notify the Agent of the actual Effective
Time on the date thereof, in writing or set forth in a Portable Document
Format (" _PDF_ "), executed by an Authorized Representative and delivered to
Agent only by confirmed facsimile or attached to an email on a Business Day
only at the fax number or email address set forth in  _Section 19_ below.

3\. Deposit into Payment Account. At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
deposit with the Agent, for the benefit of the record holders of certificates
representing the Company common and preferred stock (the " _Company Holders_
") cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Agent will hold the
Merger Consideration uninvested in one or more demand deposit accounts (the "
_Payment Account_ ") and disburse such funds in accordance with _Section
6_ hereof. 4\. Holders List. Acquiror will furnish to Agent an electronic spreadsheet
or list as of the Effective Time of the Company Holders in a form reasonably
acceptable to Agent (the " _Holders List_ "). The Holders List will be
delivered to the following Agents email addresses: (i)
ops.final.flat.file@jpmchase.com; and (ii) ec.escrow@jpmorgan.com. The Holders
List will include the name and addresses of each of the Company Holders, their
respective tax identification number, tax identification type, whether
the tax identification number is certified, number of shares owned,
certificate prefix, certificate number(s) and amount due to each Company
Holder as well as all available information to enable the Agent to complete
required cost basis tax reporting. Cost basis information may include date of
acquisition, cost basis, reported gain or loss, and covered/non-covered
status. If cost basis information is not provided within 15 days of the
Effective Time, the Agent is required by IRS rules to make one further
request for the information. If Agent does not receive cost basis information
in response to this request, the IRS Form 1099-B referred to in Section 16
will reflect a non-covered status. The Holders List shall either be attached
hereto as _Schedule 2_ , or if provided by Acquiror after the date of this
Agreement, accompanied by a certification in substantially the form attached
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Acquiror Certification_ ") and executed by
an Authorized Representative.

5\. Letter of Transmittal. Within five Business Days following the later
of (a) the Effective Time; or (b) the receipt of the Holders List by Agent,
Agent will cause to be mailed to each Company Holder a letter of transmittal
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), in substantially the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit B_ instructing such Company Holder of the procedure for returning
the Letter of Transmittal and the stock certificates of such Company Holder
(the " _Certificates_ ") to Agent.

 

6\. Disbursements from Payment Account.

(a) Upon receipt and acceptance by Agent of (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii)
notification from Acquiror of the actual Effective Time, (iii) the Letter of
Transmittal and a Form W-9 or W-8 (as applicable) (or its successor form)
signed and completed by any Company Holder, and (iv) the Certificate(s) held
by such Company Holder as reflected on the Holders List (or a properly
executed affidavit and indemnification concerning lost certificates), Agent
shall take the following actions (in the order as shown):

(i) physically cancel each Certificate which is accepted by Agent for a
corresponding disbursement pursuant to clause (b) below provided such canceled
Certificate(s) shall be returned to Acquiror upon termination of this
Agreement; and

 

(ii) within three Business Days, disburse from the Payment Account to the
account of such Company Holder an amount equal to the amount to be paid to
such person pursuant to Holders List (collectively, the " _Closing Payments_
"). Agent shall disburse such amount by check or authorized wire transfer, as
applicable.

 



\- 2 -  (b) Promptly following the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date as may be agreed to by the parties hereto), Agent shall
deliver to Acquiror any funds in the Payment Account that remain undistributed
to any Company Holder pursuant to Acquirors funds transfer instructions as
set forth in  _Section 20_ below, unless required otherwise by applicable
law, to be held by Acquiror in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

(c) Any Company Holder who has not theretofore complied with the provisions of
this _Section 6_ and _Sections 7_ , _8_ and _9_ hereof shall thereafter look
only to Acquiror or appropriate governmental entity or public official for
payment of such Company Holders share of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding any instruction to the contrary, Agent shall comply with all
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law, and Agent shall not be
liable to Acquiror nor any Company Holder for any cash from the Payment
Account delivered to the Acquiror or a governmental entity or public official
in respect of any such Company Holders Company capital stock pursuant to
this Agreement or any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(d) From time to time after the Effective Time, Stockholders Agent may
notify Agent and Acquiror that there are additional funds that are to be
disbursed to the Company Holders as further Merger Consideration. If so
notified, then Stockholders Agent and Acquiror will deliver to Agent an
updated Holders List, and upon receipt of the additional Merger Consideration,
Agent shall disburse such funds in accordance with the updated Holders List
and the previous payment instructions received from the Company Holders in
their respective Letters of Transmittal, except as otherwise indicated in any
update delivered to Agent by the Stockholders Agent to reflect any
assignments or other changes in factual information. With respect to such
additional payments, the Agent shall rely upon all tax forms used and
collected by the Agent in connection with the Closing Payments. If any funds
are returned as undeliverable, then Agent shall deliver any such funds to
Acquiror pursuant to Acquirors funds transfer instructions as set forth in
_Section 20_ below, unless required otherwise by applicable law, to be held
by Acquiror in accordance with the Merger Agreement. When Stockholders Agent
delivers a notification to Agent and Acquiror that there are no additional
funds to be disbursed, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon
receipt of such notice.

7\. Examination of Documents Received. Agent will examine each Letter of
Transmittal, Certificate and other supporting documents received to ascertain
whether they appear to have been completed and executed reasonably in
accordance with the instructions set forth in the Letter of Transmittal and
other applicable requirements. In the event that Agent determines that any
Letter of Transmittal does not appear to have been properly completed
or executed, or that a Certificate does not appear to be in proper form for
surrender, or any other irregularity in connection with the surrender appears
to exist, Agent shall be entitled to consult with an Authorized Representative
of Acquiror for instructions. Company Holders entitled to payment in excess
of $500,000 (as per the Holders List), may be contacted directly by Agent and
requested to provide any missing or incomplete information or documentation.
Agent reserves the right to reject all other such incomplete or irregular
presentations. In particular, but without limitation, if there are any
discrepancies between the number of shares of Company common

 



\- 3 -   or preferred stock that any Letter of Transmittal, Certificate or other
supporting document may indicate are owned by a Company Holder and the number
of shares of Company common or preferred stock that the Holders List
indicates such Company Holder owned of record, Agent shall consult with an
Authorized Representative of the Acquiror for instructions as to the number of
shares of Company common or preferred stock, if any, it is authorized to
accept for payment; and in the absence of such instructions, Agent is not
authorized to make payment and shall, except as thereafter directed in writing
by an Authorized Representative or as required pursuant to _Section
6_ hereof, continue to hold any Certificate(s) surrendered in connection
therewith, the related Letter of Transmittal and any other supporting
documents received with such Certificate(s).

 

8\. Payment to Other than Registered Company Holders. If payment is to be made
by Agent to a person other than the registered holder of a surrendered stock
Certificate(s), Agent will make no payment until the Certificate(s) so
surrendered has been endorsed properly, or is otherwise in proper form for or
any portion thereof to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate(s) surrendered.

9\. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. With respect to any Company Holder
who reports that the failure to surrender a Certificate(s) is due to the
theft, loss or destruction thereof, upon receipt of an affidavit of such
theft, loss or destruction in form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ by Agent
and, unless otherwise instructed by an Authorized Representative of the
Acquiror in writing, the Agent may effect payment to such Company Holder as
though the Certificate(s) had been surrendered. Agent shall be held harmless
and indemnified by the Company from any and all liability with respect to any
payment made to any Company Holder on the basis of any such affidavit without
presentation of a Certificate.

10\. Recordkeeping. As of the Effective Time and until the disbursement of the
remaining funds in the Payment Account to Acquiror pursuant to Section 6
hereof (including any future funds to be deposited pursuant to Section 6(d)),
Agent will serve as the sole paying agent. Agent shall furnish until otherwise
notified monthly reports to Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent showing the
number of Certificates surrendered and payments made in respect thereto.
Promptly following the date on which this Agreement terminates, Agent shall
furnish to Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent a list of Company Holders who
shall have provided Agent with the documentation required by this Agreement.

11\. Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may terminate by the written
agreement of Parties hereto and shall terminate automatically in accordance
with _Section 6(d)_. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the duties of
Agent under this Agreement shall terminate, subject to the provisions of
_Section 15_ below.

12\. Agent. Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and
expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary duty,
shall be implied. Agent has no knowledge of, nor any obligation to comply
with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement between the Acquiror
and other parties, including, but not limited to the Merger Agreement, nor
shall Agent be required to determine if any Acquiror or any other party has
complied with any other agreement. Notwithstanding the terms of any
other agreement between the Acquiror and any other parties, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall control the actions of Agent. Agent may
conclusively rely upon any

 



\- 4 -   written notice, document, instruction or request delivered by any Party
believed by it, in good faith, to be genuine and to have been signed by an
Authorized Representative without inquiry and without requiring
substantiating evidence of any kind, and Agent shall be under no duty to
inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such
document, notice, instruction or request. Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to
the extent that Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the cause
of any direct loss to any Party. Agent may execute any of its powers and
perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents.
In the event Agent shall be uncertain, or believes there is some ambiguity, as
to its duties or rights hereunder or receives instructions, claims or demands
from any person which in Agents judgment conflict with the provisions of
this Agreement, Agent shall be entitled either to: (a) refrain from taking any
action until it shall be given (i) a written direction executed by an
Authorized Representative which eliminates such conflict or (ii) a court
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (it being understood that
the Agent shall be entitled conclusively to rely and act upon any such court
order and shall have no obligation to determine whether any such court order
is final); or (b) file an action in interpleader. Agent shall have no duty to
solicit any payments which may be due it or the Payment Account, including,
without limitation, the Merger Consideration, nor shall Agent have any duty
or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts
deposited with it hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall Agent be liable for special, incidental,
punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if Agent has been advised of
the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 

13\. Resignation and Removal of Agent.

(a) Agent may resign from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time
by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Parties or may be
removed, with or without cause, by the Parties at any time by giving thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Agent executed by an Authorized
Representative of each Party. Such resignation or removal shall take effect
upon the appointment of a successor agent by the Parties. If prior to the
effective resignation date, the Parties have failed to appoint a successor
paying agent or an Authorized Representative to instruct Agent to deliver the
funds in the Payment Account to another person as provided above, at any time
on or after the effective resignation date, Agent either (i) may interplead
the funds on deposit in the Payment Account with a court located in the State
of New York and the reasonable costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys fees
which are incurred in connection with such proceeding may be charged against
and withdrawn from the Payment Account; or (ii) appoint a successor agent of
its own choice. Any appointment of a successor agent shall be binding upon the
Parties, and no appointed successor agent shall be deemed to be an agent of
Agent. Upon the acceptance in writing of any appointment as successor agent,
such successor agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement
and this Agreement shall terminate subject to the provisions of _Section 15_
below.

 

(b) Any entity into which Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all of the
Agents escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Agent under this
Agreement without further act.

 



\- 5 -  14\. Compensation and Reimbursement. Acquiror shall pay Agent upon execution

for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in
writing, shall be as described in _Schedule 2_. Acquiror further agrees to the
disclosures set forth in _Schedule 2_.

15\. Indemnity. The Stockholders Agent (solely on behalf of the Stockholders
and in its capacity as the Stockholders Agent, not in its individual

harmless, pay or reimburse Agent and its affiliates and their respective
successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ")
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties,
judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of outside
counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) (collectively " _Losses_ "), arising out of or in
connection with (a) Agents performance of this Agreement, except to the
extent that such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have been caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith of
such Indemnitee; and (b) Agents following any instructions or directions
from the Parties or an Authorized Representative of the Parties received in
accordance with this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant Agent a lien on,
right of set-off against and security interest in the Payment Account for the
payment of any claim for indemnification, fees, expenses and amounts due to
Agent or an Indemnitee. Subject to providing the Parties a written notice 30
calendar days prior to withdrawing any funds from the Payment Account, Agent
is expressly authorized and directed, but shall not be obligated, to charge
against and withdraw from the Payment Account for its own account or for the
account of an Indemnitee any amounts due to Agent or to an Indemnitee
under Section 14 or 15. The obligations set forth in this Section 15 shall
survive the resignation, replacement or removal of Agent or the termination of
this Agreement.

16\. Taxpayer Identification/Tax Reporting.

(a) On or before the date required by applicable law, Agent will prepare and
mail to each Company Holder other than a Company Holder who demonstrates its
status as a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or
nonresident alien (a " _Foreign Person_ "), in accordance with applicable tax
law an IRS Form 1099-B or other applicable form reporting the aggregate amount
received by such Company Holder and any applicable cost basis information,
including but not limited to, date of acquisition, cost basis, reported gain
or loss, and covered/non-covered status, in accordance with applicable tax
law. Agent will also prepare and file copies of such IRS Forms 1099-B or such
other applicable form with the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable
taxing authority on or before the date required, in accordance with applicable
tax law. Acquiror hereby represents and warrants to Agent that there is no
sale or transfer of a United States Real Property Interest as defined in IRC
Section 897(c) in the merger giving rise to this Agreement.

 



\- 6 -  (b) If the Agent has not received from any Company Holder (i) a duly completed
and executed IRS Form W-9 (or its successor form) in the case that such
Company Holder is not a Foreign Person or (ii) an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or
its successor form), duly completed and executed, in the case that such
Company Holder is a Foreign Person, then the Agent shall deduct and withhold
any taxes it deems appropriate from any payment made to such Company Holder as
required by law, and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

there shall exist any dispute with respect to the holding or disposition of
any of the funds in the Payment Account or any other obligations of Agent
under this Agreement, or if a legal garnishment, attachment, levy, restraining
notice or court order is served with respect to any funds in the Payment
Account, or the disbursement of any funds in the Payment Account shall be
stayed or enjoined by any similar order of a court, or Agent is unable to
determine, to Agents sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of any funds
in the Payment Account, or if the Parties have not, within thirty (30) days
of the furnishing by the Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to Section
13 hereof, appointed a successor agent to act under this Agreement, then Agent
may, in its sole discretion, may take any or all of the following actions:

(a) obey and comply with all writs, orders, judgments or decrees so entered
or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding
upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that Agent
obeys or complies with any such writ, order, judgment or decree it shall
not be liable to the Parties, any Company Holder or any other person, entity,
firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ,
order, judgment or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated; 

(b) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement
until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction
of Agent or until a successor agent shall have been appointed, as the case may
be; and/or

 

(c) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction in New York or instructions with
respect to such dispute or uncertainty, and pay into such court all funds held
by it in the Payment Account for holding and disposition in accordance with
the instructions of such court.

 

(d) Agent shall have no liability to the Parties, any Company Holder or any
other person, entity, firm or corporation with respect to any suspension of
performance or disbursement into court, specifically including any liability
or claimed liability that may arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of or
as a result of any delay in the disbursement of funds held in the Payment
Account or any delay in or with respect to any other action required or
requested of Agent.

20\. Security Procedures. 

(a) Any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in
any way related to the transfer or distribution of the Payment Account, must
be in writing or set forth in PDF, executed by the appropriate Party or
Parties as evidenced by the signatures of the person or persons signing this
Agreement or one of their designated persons as set forth in  _Schedule 1_
(each an " _Authorized Representative_ "). Except as provided in _Section 6_
above, no instruction from a Party for or related to the transfer or
distribution of the Merger Consideration shall be deemed delivered and
effective unless it shall be in writing executed by an Authorized
Representative, and Agent actually shall have received it on a Business Day by
facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email only at the fax number or email
address set forth in _Section 19_ (or for the Holders List, as set forth in
_Section 4_), and as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to a Partys
transmitting fax number or email address, and Agent has been able to satisfy
any applicable security procedures as may be required hereunder. Agent shall
not be liable to the Parties, any Company Holder, or other person for
refraining from acting upon any instruction from a Party for or related to the
transfer or distribution of the Merger Consideration if delivered to any
other fax number or email address, including, but not limited to, a valid
email address of any employee of Agent.

(b) In the event funds transfer instructions are set forth in a permitted
instruction from a Party or the Parties, Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such funds transfer instructions by a single telephone call-
back to one of the Authorized Representatives, and Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be that Authorized Representative. The
persons and telephone numbers designated for call-backs may be changed only in
a writing executed by Authorized Representatives and actually received by
Agent via facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email. Except as set forth in
_Section 6_ above, no funds will be disbursed until an Authorized
Representative is able to confirm such instructions by telephone call-back.
Agent, any intermediary bank and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer
may rely upon the identifying number of the beneficiarys bank or any
intermediary bank included in a funds transfer instruction provided by a
Party and confirmed by an Authorized Representative. Further, the
beneficiarys bank in the funds transfer instructions may make payment on the
basis of the account number provided in a Partys instruction and confirmed
by an Authorized Representative even though it identifies a person different
from the named beneficiary. Acquiror acknowledges that Agent is authorized to
use the following funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to
Acquiror under this Agreement without a verifying call-back:

 



\- 9 -  Bank Name:  _ _

 

Bank Address: _  _

ABA number: _ _

 

Account name:  _ _

Account number: _ _

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption,
transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open
networks such as the internet, and the Parties hereby agree that the Agent is
not liable for such risks absent the Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Parties acknowledge that these security procedures
are commercially reasonable.

21\. Construction with Merger Agreement. As among Acquiror, Stockholders
Agent, and the Company in the event that any of the terms and provisions of
the Merger Agreement conflict or are inconsistent with any of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement
in respect of the rights and duties of Acquiror, Stockholders Agent, and the
Company shall govern and control in all respects.

22. Miscellaneous. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed
that the intent of (a) the parenthetical "(solely on behalf of the
Stockholders and in its capacity as the Stockholders Agent, not in its
individual capacity)" in the first sentence of Section 15 and (b) the
description of the capacity of the Stockholders Agent in the opening
paragraph and the signature line of this Agreement is to clarify the
Stockholders Agents recourse to the Stockholders and not to limit the
Stockholders Agents capacity or liability as between itself and the Agent
under the indemnity in Section 15 or under any other provision in this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which Agent located at the
notice address set forth in _Section 19_ above is authorized or required by
law or executive order to remain closed. The provisions of this Agreement may
be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a
writing signed by Agent and an Authorized Representative of the Parties.
Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in
whole or in part by Agent or any Party, except as provided in _Section
13(b)_, without the prior written consent of Agent and the other Parties. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
New York. Each party irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue,
forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to
service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law
and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New
York. To the extent that in any jurisdiction any Party may now or hereafter be
entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution
attachment (before or after judgment), or other legal process, such Party
shall not claim, and it hereby irrevocably waives, such immunity. The Parties
and Agent further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to
any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement. No
party to this Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to, or if
it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement
because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical
outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond
its control. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together

 



\- 10 -   shall constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of the parties
to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or PDF, and such facsimile
or PDF will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such
party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If
any provision of this Agreement is determined to be prohibited or
unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such
provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other
jurisdiction. Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such
applicable law may be waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the
parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this
Agreement shall be enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in
_Section 15_ above, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
shall be construed to give to any person or entity other than Agent and the
Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any funds deposited hereunder.

Disclosures and Agreements

Patriot Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires Agent to implement reasonable
procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new account with
it. Accordingly, you acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and
Agents identity verification procedures require Agent to obtain information
which may be used to confirm your identity including without limitation name,
address and organizational documents ("identifying information"). You agree to
provide Agent with and consent to Agent obtaining from third parties any such
identifying information required as a condition of opening an account with or
using any service provided by the Agent.

OFAC Disclosure. Agent is required to act in accordance with the laws and
regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of money
laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not limited to
regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Agent is not
obligated to  execute payment orders or effect any other transaction where the beneficiary
or other payee is a person or entity with whom the Agent is prohibited from
doing business by any law or regulation applicable to Agent, or in any case
where compliance would, in Agents opinion, conflict with applicable law or
banking practice or its own policies and procedures. Where Agent does not
execute a payment order or effect a transaction for such reasons, Agent may
take any action required by any law or regulation applicable to Agent
including, without limitation, freezing or blocking funds.

Abandoned Property. Agent is required to act in accordance with the laws and
regulations of various states relating to abandoned property and, accordingly,
shall be entitled to remit dormant funds to any state as abandoned property
in accordance with such laws and regulations.

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.

 

Demand Deposit Account Disclosure. Agent is authorized, for regulatory
reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow demand
deposit account maintained in the U.S. in which the Fund is held into a non-
interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest bearing
savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis between
these internal accounts on Agents general ledger in accordance with U.S. law
at no cost to the Parties. Agent will record the internal accounts and any
transfers between them on Agents books and records only. The internal
accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the Fund, any
investment or disposition of the Fund, use of the escrow demand deposit
account or any other activities under this Agreement, except as described
herein. Agent will establish a target balance for the demand deposit internal
account, which may change at any time. To the extent funds in the demand
deposit internal account exceed the target balance, the excess will be
transferred to the savings internal account, unless the maximum number of
transfers from the savings internal account for that calendar month or
statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from the demand deposit
internal account exceeds the available balance in the demand deposit internal
account, funds from the savings internal account will be transferred to the
demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance of available funds in
the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and to replenish any
target balance that Agent has established for the demand deposit internal
account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a calendar month or statement
cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the savings internal account, and
such funds will remain in the demand deposit internal account for the
remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

Unlawful Internet Gambling. The use of any account to conduct transactions
(including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of funds through an
electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar instrument, or the
proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related, directly or indirectly,
to unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited. _EXHIBIT I_
