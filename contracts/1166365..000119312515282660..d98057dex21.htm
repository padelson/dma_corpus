Buyer agrees that, as to all communications among DLA Piper LLP (US), Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing that relate in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege belongs, to the
extent such privilege exists, to Seller and its Affiliates and may be controlled by Seller and its Affiliates and will not, with respect to such privileged communications, pass to or be claimed by Buyer or its Affiliates. To the extent that Buyer or
any of its Affiliates has or maintains any ownership of the privilege with respect to these communications, they agree, except as may be required by applicable Law, not to waive or to attempt to waive the privilege without the express written

privilege against such third party to prevent the disclosure of confidential communications by or with DLA Piper LLP (US). </P>
