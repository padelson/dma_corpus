Section 2.5 Limitations on Assignability.

 

(a) To the extent that Sellers rights under any Assumed Contract or Permit
constituting an Acquired Asset may not be assigned to Buyer without the
Consent of another Person which has not been obtained prior to the Closing,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same if an
attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful, and
Seller, shall cooperate in any commercially reasonable arrangement requested
by Buyer to provide to Buyer the benefits thereunder, including attempting to
obtain such consent after the Closing. If as of and from the Closing Date any
such Consent other than a Required Third Party Consent shall not be obtained
or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyers
rights under the Acquired Asset in question so that Buyer would not in effect
acquire the benefit of all such rights, Seller, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law and the Acquired Asset, shall act after the Closing as
Buyers agent in order to obtain for it the benefits thereunder and shall
cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and the Acquired Asset,
with Buyer in any other commercially reasonable arrangement designed to
provide such benefits to Buyer.

(b) Any Contract to be assigned, transferred and conveyed in accordance with
_Section 2.1_ that does not exclusively relate to the Business (each, a "
_Shared Contract"_ ) shall be assigned, transferred and conveyed only with
respect to (and preserving the meaning of) those parts that

 



19  relate to the Business to Buyer, if so assignable, transferrable or
conveyable, or appropriately amended prior to, on or after the Closing, so
that Buyer shall be entitled to the rights and benefit of those parts of the
Shared Contract that relate to the Business and shall assume the portion of
the Liabilities that relate to the Business under such Shared Contracts to the
extent as Assumed Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event
shall any Person be required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or
in part, any Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by
its terms without obtaining one or more Consents and (ii) if any Shared
Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot
be amended, without such Consent or Consents, then Seller will cooperate with
Buyer to establish an agency type or other similar arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer intended to both (x) provide to
the fullest extent practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights
and benefits of those parts that relate to the Business (including by means of
any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y) cause
Buyer to bear the costs and Liabilities thereunder to the extent an Assumed
Liability from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement to the
extent that Buyer receives the rights and benefits of the parts of the Shared
Contracts that relate to the Business. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
will promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any Liability to the extent
an Assumed Liability arising thereunder after the Closing Date to the extent
that Buyer receives the rights and benefits of the parts of such Shared
Contracts that relate to the Business.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at or
immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall terminate, effective upon the

Seller, including the termination or severance of insurance policies with
respect to coverage for the Business and the Acquired Assets, Tax services,
legal services and banking services (to include the severance of any
centralized clearance accounts), other than any such services provided
pursuant to an Assumed Contract or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

 _PURCHASE PRICE; PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT_

 

Section 3.1 Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer and delivery of the Acquired Assets to Buyer as of the
Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller or Sellers designees at the Closing an
aggregate purchase price equal to Two Hundred Eight Million Dollars
($208,000,000), as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ (the " _Purchase
Price_ ") and shall assume the Assumed Liabilities. The Purchase Price _minus_
the net amount of any Transfer Taxes related to the Owned Real Property due to
be paid by Seller at the Closing pursuant to  _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be paid
in cash by wire or intrabank transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts directed in writing by Seller.

 

Section 3.2 Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) _Initial Purchase Price Adjustment on Closing Date_. The Purchase Price
shall be adjusted on the Closing Date as set forth in this  _Section
3.2(a)_.

(i) Schedule A-1 (" _Estimated Net Working Capital Statement_ ") sets
forth Sellers good faith estimate of Net Working Capital of the Business as
of the expected

 



20  Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") calculated in
accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the
preparation of the Year-End Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal
year end, subject to the principles and methodology set forth on _Schedule
A-1_ but including accrued liabilities relating to amounts due to Hired
Employees under Sellers Long-Term Performance Cash Plan or Sellers Annual
Bonus Plan calculated in accordance with the principles and methodology set
forth on _Schedule A-2_ and _Schedule A-3_ , respectively.

(ii) If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net
Working Capital Amount, then the Purchase Price payable at the Closing will be
increased by an amount equal to such excess. If the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital Amount, then the Purchase
Price will be decreased by such deficit.

For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating any adjustments to the Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that any item adjusting the Purchase Price (including items
impacting the calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital) will not be
taken into account more than once if the effect would be to economically
duplicate such adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

(b) _Final Net Working Capital Statement_. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, but no later than the first (1st) Business Day that is sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its external
auditor (" _Buyer s Accountant_") to, prepare a statement (" _Final Net
Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the calculation of Net
Working Capital on the Closing Date on a basis consistent with that employed
in the preparation of the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and using
the principles and methodologies set forth in  _Section 3.2(a)(i)_ (the "
_Final Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the difference, if any, by which the
Final Net Working Capital is _less_ _than_ or _greater_ _than_ the Estimated
Net Working Capital (such difference the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ").

(c) _Protest Notice_. Within forty-five (45) days after Buyers or Buyers
Accountants delivery of the Final Net Working Capital Statement to Seller,
Seller may deliver written notice (the " _Protest Notice_ ") to Buyer setting
forth any objections to the amounts on the Final Net Working Capital
Statement, and the basis therefor. In the event that Seller does not object
within such forty-five (45) day period, the Final Net Working Capital
Statement shall be final and binding on Buyer and Seller. If Seller delivers
a Protest Notice within the prescribed time period, then Seller and Buyer
shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes as to the computation of
the Final Net Working Capital, within twenty (20) days after delivery of the
Final Net Working Capital Statement.

(d) _Resolution of Protests_. __

 

(i) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with
respect to the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital within twenty
(20) days following the delivery of any Protest Notice by Seller, then either
Seller or Buyer may

 



21  refer the items remaining in dispute to a nationally-recognized independent
accounting firm mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "). In such case, Seller and Buyer will jointly retain the
Independent Accounting Firm and direct it to render a written report setting
forth its determination of the Final Net Working Capital and resolving any and
all items remaining in dispute, not later than thirty (30) days after
acceptance of its retention. Seller and Buyer shall each submit to the
Independent Accounting Firm their respective computations of the Final Net
Working Capital and specific information, evidence and support for
their respective positions as to all items remaining in dispute.

(ii) Seller and Buyer, and their respective Representatives, shall cooperate
fully with the Independent Accounting Firm during its engagement and respond
on a timely basis to all requests for information or access to documents, data
and working papers or personnel made by the Independent Accounting Firm,
all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all disputes relating
to the Final Net Working Capital as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any ex parte meetings, teleconferences or
other communication, either written or oral, with the Independent Accounting
Firm as it is intended for Seller and Buyer to be included in all discussions
and correspondences with the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

(iii) The Independent Accounting Firm shall conduct its review, resolve all
items remaining in dispute and, to the extent necessary, compute the Final
Net Working Capital based on (1) the components set forth in the Final Net
Working Capital Statement that were not subject to a Protest Notice; (2) those
items that were the subject of dispute as set forth in a Protest Notice and
resolved by agreement of the Parties; and (3) its resolution of the items
remaining in dispute. The findings and determinations of the Independent
Accounting Firm as set forth in its written report to Seller and Buyer
shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties. In resolving
any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm (A) may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item proposed by Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be, or less than the least value for such item
proposed by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, (B) shall be bound by the
principles set forth in this _Section 3.2_ and (C) shall limit its review to
disputed items referred to it for resolution but shall resolve such disputed
items in a manner consistent with (1) the components set forth in the Final
Net Working Capital Statement that were not subject to a Protest Notice; and
(2) those items that were the subject of dispute as set forth in a Protest
Notice and resolved by agreement of the Parties.

(iv) The fees and expenses incurred by the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

(e) _Final Net Working Capital Adjustment_. Within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination of the Final Net Working Capital Statement, or
the failure of Seller to submit a timely Protest Notice: (i) if the Final Net
Working Capital is _less_   _than_ the Estimated Net Working Capital, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account(s) specified by Buyer, or (ii)
if the Final Net Working Capital is  _greater_ _than_ the Estimated Net
Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account(s)
specified by Seller.

 



22 Section 3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price plus Assumed
Liabilities shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets based on Buyers
purchase accounting allocation provided, however, that the Owned Real Property
shall be valued at Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the
" _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Buyer shall notify Seller of such Purchase
Price Allocation within twenty (20) Business Days of its determination. Seller
and Buyer and their Affiliates shall report, act and file all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in
a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation subject to appropriate
modification to each partys costs associated with this transaction. Neither
Seller nor Buyer shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so
by applicable Law. In the event that the Purchase Price Allocation hereto is
disputed by any Taxing Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute
shall promptly notify the other Party concerning the existence and resolution
of such dispute. In the event of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
hereunder, Buyer and Seller agree to adjust such allocation to reflect any
Purchase Price adjustment, if appropriate, in a manner consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation and to file consistently any Tax Returns and reports
required as a result of such Purchase Price adjustment.

 

Section 3.4 Proration. Buyer and Seller agree that those items listed below,
to the extent they relate to the Acquired Assets, will be prorated in a
reasonable manner and without duplication of any such items as of the Closing
Date, with Seller liable to the extent such items relate to any time period up
to the Closing Date, and Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to
periods on and after to the Closing Date (measured in the same units used to
compute the item in question, otherwise measured by calendar days). Unpaid
items for which Seller is liable shall be included as Liabilities on the
Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and the Final Net Working Capital
Statement and prepaid items for which Buyer is liable shall be included as
assets on the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and the Final Net
Working Capital Statement.

 

(a) any ad valorem taxes imposed on the tangible or intangible property
comprising the Acquired Assets shall be prorated based on the number of days
in such taxable period up to the Closing Date, and on the number of days in
such taxable period on and after the Closing Date;

 

(b) any permit, license, registration or compliance assurance fees with
respect to any Permit;

 

(c) fees or charges (other than Taxes) imposed by any Governmental Authority;

 

(d) sewer rents and charges for water, telephone, electricity and other
utilities and similar charges of Seller; and

 

(e) any prepaid expenses (including security deposits), payment obligations
for goods purchased or delivered, or services rendered, including rent under

either Seller or the Business is bound.

it under or in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to cause its Representatives to maintain in
confidence all information made available to them under or in connection with
this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent
provided in that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 15,
2014, (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between Sellers Affiliate
and Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all obligations of Buyer not to use
or disclose "Evaluation Materials" (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) that relate to the Business shall terminate as of the Closing.

 

(b) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, each Party shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, treat and hold as confidential and
not use, directly or indirectly, any confidential information pertaining to
the other Party that is not generally known within the relevant trade group or
by the public (the " _Confidential Information_ "), other than for the
benefit of the other Party or as provided in this _Section 7.1(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, confidential information pertaining to the Business that
is not generally known within the relevant trade group or by the public
shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of Buyer. If a Party or a
Representative of a Party is requested or required by oral or written request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process or by applicable Law to
disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party, then such Party
shall notify the other Party promptly, if permitted by applicable Law, of the
request or requirement so that the other Party, at its expense, may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with this _Section 7.1(b)_.
If, in the absence of a protective order or receipt of a waiver hereunder,
such Party or any of its Representatives is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose such Confidential Information, such Party or its
Representative may disclose such portion of the Confidential Information
which, on the advice of such Partys counsel, the applicable request or
requirement for disclosure requires be disclosed. Furthermore, the provisions
of this _Section 7.1_ will not prohibit any retention of copies by Seller of
Books and Records as set forth in _Section 4.3(f)_ or any disclosure in
connection with the preparation and finalizing of financial statements or Tax
Returns of Seller or its Affiliates or the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not apply to information of a Party
that: (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
disclosure by the other Party or its Representatives after the date hereof;
(ii) the other Party is entitled to use in accordance with the terms of the
Supply Agreement; or (iii) information that becomes available to the other
Party or any of its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source not
bound by a confidentiality obligation to such Party. Each Party acknowledges
and agrees that any breach of this _Section 7.1(b)_ by it would cause
irreparable harm to the other Party and that, in such event, the other Party
shall have the right, among other things, to seek preliminary and injunctive
relief, in addition to any other relief to which the other Party may be
entitled.

 



45 Section 7.2 Public Statements. Without the prior written approval of the other
Party, no Party shall issue, or permit any Representative of such Party to
issue, any press releases or otherwise make, or cause any Representative of
such Party to make, any public statements with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except when and to the
extent legal counsel to the releasing Party advises in writing that such
release or statement is required by applicable Law or under the applicable
rules and regulations of a stock exchange or market on which the securities
of the releasing Party or any of its Affiliates are listed. In each case to
which such exception applies, the releasing Party will provide a copy of such
release or statement to the other Party and incorporate any
reasonable changes which are suggested by the non-releasing Party prior to
releasing or making the statement.

Section 7.3 Tax Matters.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate, each at its own expense, to complete, to the extent required
by applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes. The Party responsible under applicable Law
for remitting any such Taxes shall notify the other Party of the amount
thereof, and such other Party shall pay fifty percent (50%) of such amount to
the responsible Party (i) at the Closing, to the extent that such amounts are
known at least ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date; or (ii) within
ten (10) Business Days of such notice. The responsible Party in turn shall
pay and remit the same to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Prior to a
Partys filing of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes, such Party shall provide such Tax Returns
to the other Party and that Party shall have up to ten (10) Business Days to
review and comment on such Tax Returns. All necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall be subject to the
other Partys approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. After a Party receives approval from the other Party, such Party
shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Transfer Taxes. Each Party agrees that it shall cooperate to timely
remit, or cause to be timely remitted, all such Transfer Taxes to the
appropriate Taxing Authority.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of
the Parties set forth in this _Section 7.3_ shall not be subject to any
restrictions or limitations other than those expressly set forth in this
_Section 7.3_ and shall survive the Closing.

 

(c) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any Taxing Authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to Liability for Taxes, and will retain any records or
information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, or any audit, or other
examination until the expiration of the limitations period for any such audit
or other examination and provide the same to the requesting Party. Any
information obtained pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(c)_ or pursuant to any
other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information or review of any
Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be kept confidential by
the Parties hereto.

 



46 (d) Buyer shall remit to Seller any refund or credit of Taxes, if and when
actually received by Buyer, to the extent such refund or credit is
attributable to Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets for any taxable
period, or portion thereof, ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(e) The Parties hereby agree that any and all indemnity payments pursuant to
this Agreement shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, be treated for
all Tax purposes by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(f) In the event that Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
disagree as to the amount or calculation of any payment to be made under this
Agreement relating to Taxes (other than the allocation of Purchase Price set
forth in _Section 3.4_), or the interpretation or application of any
provision under this Agreement relating to Taxes, the Parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within
sixty (60) days following the commencement of the dispute, Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall jointly retain the Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve the dispute. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
act as an arbitrator to resolve all points of disagreement and its decision
shall be final and binding upon all parties involved. Following the decision
of the Independent Accounting Firm, Buyer and Seller shall each take or cause
to be taken any action necessary to implement the decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses relating to the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

will not become a Hired Employee, and (ii) reports for work on the first day
after the Hire Date upon which such Business Employee is scheduled to work for

amounts paid under the Seller Plans prior to the Hire Date toward satisfaction
of applicable deductibles under Buyers corresponding welfare benefit plans.

similar records or as required by applicable Law.

Section 7.7 Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), each Party shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or provide goods,
technology or other assistance to others in engaging in the Restricted
Business of the other Party in the Territory; (ii) have an interest in any
Person that engages directly or indirectly in the Restricted Business of the
other Party in the Territory in any capacity, including as a partner,
shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or
(iii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client,
customer, supplier or licensor of the Restricted Business of the other Party
(including any existing or former client or customer of a Party and any Person
that becomes a client or customer of the Restricted Business after the
Closing), or any other Person who has a material business relationship with
the Restricted Business, to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective
relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may own, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any
national securities exchange if the Party is not a controlling Person of, or a
member of a group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or
indirectly, own five percent (5%) or more of any class of securities of such
Person.

(b) During the Restricted Period, each Party shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any Business
Employee or any other Person who is or was employed by the other Party during
the Restricted Period, or encourage any such employee to leave such
employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any
such employees; provided, that nothing in this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall
prevent a Party or any of its Affiliates from hiring any such employee (i)
whose employment has been terminated by other Party or (ii) after one hundred
eighty (180) days from the date of termination of such employees employment
by the other Party.

(c) Each Party acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
_Section 7.7_ would give rise to irreparable harm to the other Party, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that
in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by a Party of any such
obligations, the other Party shall, in addition to any and all other rights
and remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be
entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an
injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be
available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to
post bond).

 



50 (d) Each Party acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
7.7_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
other Party and constitute a material inducement to each Party to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 7.7_ should ever
be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product
or service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this _Section 7.7_ and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall preclude: (i) Seller or its
Affiliates from providing goods, technology or other assistance to others to
develop for, manufacture for or sell to Seller microencapsulation solutions
and materials for incorporation by Seller into Sellers end products, provided
that any such provision of goods, technology or other assistance and the
purchase of such microencapsulation solutions and materials by Seller complies
with the terms of the Supply Agreement, the License Agreement and any other
agreement entered into in the future by Seller and Buyer; or (ii) Buyer
from providing goods, technology or other assistance to others to develop,
manufacture and sell coated products provided that any such provision of
goods, technology or other assistance and the sale of such microencapsulation
solutions and materials by Buyer complies with the terms of the Supply
Agreement, the License Agreement and any other agreement entered into the
future by Seller and Buyer.

 

(f) Seller agrees, in consideration for the Purchase Price, to comply with the
terms of this _Section 7.7_. Buyer agrees, in consideration for Seller
entering into this Agreement and the Supply Agreement, to comply with the
terms of this _Section 7.7_.

 

(g) For purposes of this _Section 7.7_, Affiliates of Buyer shall not include
any direct or indirect owner of the ownership interests of Buyer other than
Sherman Capital Holdings, LLC and its Affiliates; provided that such direct or
indirect owner of ownership interests of Buyer is not a controlling Person
with respect to Buyer.

 

Section 7.8 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Buyer in acquiring the rights to use any third party Intellectual
Property necessary for the conduct of the Business on the same terms and
conditions available to Seller immediately prior to the Closing.

Section 7.9 Compliance with WEDC Loan Agreement Covenants. Following the
Closing Date and during the term of the WEDC Loan Agreement, (i) Buyer shall
operate the Business in a manner that complies with Sections 12(a), (d), (e),
(f) and (h) of the WEDC Loan

 



51  Agreement and shall not take any actions that would result in a breach of
Sellers covenants or representations and warranties under the WEDC Loan
Agreement, (ii) Buyer shall not terminate any Hired Employee if such
termination would result in the breach of the employment guaranties set forth
in Section 3 of Exhibit A of the WEDC Loan Agreement, and (iii) upon Sellers
request, Buyer shall promptly provide to Seller any information in the
possession of Buyer required by Seller to comply with any of the reporting
requirements set forth in the WEDC Loan Agreement.

 

Section 7.10 Cooperation in Litigation. In the event and for so long as any
Party actively is contesting or defending against or prosecuting any Action
that is (i) an Acquired Asset or an Assumed Liability or (ii) an Excluded
Asset or an Excluded Liability, in each case described in this clause (iii)
that is related to the Business, in connection with any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing,
the other Party will (i) cooperate with the contesting, defending
or prosecuting Party and its counsel in the contest, defense or prosecution,
(ii) make available its personnel who possess knowledge pertaining to such
Action to provide such recollections and explanations of events or documents,
to consult with respect to litigation and settlement discussions, to comply
with requests for depositions and for testimony, to assist with answering and
verifying interrogatory responses and responding to requests for the
production of documents, and to attend strategy sessions and judicial and
arbitration proceedings, and (iii) provide such access to its books and
records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest, defense or
prosecution.

 _LIMITED SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 8.1 Limited Survival.

of, this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date, after which they shall expire and be of no

_Section 6.3_ (collectively, the " _Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ")
shall survive the Closing for a period of 30 days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations.

 



52 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 8.1_, any claims asserted
in good faith with reasonable specificity and in writing by notice from the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _ARTICLE
8_ prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not
thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or
warranty and such claims shall survive until finally resolved.

Section 8.2 Buyer Indemnification Obligation. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this _ARTICLE 8_ , from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
covenants and agrees that it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller
and its Representatives (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party
(including, on and after the Closing Date) (whether or not brought by a third
party) arising out of (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (b) any breach or non-
fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement, (c) any Assumed Asset or Assumed Liability and

applicable to such representation or warranty.

 

Section 8.3 Seller Indemnification Obligation. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this _ARTICLE 8_ , from and after the Closing Date, Seller

and its Representatives (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against all Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party
(including, on and after the Closing Date) (whether or not brought by a third
party) arising out of (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement, (b) any breach or non-
fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Seller

respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 5.5(a)_
and _(b)_ , and _Section 5.6_ and the lists set forth in Schedules, _2.1(c)_
, _5.9(f)_ and  _5.11(a)_.

Section 8.4 Limitations of Liability.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 8.4_, the
indemnification obligations of the Parties shall be subject to the following
limitations:

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty by a Party in connection with
any single item or group of substantially related items that results in
Losses of less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (each, a " _Minor Claim_
") shall be deemed, for all purposes, not to be a breach of such
representation or warranty and in no case will any Minor Claims be included
or considered as Losses for purposes of calculating or administering the
Deductible;

 



53 (ii) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive any
indemnification payments under _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_, as
applicable, until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties for which they otherwise
would be entitled to indemnification hereunder, as the case may be, equals or
exceeds one percent (1.0%) of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent
of such excess (the " _Deductible_ "); provided, however, that the Deductible
shall not apply to Losses arising out of any breach of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations or Buyer Fundamental Representations;

 

(iii) the Liabilities of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, as a result of
its indemnification obligations under  _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_
(other than the Liabilities of Seller as a result of its indemnification
obligations under _Section 8.3(a)_ arising out of breaches of Sellers
representations and warranties under _Section 5.9)_ shall not exceed in the
aggregate six and one half percent (6.5%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_
"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to Losses arising out of
any breach of any of the Seller Fundamental Representations or Buyer
Fundamental Representations;

(iv) the Liabilities of Seller as a result of its indemnification obligations
under _Section 8.3(a)_ arising out of breaches of Sellers representations
and warranties under _Section 5.9_ shall not exceed in the aggregate nine
percent (9%) of the Purchase Price _ minus_ the amount of the Liabilities of
Seller as a result of its indemnification obligations under _Section 8.3(a)_
arising out of any breach of any of the Sellers representations and
warranties other than any of the Seller Fundamental Representations or the
Sellers representations and warranties under _Section 5.9_; and

(v) except as otherwise expressly provided in this _ARTICLE 8_ , the
indemnification provided for in this _ARTICLE 8_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy following the Closing for any breach of representations,
warranties and covenants and agreements (which covenants and agreements are,
by their terms, meant to be fully performed prior to Closing) made by the
Parties and in calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount
of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any
other Losses for which an Action has actually been made under any other
representation, warranty covenant, or agreement included herein; provided,
however, that nothing in this _Section 8.4(a)(v)_ shall limit any Persons
right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be
entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Partys fraud.

 

(b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided by the
Indemnifying Parties under _Section 8.2_ or  _Section 8.3_ shall be net of
any (i) Tax benefits available to the Indemnified Parties taking into account
any income or loss of deduction in respect of any Losses for which such
indemnification payment is made and (ii) amounts recovered or recoverable by
the Indemnified Parties under applicable insurance policies, but taking into
account any deductible or retention and initial premium increase resulting
therefrom,

 



54  therefore, net of the Indemnified Parties reasonable costs of recovery, it
being understood and agreed that (1) the Indemnified Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to seek insurance recoveries in respect of
Losses to be indemnified hereunder and (2) if the amount of any Loss, at any
time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is
reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any
insurance coverage, or pursuant to any Action, recovery, settlement or payment
by, from or against any other entity, then the amount of such reduction, less
any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection therewith (together
with interest thereon from the date of payment thereof to the date of
repayment) shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) A Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under
this _ARTICLE 8_ for any Loss to the extent such matter is reflected or
included as a liability in the Final Net Working Capital Statement.

(d) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY
SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY) OR OTHERWISE, AT LAW OR IN
EQUITY, OR FOR A PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS
OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE (BASED ON A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OR OTHERWISE) EXCEPT
IN THE CASE OF FRAUD OR TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY AWARDED TO A GOVERNMENTAL
AUTHORITY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY IN ANY THIRD PARTY ACTION.

 

Section 8.5 Notice; Duty to Mitigate.

 

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the Indemnifying
Parties within a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of any breach
by such other Party of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation in this Agreement. The failure of such Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
liability hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by the failure to give such notice.

(b) With respect to any matter subject to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate to, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to, minimize both the Loss and any adverse
effects on the Business resulting therefrom as if all such Loss and adverse
effects were for the account of such Person including (i) in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third Party Actions,
and (ii) in pursuing its rights against insurance carriers and other third
Persons from whom recovery of such Loss may be available, _provided_ that all
Losses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in pursuing any such
rights shall be subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that the
efforts contemplated by the preceding sentence involve the institution or
assertion of an Action against a third Person and the Indemnifying Party
request that the Indemnified Party institute or assert such Action, the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to institute or assert such Action,
but if they do not institute or assert such Action they shall assign their
rights thereto to the Indemnifying Party.

 



55 Section 8.6 Procedure with Respect to Third Party Claims. Subject to 
_Section 7.3_ which shall govern Tax Claims and _Section 8.7_ which shall
govern Environmental Actions, the following provisions shall apply.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party becomes subject to a pending or threatened Action
of a third party (each, a " _Third Party Action_ ") and believes it has an
Action against an Indemnifying Party as a result, then such Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the basis for such Action
setting forth the nature of the Action in reasonable detail, as soon
as practical following the time at which the Indemnified Party discovered, or
reasonably should have discovered, such Action. The failure of such
Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of liability hereunder except to the extent that the
defense of such Action is prejudiced by the failure to give such notice.

(b) If any Third Party Action is brought against such Indemnified Party and
such Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Section 8.6_, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
such Action and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such
Third Party Action, if the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to such
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such
defense. The Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right
to employ separate counsel in any such Action and to participate in the
defense thereof, and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
paid by such Indemnified Party.

 

(c) If notice is given to the Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party of
the commencement of any Third Party Action and the Indemnifying Party does
not give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense
of such legal proceeding within the earlier of (i) the date that any response
to such Third Party Action is due or (ii) thirty (30) days after receiving
such notice, then such Indemnified Party shall (upon notice to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense or compromise of
such Action; _provided_ , that (x) the Indemnified Party cannot settle any
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be delayed or withheld unreasonably and (xi) the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs of
defending against such Third Party Action (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section
8.6_, if (i) an Indemnified Party determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable probability that a Third Party Action may result in the Indemnified
Party incurring Loss in excess of that subject to indemnification under this
Agreement or (ii) the Third Party Action involves a temporary restraining
order or preliminary injunction or other significant component of injunctive
or other equitable relief, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the
Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or
settle such Third Party Action; provided, in each case, that the Indemnified
Party shall be prohibited from compromising or settling such Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
content shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(e) If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Action
pursuant to _Section 8.6(c)_ or _Section 8.6(d)_, then the Indemnifying
Party may elect to participate in such legal proceedings, negotiations or
defense at its own expense.

 



56 (f) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall grant Seller (or their respective
designees), access at all reasonable times upon reasonable notice to all of
the Business Books and Records dated on or prior to the Closing Date, and
shall afford such Person the right to take extracts therefrom and to make
copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate or defend any Third Party Actions covered by
this Agreement.

 

Section 8.7 Procedures and Rights Relating to Indemnification for
Environmental Liabilities.

 

(a) The defense, prosecution, investigation, containment and/or Remediation of
any such Environmental Liability that is the subject of an indemnification
claim by Buyer related to a breach of any representation or warranty in
_Section 5.9_ (such defense, prosecution, investigation, containment and/or
Remediation an " _Environmental Action_ ") shall be controlled by Seller or,
if Seller elects not to do so, Buyer (such controlling Party is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Controlling Party_ ").

 

(b) Unless the Parties jointly agree that a Consultant is not necessary, the
Controlling Party shall retain a qualified independent environmental
consultant (" _Consultant_ "), which Consultant shall be subject to the other
Partys (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld). The Controlling Partys contract with the Consultant
shall expressly state that the Non-Controlling Party may rely upon
Consultants work. The Controlling Party shall undertake such defense,
prosecution, investigation, containment and/or Remediation in a commercially
reasonable fashion in accordance with Environmental Laws for facilities of the
type being remediated such that any Remediation complies with the minimum
requirements of Environmental Laws, except that any Remediation shall not
result in the implementation of an activity and use limitation, institutional
control, other legally binding restriction or otherwise unreasonably interfere
with the Business, the occupancy, use or activities at the property which is
the subject of the Remediation, and Controlling Party shall not cause,
through its own inaction, any undue delay in obtaining written notice from the
appropriate regulatory body that no further investigation or Remediation is
necessary with respect to the matter that is the subject of the
indemnification claim, or, if no regulatory body is involved in such matter,
either a good faith determination from the Consultant that no further
investigation or Remediation is required to bring the property that is
the subject of the Remediation into conformance with the minimum requirements
of Environmental Laws for facilities of the type being remediated or other
resolution of the investigation or Remediation reasonably acceptable to the
Non-Controlling Party. The Controlling Party shall promptly provide copies to
the Non-Controlling Party of all notices, correspondence, data, draft reports,
submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give the Non-Controlling
Party at least ten (10) calendar days (at the Non-Controlling Partys own
expense) to comment on any submissions the Controlling Party intends to
deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to said submission
_provided_ , _however_ , the Controlling Party shall not make such submission
to the appropriate regulatory body without a prior approval of the Non-
Controlling Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or unduly
delayed). The Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with
reasonable access to the Consultant and employees with knowledge of relevant
facts and the right (with reasonable prior notice) to attend all meetings and
participate in any telephone or other conference with any regulatory body or
other third party regarding the Remediation, if permitted by applicable Law.
The Non-Controlling Party may, at its own

 



57  expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
monitor the defense, prosecution, investigation, containment and/or
Remediation, including any field work undertaken by the Controlling Party,
and the Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with copies
of the results of all such field work. The Controlling Party shall keep the
Non-Controlling Party reasonably advised of the status of the
defense, prosecution, investigation, containment and/or Remediation and shall
provide the Non-Controlling Party reasonable notice and opportunity to comment
(at the Non-Controlling Partys own expense) upon the Controlling Partys
plans to address such defense. The type of Remediation undertaken by the
Controlling Party and the results thereof and the settlement of any
Environmental Action shall be subject to the approval of the Non-Controlling
Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
above, the Non-Controlling Party shall not take any actions that shall
unreasonably interfere with the Controlling Partys performance of the
defense, prosecution, investigation, containment and/or Remediation,
nor shall the implementation of the Remediation hereunder unreasonably
interfere with the Non-Controlling Partys operation of its business, unless
otherwise required by a Governmental Authority.

 

(c) The Non-Controlling Party shall grant the Controlling Party and its
Consultants, or any other qualified consultant or subcontractor engaged by
the Controlling Party to perform the Remediation, access as reasonably
necessary for the completion of the Remediation, subject to the following
conditions: (i) the Non-Controlling Party shall receive at least two working
days advance notice of Consultants or Representatives intention to
initially enter the properties to conduct the remedial work; however, such
time period may be shortened by agreement between the Parties; and (ii) the
access to the properties granted by the Non-Controlling Party hereunder shall
be limited to access reasonably necessary for the execution and supervision of
the Remediation, and the Controlling Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to complete the Remediation in accordance with the schedule
referenced in the scope of work for the relevant property; (iii) the
Controlling Party shall require the Consultants and their Representatives
to procure and maintain insurance consistent with industry practices; and
(iv) following the execution of the Remediation, and in no case later than
thirty (30) days after on-site activities have been completed, the Controlling
Party shall undertake commercially reasonable measures (determined from the
perspective of an objective commercially reasonable Person who was both paying
the cost of restoration and operating the Business on the property that was
the subject of the Remediation) to return the properties to their condition
prior to the taking of the Remediation (absent the contamination that was the
subject of the Remediation), and arrange for the prompt removal of all
equipment and materials brought to the Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property by Consultants or any of their Representatives during the course of
the Remediation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _ARTICLE 8_ to the contrary, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recovery for Losses related to
environmental matters to the extent resulting from: (A) a material change
after the Closing in any of the uses of the Owned Real Property or Leased
Real Property; (B) the cost of removal or treatment of any substance that can
be managed in place in a commercially reasonable fashion while complying with
the minimum requirements of Environmental Law for facilities of the type
being remediated, to the extent such management in place does not unreasonably
interfere with the Business, occupancy, use or activities at the property
which is the subject of the Remediation, (C) any change in Laws occurring
after the Closing Date, (D) any gross negligence or willful

 



58  misconduct of Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date, or (E)
any subsurface sampling or laboratory analysis of such sampling, any
subsurface investigation, or any communication with any Governmental
Authority by or on behalf of Buyer after the Closing Date unless (and only to
the extent) such sampling, analysis, investigation or communication (i) is
required by Environmental Law, (ii) arises in the ordinary course of business
out of repairs, modifications, maintenance activities, construction or other
capital projects, in each case relating to the Business and conducted
consistent with industry practices, (iii) is required pursuant to a regularly
scheduled, periodic environmental compliance audit, conducted in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with Sellers documented practices as in
effect on the Closing Date and provided to Buyer, or (iv) arises in
response to a request of a Governmental Authority.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) in the case of 
_Section 8.7(d)(E)(i)_, any such sampling, analysis, investigation or
communication shall not be considered as "required by Environmental Law" to
the extent that such sampling, analysis, investigation or communication occurs
as a result of (1) a material change after the Closing of any of the uses of
the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property, or (2) due diligence
conducted by or for a future purchaser or future purchasers financing source;
and (ii) in the case of _Section 8.7(d)(E)(iii)_, any such sampling,
analysis, investigation, or communication shall only be considered as required
pursuant to such audit to the extent that there is substantial visual, sensory
or documentary evidence of potential non-compliance with Environmental Law.
The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall share such factual evidence with Seller by
written notice given in accordance with this Agreement in every instance
before any such sampling, analysis, investigation or communication occurs. In
no event shall this requirement be construed to require the Buyer Indemnified
Parties to provide Seller with a copy of its internal audit report. Failure by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties to provide notice as described herein to Seller
on a timely basis shall not relieve Seller of its indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the delay is unreasonably prejudicial to
Seller. The foregoing shall not constitute a waiver by Seller of any claim
for direct damages caused by such delay.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recovery for Losses related to environmental
matters to the extent resulting from a change, alteration, or addition to a
building, structure, fixture, or equipment (whether intentional or
unintentional) as a result of which action any condition which was compliant
with Environmental Laws as of the Closing becomes noncompliant.

(g) In the event of any conflict between the terms of this _Section 8.7_ and
any other provision of _ARTICLE 8_ with respect to indemnification claims
relating to Environmental Liabilities, the terms of this _Section 8.7_
shall control. Any disputes between the Parties regarding the procedures and
rights set forth in this _Section 8.7_ shall be settled pursuant to the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 9.8_ of this Agreement.

Section 9.1 Amendment and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Buyer and Seller. Furthermore, no amendment of any provision of this Agreement
that may adversely alter or

 



59  change the rights of the Lenders under its financing shall be valid unless
the same shall have been approved in writing by the Lenders. Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of any other acts of the other Party,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other Party
pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other Party or conditions to such Partys obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of a Party to assert any of its
rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth below using the
following means: facsimile transmission, personal delivery, messenger service,

Section 9.3 Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Party. Except with respect to the rights of the
Lenders solely with respect to _Section 9.1_ hereof, this Agreement is not
intended to confer upon any other Person except the Parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement shall confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person, including any employee or former employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), other than the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and the rights of
Lenders solely with respect to _Section 9.1_ hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer has made a collateral assignment of this Agreement to its
Lenders. If Buyer assigns this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder, Buyer shall remain liable to Seller for all of Buyers
obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Upon any such permitted assignment,
the references in this Agreement to Buyer shall refer to such assignee unless
the context otherwise requires.

 

Section 9.4 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. 

Section 9.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 9.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all exhibits and
schedules hereto and all other documents and instruments delivered in
connection herewith, including the Ancillary Agreements, constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 9.7 Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws. Buyer waives compliance with the
provisions of the bulk sales or transfer Laws, if any, of all applicable
jurisdictions and Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any Liabilities of Seller
(other than Assumed Liabilities) asserted against Buyer as the result of such
non-compliance.

 



61 Section 9.8 Dispute Resolution.

 

(a) _Referral to Senior Executives_. In the event of any Action, dispute or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement (each, a " _Dispute_
"), the Parties shall promptly seek to resolve any such Dispute by
negotiations between senior executives of the Parties who have the authority
to settle the Dispute. When a Party believes there is a Dispute, that Party
shall give the other Party written notice of the Dispute. Within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of such notice, the other Party shall submit to the other a
written response. Both the notice and response shall include (i) a
statement of each Partys position and a summary of the evidence and
arguments supporting such position; and (ii) the name, title, fax number and
telephone number of the executive or executives who shall represent the Party.
In the event that the Dispute involves an Action arising out of the actions
of any Person not a signatory to this Agreement, the receiving Party shall
have such additional time as necessary, not to exceed an additional fifteen
(15) days, to investigate the Dispute before submitting a written response.
The executives shall meet at a mutually agreeable time and place within seven
(7) days after the date of the response and thereafter as often as they
reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt to
resolve the Dispute. If one of the executives intends to be accompanied at a
meeting by an attorney, the other executive shall be given a least five (5)
Business Days notice of such intention and may also be accompanied by an
attorney.

(b) _Remedies_. If the Dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days
after the date of the response given pursuant to _Section 9.8(a)_, or such
additional time, if any, that the Parties mutually agree to in writing, or if
any Party receiving a Dispute notice denies the applicability of the
provisions of this Section or otherwise refuses to participate under the
provisions hereof, either Party may pursue, subject to any applicable
limitations set forth in _Section 9.11_ and elsewhere herein, such remedies
as are available to it at Law or in equity.

 

(c) _Exclusive Jurisdiction._ The Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit and
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located
in the State of Delaware and irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way
of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Dispute, any Action that it is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts,
that the Dispute is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue is
improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

 

(d) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE AGREEMENT OF EACH PARTY TO
WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WILL BE BINDING ON ITS SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS AND WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.9 No Construction Against Drafting Party. The language used in this
Agreement is the product of both Parties efforts and each Party hereby
irrevocably waives the benefits of any rule of contract construction that
disfavors the drafter of a Contract or the drafter of specific words in a
Contract. 

 



62 Section 9.10 Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any
other provision. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
unenforceable or invalid, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a legally acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 Cumulative Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party to this
Agreement will be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
contained in this Agreement, at Law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, the exercise by a Party to this Agreement of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

Section 9.12 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation, execution and Closing of this Agreement and
the sale of the Acquired Assets (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
financial advisors and accountants).

Section 9.13 Privilege. Buyer agrees that, as to all communications among DLA
Piper LLP (US), Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing that relate in
any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the
attorney-client privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege exists, to
Seller and its Affiliates and may be controlled by Seller and its Affiliates
and will not, with respect to such privileged communications, pass to or be
claimed by Buyer or its Affiliates. To the extent that Buyer or any of its
Affiliates has or maintains any ownership of the privilege with respect to
these communications, they agree, except as may be required by applicable Law,
not to waive or to attempt to waive the privilege without the express
written approval of Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises between Buyer and a third party (other than Seller and its
Affiliates) or any Governmental Authority after the Closing, Seller may assert
the attorney-client privilege against such third party to prevent the
disclosure of confidential communications by or with DLA Piper LLP (US).
