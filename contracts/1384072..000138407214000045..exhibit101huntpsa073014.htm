based upon or measured by the ownership or operation 

of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding any
other Taxes), (ii) capital expenditures incurred in the ownership,
development, operation and maintenance of the Assets in the ordinary course of
business, (iii) where applicable, such costs and capital expenditures charged
in accordance with the relevant operating agreement, unit agreement, pooling
agreement, pre-pooling agreement, pooling order or similar instrument, or if
none, charged to the Assets on the same basis as charged on the date of this
Agreement, and (iv) overhead costs charged to the Assets by unaffiliated third
parties under the relevant operating agreement, unit agreement, pooling
agreement, pre-pooling agreement, pooling order or similar instrument by

basis as charged on the date of this Agreement; provided that "Property Costs"
shall exclude, without limitation, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses
attributable to (i) claims, investigations, administrative proceedings or
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from actual or
claimed personal injury or death, property damage or violation of any Law

or elsewhere in this Agreement. For the purposes of calculating the
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2 or implementing the terms
of Section 7.8 or Article 11, (A) right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and
Property Costs (excluding Taxes which are addressed in clauses (B), (C), and
(D) of this sentence) delay rentals, lease bonuses, minimum royalties, option
payments, lease extension payments and shut-in royalties that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before, or at and after, the Effective Time (B) ad valorem,
property, severance, production or similar Taxes which are based on the
quantity of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned
between Seller and Purchaser based on the number of units or value of
production actually produced, as applicable, before, and after, the Effective
Time, (C) other ad valorem, property, severance, production or similar Taxes
shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling
before, or at and after, the Effective Time, and (D) all other Taxes shall be
apportioned based on an interim closing of the books of Seller as of the
Effective Time.

Section 1.5 Delivery and Maintenance of Records and Retained Records.

Purchaser and information subject to an applicable confidentiality restriction
in favor of third parties) for review and copying at Purchaser's expense and
to Purchaser's and its Affiliates' employees for the purpose of discussing any
such claim; provided, however, that the Retained Records and the information

notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or therein shall
remain in full force and effect as to the Retained Records for such seven (7)
year period.

ARTICLE 2 

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 Purchase Price.

The purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall be Two Hundred
Seventy-eight Million Dollars ($278,000,000.00), and shall be adjusted as
provided in Section 2.2 (the "Adjusted Purchase Price").

Section 2.2 Adjustments to Purchase Price.

The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all such
amounts being determined in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards (with
such adjustments being made so as to not give duplicative effect):

(a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received and
retained by Seller between the Effective Time and the Closing Date (with the
period between 

the Effective Time and the Closing Date referred to as the "Adjustment
Period"): (i) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any royalties,
overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of production,
gathering, processing and transportation costs and any production, severance,
sales, use or excise Taxes not reimbursed to Seller by the purchaser of
production) produced from the Properties during the Adjustment Period and (ii)
proceeds from unaffiliated third parties with respect to the Gas Plants,
including any revenues from the gathering, transporting, processing or
fractionation of Hydrocarbons or other similar processes or activities
performed at or in connection with the Gas Plants;

(b) Reduced in accordance with Section 3.5, by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of those Properties (i) with respect to which preferential
purchase rights have been exercised prior to Closing or (ii) that cannot be
transferred due to unsatisfied and unwaived requirements for consent to the
assignments contemplated hereby in each case determined without regard to the
Individual Defect Deductible or the Defect Deductible;

(c) Reduced in accordance with Section 7.7 by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of those Properties that are subject to a suit, action or proceeding
prior to Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a
claim to enforce preferential rights;

(d) (i) Subject to Section 3.4(i), reduced by the applicable Title Defect
Amount as a result of Title Defects for which the Title Defect Amount has been
finally determined or agreed pursuant to Section 3.4 (or, for purposes of the
Closing Payment, pursuant to Seller's good faith estimate), and by the
Allocated Value of any Title Defect Property retained by Seller pursuant to
Section 3.4(d)(ii) and (ii) increased by the applicable Title Benefit Amount
as a result of Title Benefits for which the Title Benefit Amount has been
finally determined or agreed pursuant to Section 3.4;

(e) Reduced by the Allocated Values of any Properties excluded by Seller
pursuant to Section 3.6;

(f) Reduced by (i) subject to Section 4.4, any amount agreed upon by Purchaser
and Seller pursuant to Section 4.4(a) regarding the reasonable estimate of the
cost of curing Environmental Liabilities for any affected Property not
retained by Seller, and (ii) the Allocated Value of any Property retained by
Seller pursuant to Section 4.4(b);

(g) Increased by the amount equal to the value of all of Seller's inventories
of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties that are in
storage above the pipeline connection as of the Effective Time as measured by
tank straps, gauge lines and/or gauge sheets (which value shall be computed
using the Index Price without differentials for transportation, gravity,
quality, basis or location), less any applicable severance Taxes, royalties
and similar burdens; provided, however, that the adjustment contemplated by
this paragraph shall be only made to the extent that Seller does not receive
and retain the proceeds, or portion thereof, attributable to the sale of such
Hydrocarbons; 

(h) Increased by (i) the amount of all Property Costs and other costs
attributable to the ownership, development, operation and maintenance of the
Assets that are paid by Seller and incurred on or after the Effective Time (or
with respect to any period on or after the Effective Time) including any costs
with respect to the Gas Plants but excepting any Property Costs and other such
costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.2(a) and
(ii) the amount of any proceeds with respect to the Gas Plants which are
attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time and received
and retained by Purchaser, including any revenues from the gathering,
transporting, processing or fractionation of Hydrocarbons or other similar
processes or activities performed at or in connection with the Gas Plants
attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time;

(i) Increased by an amount equal to the value of Imbalances owed to Seller as
of the Effective Time and decreased by an amount equal to the value of
Imbalances owed by Seller as of the Effective Time, in each case with the
value to be based on $4.49 per MMBTU and $103.07 per barrel;

(j) Decreased in accordance with Section 7.10, as applicable.

The adjustment described in Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the
amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during the
Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and
Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or
income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has
been made.

Section 2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price.

Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller will
agree upon an allocation of the purchase price for the Assets (as determined
for applicable Tax purposes) among each of the Assets, in compliance with the
principles of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the Treasury regulations thereunder. Such allocation of
value shall be attached to this Agreement as Schedule 2.3. The "Allocated
Value" for any Asset equals the portion of such purchase price allocated to
such Asset on Schedule 2.3, increased or decreased as described in Section
2.2. Except to the extent attributable to any specific Assets, any adjustments
to the Purchase Price (including any indemnification payment treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes) other than the adjustments
provided for in Sections 2.2(b), 2.2(c), 2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.2(f) shall, to
the extent permitted by Section 1060 of the Code, be applied on a pro rata
basis in proportion to the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.3 for all Assets
for applicable Tax purposes only. After all such adjustments are made, any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 2.2(b), 2.2(c), 2.2(d),
2.2(e) and 2.2(f) and any adjustments attributable to any specific Assets
shall be applied to the amounts set forth in Schedule 2.3 for the particular
affected Assets. After Seller and Purchaser have agreed on the Allocated
Values for the Assets, Seller will be deemed to have accepted such Allocated
Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, but otherwise makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy
of such values. Seller and Purchaser agree (i) that the Allocated Values, as
adjusted pursuant to this paragraph, shall be used by Seller and Purchaser as
the basis for reporting asset 

values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax
Returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) that, except as
required by applicable Law, neither they nor their Affiliates will take
positions inconsistent with the Allocated Values (as adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph) in any Tax Returns, in notices to Governmental Bodies, in audit or
other proceedings with respect to Taxes, in notices to preferential purchase
right holders, or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party hereto.
Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon
receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment
challenging the Allocated Values, and neither party shall agree to any
proposed adjustment to the Allocated Values by any Governmental Body without
first giving to the other party prior written notice. However, nothing
contained herein shall prevent either party from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Body based upon or arising out of
the Allocated Values, and neither party shall be required to litigate any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Body challenging such
Allocated Values. Purchaser and Seller further agree that, on or before the
Closing Date, they will mutually agree as to the further allocation of the
Allocated Values included in Schedule 2.3 as to the relative portion of those
values attributable to leasehold costs and depreciable equipment.

Section 2.4 Deposit.

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has paid to
Seller an earnest money deposit in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Deposit"). The Deposit shall be non-interest bearing and
applied against the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs or shall be otherwise
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 3

(i) defects based solely on a lack of information in Seller's files or
references to a document if such document is not in Seller's files;

(ii) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization

title to the relevant Asset;

(iv) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitation or
prescription;

(vii) defects based upon the failure to record any state or federal Leases or
rights-of-way included in the Assets or any assignments of interests in such
Leases or rights-of-way included in the Assets in any applicable county or
parish records;

(viii) any encumbrance or loss of title resulting from Seller's conduct of
business in compliance with this Agreement;

(ix) encumbrances created under deeds of trust, mortgages and similar
instruments by the lessor under a Lease covering the lessor's surface and
mineral interests in the land covered thereby that would customarily be
accepted in taking or purchasing such Leases and for which the lessee would
not customarily seek a subordination of such encumbrance to the oil and gas
leasehold estate prior to conducting drilling activities on the Lease;

(x) encumbrances created under deeds of trust, mortgages and similar
instruments by the grantor under a right-of-way that would customarily be
accepted in taking or purchasing such rights-of-way; and

(xi) defects disclosed herein (including on any Schedule or Exhibit).

As used herein, the term "Permitted Encumbrances" means any or all of the
following:

(a) Royalties, nonparticipating royalty interests, net profits interests and
any overriding royalties, reversionary interests and other burdens to the
extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce Seller's Net
Revenue Interest below that shown in Schedule 2.3 or increase Seller's working

the Net Revenue Interest;

(b) All leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, pre-pooling agreements,

(h) Rights of reassignment arising upon final intention to abandon or release
all or any part of the Assets;

(i) Easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other
rights in respect of surface operations to the extent that they do not,
individually or in the aggregate: (i) reduce Seller's Net Revenue Interest

Section 3.4 Notice of Title Defects Defect Adjustments.

(a) To assert a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim notices to Seller
(each a "Title Defect Notice") on or before the date that is thirty (30) days
from the date hereof (the "Title Claim Date"), except as otherwise provided
under Sections 3.5 or 3.6. Each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the
Leases, Units or Wells affected by the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect
Property"), (iii) the Allocated Values of each Title Defect Property, (iv)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Defect(s) and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the
Allocated Values of each Title Defect Property are reduced by the alleged
Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Purchaser's
belief is based. Subject to Section 7.9, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived for all purposes hereunder all Title Defects that were not included in
a Title Defect Notice delivered to Seller on or before the Title Claim Date.
To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing alleged Title
Defects, Purchaser agrees to provide Seller, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Title Claim Date, written notices of all Title
Defects discovered by Purchaser during the preceding calendar week, which
notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Title Claim
Date. Purchaser shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any
Title Benefit that is discovered by any of 

Purchaser's representatives, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners
while conducting Purchaser's due diligence with respect to the Assets prior to
the Title Claim Date.

(b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser with respect to each Title Benefit a written notice (a "Title
Benefit Notice") asserting such Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date. Each Title Benefit Notice shall include (i) a description of the Title
Benefit(s), (ii) the Leases, Units or Wells affected by the Title Benefit
(each a "Title Benefit Property"), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Title
Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser
(as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser) to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Benefit(s) and (v) the amount by which Seller
reasonably believes the Allocated Values of those Units or Wells are increased
by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Seller's
belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived for all purposes
hereunder all Title Benefits that were not included in a Title Benefit Notice
delivered to Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date.

(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon delivering
written notice to Purchaser, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove
any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Purchaser on or before the
expiration of sixty (60) days counted from and after the Title Claim Date (the
"Cure Period"), unless the parties otherwise agree. If Seller has provided
notice at or prior to the Closing Date of Seller's intent to attempt to cure a
Title Defect within the Cure Period, there shall be no reduction to the
Purchase Price with respect to the Title Defect for purposes of Closing. If at
the end of the Cure Period the Title Defect is not cured as agreed by Seller
and Purchaser or if Seller and Purchaser cannot agree, and it is determined by
the Title Arbitrator that such Title Defect is not cured at the end of the
Cure Period, Seller shall elect one of the options set forth in Section
3.4(d)(i), or 3.4(d)(ii)(B) for such Title Defect, in which event the Purchase
Price adjustment required in connection with the selected option under this
Article 3 shall be made in the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 9.4(b). No action of Seller in electing or attempting to
cure a Title Defect shall constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect.

(d) In the event that (I) any Title Defect asserted by Purchaser in accordance
with Section 3.4(a) is not waived by Purchaser and (II) Seller has not
provided notice to Purchaser at or prior to the Closing Date of Seller's
intent to attempt to cure the given Title Defect, or Seller has provided such
notice but the Title Defect is not cured before the expiration of the Cure
Period, then Seller shall, at its sole election, elect to:

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant
to Section 3.4(f) or 3.4(h);

(ii) (A) at Closing, retain the Property that is associated with such Title
Defect, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Property or (B) promptly after expiration of
the Cure Period have Purchaser reconvey the Property that is associated with
such Title Defect 

to Seller, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Property, adjusted as provided in Section
2.2; or

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10.

(e) Remedies for Title Benefits. In the event that any Title Benefit asserted
by Seller in accordance with Section 3.4(b) is not waived by Seller, then:

(i) to the extent Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount as
calculated pursuant to Section 3.4(g), the Purchase Price shall be increased
by such amount; and

(ii) to the extent there is no agreement under Section 3.4(e)(i) on or before
the Closing Date, the disagreement between Seller and Purchaser regarding the
Title Benefit Property or the Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, shall be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 3.4(h).

(f) The "Title Defect Amount" resulting from a Title Defect shall be
determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest as
identified on Schedule 2.3, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product
of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the actual amount of the decrease in Net Revenue
Interest from that identified on Schedule 2.3 and the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest as identified on Schedule 2.3; provided, however,
that if the Title Defect does not affect the Title Defect Property throughout
its entire life, the Title Defect Amount shall be reduced to take into account
the applicable time period only;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, then the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by
the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic
effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the
values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; 

(v) if the Title Defect represents (I) a discrepancy between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest as identified on Schedule 2.3, and (II) an obligation, encumbrance,
burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by applying both of
subsections (iii) and (iv) to such Title Defect, without duplication; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

(g) The "Title Benefit Amount" resulting from a Title Benefit shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the actual amount of the increase in Net
Revenue Interest from that identified on Schedule 2.3 and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest identified on Schedule 2.3; provided,
however, that if the Title Benefit does not affect the applicable Title
Benefit Property throughout its entire life, the Title Benefit Amount shall be
reduced to take into account the applicable time period only; provided
further, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any individual Title
Benefit for which the Title Benefit Amount does not exceed the Individual
Defect Deductible (as defined below), and (ii) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Title Benefits unless the sum of the
aggregate amount of all Title Benefit Amounts that exceed the Individual
Defect Deductible, exceeds the Defect Deductible (as defined below), after
which point Seller shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other available remedies under this Article 3 with respect to all Title
Benefits in excess of the Individual Defect Deductible.

(h) With respect to Title Defect Notices and Title Benefit Notices provided
and received on or before the Title Claim Date, Seller and Purchaser shall
attempt to agree on all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts on or before the day before the Closing Date,
subject to Seller's rights under Section 3.4(d)(ii). If Seller and Purchaser
are unable to agree by that date, then subject to Section 3.4(c) and Seller's
rights under Section 3.4(d)(ii), Seller's good faith estimate shall be used
for purposes of calculating the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 9.4(a),
and the Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit
Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration
pursuant to this Section 3.4(h). Likewise, if Seller has provided notice at or
prior to the Closing Date of Seller's intent to attempt to cure a Title Defect
and by the end of the Cure Period, Seller and Purchaser have been unable to
agree upon whether such Title Defect has been cured, or Seller has failed to
cure any Title Defects which it provided notice that it would attempt to cure
and Seller and Purchaser have been unable to agree on the Title Defect Amounts
for such Title Defects, then the cure and/or Title Defect Amounts and Title
Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.4(h), subject to Seller's right under
Section 3.4(d)(ii). There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title
attorney with at least ten 

(10) years' experience in oil and gas titles in the State of where the
majority (as calculated based upon the Allocated Values of the Properties) of
the affected Properties are located (as calculated based upon the Allocated
Values of the Properties) as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and
Seller within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Cure Period (or such
other time as mutually agreed) and absent such agreement on the selection of
the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected by the Dallas, Texas office
of the American Arbitration Association; provided, however, that in any case
such attorney shall not have worked as an employee of or outside counsel for
either Seller or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates during the 5-year period
preceding the applicable arbitration or have any financial interest in the
applicable dispute (such attorney, the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,
to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The
Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both
parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Sections 3.4(a), 3.4(b),
3.4(c), 3.4(d), 3.4(e), 3.4(f), 3.4(g) and 3.4(i) and may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to
make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator,
including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defects, Title
Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either
party hereto and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either party
hereto with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each party hereto shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (y) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does
not exceed Fifty-five Thousand Dollars ($55,000) (the "Individual Defect
Deductible"); and (z) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for Title Defects unless
the sum of (I) the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts for Title
Defects covered by Section 3.4(d)(i) that exceed the Individual Defect
Deductible, plus (II) the aggregate amount of all Environmental Liabilities
covered by Section 4.4(a) that exceed the Individual Defect Deductible,
exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Purchase
Price (the "Defect Deductible"), after which point Purchaser shall be entitled
to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other available remedies under this
Article 3 with respect to all Title Defects in excess of the Defect
Deductible, subject to the Individual Defect Deductible and Seller's elections
under Section 3.4(d). The provisions of this Section 3.4(i) shall not apply to
Title Defects relating to consent to assignment and preferential rights to
purchase which shall be handled or treated under Section 3.5. The Allocated
Value of any Property retained by Seller in accordance with Section 3.4(d)(ii)
may not be used in meeting the Defect Deductible.

Section 3.5 Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase. 

Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and send
(i) notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment of any
Assets to request such consents and (ii) notices to the holders of any
applicable preferential rights to purchase any Asset requesting waivers of
such preferential rights to purchase, in each case of which Seller has
knowledge. The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular
Assets for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the
Allocated Value for such Assets. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such consents and waivers of preferential rights to purchase
(or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing.
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents to
assignment and waivers of preferential rights. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no liability for failure
to obtain such notices.

(a) Consents. Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing at least five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing of all required third-party consents to the
assignment of the Assets to Purchaser which have not been obtained and the
Assets to which they pertain. In no event shall there be included in the
Conveyances at Closing any Asset subject to a consent requirement that
provides that transfer of the Asset without consent will result in a
termination or other material impairment of any rights in relation to such
Asset (such consent, a "Required Consent"). In cases where the Asset subject
to such a Required Consent is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the
Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred
to Purchaser due to the unwaived consent requirement, Seller shall continue
after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent so
that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of such
consent. In cases where the Asset subject to such a Required Consent is a
Property and the third-party consent to the sale and transfer of the Property
is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may elect to treat the
unsatisfied Required Consent as a Title Defect by giving Seller notice thereof
in accordance with Section 3.4(a), except that such notice must be given at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
the Allocated Value for such Property may not be used in meeting the Defect
Deductible, and Seller may elect to cure such unsatisfied consent under
Section 3.4(c), in which event the provisions of Section 3.4(c) shall apply
(provided the affected Asset shall be excluded from the Assets for purposes of
Closing (unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser)). If an unsatisfied
Required Consent with respect to which a Purchase Price adjustment is made
under Section 3.4 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 9.4(b), Seller shall receive an
additional upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in the final adjustments
made under Section 9.4(b) equal to the amount of the previous reduction in the
Purchase Price on account of such Required Consent and the provisions of this
Section 3.5 shall no longer apply except for the assignment made under the
next sentence. Within two days of the date on which the final statement of the
Adjusted Purchase Price is finally determined, whether by agreement between
Seller and Purchaser or the determination of an Independent Expert under
Section 9.4(b) (or both), Seller shall assign to Purchaser using the form
attached as Exhibit B, to the extent previously unassigned, each Property
subject to a Required Consent that was subsequently satisfied prior to the
date of the final adjustment of the Purchase Price under Section 9.4(b). 

(b) Exercised Preferential Rights to Purchase. If any preferential right to
purchase any Property is exercised prior to Closing, the Property transferred
to a third party as a result of the exercise of such preferential right shall
be treated as if it was subject to a Title Defect resulting in the complete
loss of title and the Purchase Price shall be reduced under Section 2.2(b) by
the Allocated Value for such Property (proportionately reduced if the
preferential right affects only a portion of such Property). Seller shall
retain the consideration paid by the third party pursuant to the exercise of
such preferential right; provided, however, the adjustment made under this
Section 3.5(b) for such Property may not be used in meeting the Defect
Deductible.

Section 3.6 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 8.1(e) and 8.2(e), if, after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is
destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right
of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of such individual casualty or
taking exceeds Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000), Seller shall elect by
written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets
affected by any casualty to be repaired or restored prior to Closing to at
least its condition prior to such casualty, at Seller's sole cost (without an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 or otherwise), as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date), or (ii) unless such casualty or taking is waived by Purchaser, to
exclude the affected Property from the Assets and reduce the Purchase Price by
the Allocated Value thereof; provided, however, that any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.6 may not be used in meeting the
Defect Deductible. In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance
and other claims against third parties with respect to the casualty or taking
except to the extent the parties otherwise agree in writing.

Section 3.7 Limitations on Applicability.

The rights of Purchaser under Section 3.1(a) and Section 3.4(a) shall
terminate as of the Title Claim Date and be of no further force and effect
thereafter, provided there shall be no termination of Purchaser's or Seller's
rights under Section 3.4 with respect to any bona fide Title Defect properly
reported in a Title Defect Notice or bona fide Title Benefit properly reported
in a Title Benefit Notice on or before the Title Claim Date. Except as
provided in this Article 3 and for the Special Warranty in the Conveyance
(subject to Section 7.9), Purchaser releases, remises and forever discharges
the Seller Indemnitees from any and all suits, legal or administrative
proceedings, claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, interest or
causes of action whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which
Purchaser might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising
out of, any Title Defect or other deficiency in or encumbrance on title to any
Asset.

ARTICLE 4 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 4.1 Assessment. 

Subject to the limitations set forth herein and in Section 7.1, Purchaser may,
at its option, cause, or cause to be conducted by a reputable environmental
consulting or engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (the
"Environmental Consultant") an environmental assessment of all or any portion
of the Assets and/or visual inspections, record reviews, and interviews
relating to the Properties, including their condition and their compliance
with Environmental Laws (the "Assessment"). The Assessment shall be conducted
at the sole risk, cost and expense of Purchaser, and all of Purchaser's and
the Environmental Consultant's activity conducted under this Section 4.1 and
Section 7.1 shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of Section 7.6.
Purchaser's right of access shall not entitle Purchaser or the Environmental
Consultant to operate equipment or conduct testing or sampling. Seller has the
right to be present during any activities conducted on the Assets as part of
the Assessment. Purchaser shall coordinate its Assessment with Seller to
minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by
Seller. Purchaser shall abide by Seller's, and any third party operator's,
safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets including the Assessment. Purchaser shall
promptly provide, but not later than the Environmental Claim Date, copies of
all reports, results, and other documentation and data prepared or compiled by
Purchaser and/or any of its representatives or agents in connection with the
Assessment. Seller shall not be deemed by its receipt of said documents or
otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied or
statutory, as to the condition of the Assets or the accuracy of said documents
or the information contained therein. During all periods that Purchaser or any
of its representatives are on the Assets, Purchaser shall maintain, at its
sole expense and with reputable insurers, such insurance as is reasonably
sufficient to support Purchaser's indemnity obligations under Section 7.6.

Section 4.2 NORM.

Purchaser acknowledges the following:

(a) The Assets have been used for exploration, development, and production of
oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other
materials located on or under the Properties or associated with the Assets.

(b) Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, hazardous
substances, or NORM.

(c) NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms.

(d) The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included
in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or hazardous substances.

(e) NORM containing material and other wastes or hazardous substances may have
come in contact with the soil. 

(f) Special procedures may be required for the remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of soil, wastes, asbestos, hazardous substances,
and NORM from the Assets.

Section 4.3 Notice of Violations of Environmental Laws.

Purchaser shall deliver any claim notices to Seller in writing (an
"Environmental Defect Notice"), on or before thirty (30) days from the date
hereof (the "Environmental Claim Date"), of each individual environmental
matter disclosed by the Assessment that Purchaser reasonably believes in good
faith may constitute or result in (including with notice or solely with the
passage of time) Environmental Liabilities for which the Lowest Cost Response
to address the matter exceeds the Individual Defect Deductible, including in
the Environmental Defect Notice (i) a reasonably detailed description of the
specific matter that is an alleged violation of Environmental Laws, including
(A) the written conclusion of Purchaser or Purchaser's Environmental
Consultant that Environmental Liabilities exist, which conclusion shall be
reasonably substantiated by the factual data gathered in Purchaser's
Assessment and (B) a separate specific citation of the provisions of
Environmental Laws alleged to be violated and the related facts that
substantiate such violation; (ii) the Units, Wells or associated Assets
affected; (iii) a detailed estimate of the Lowest Cost Response to cure or
eliminate the alleged matter in question; and (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any consultant, inspector or
expert hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the facts alleged in the
Environmental Defect Notice. The failure of an Environmental Defect Notice to
contain the information required by item nos. (i) through (iv) of the prior
sentence on or prior to the Environmental Claim Date shall not render such
notice ineffective if the defect notice is reasonably sufficient to provide
notice to Seller of the existence and general nature of the alleged
Environmental Defect. Purchaser shall furnish Seller, on or before the end of
each calendar week prior to the Environmental Claim Date, Environmental Defect
Notices with respect to any Environmental Defect that any of Purchaser's or
any of its Affiliate's employees, representatives, attorney or other
environmental personnel or contractors, including the Environmental
Consultant, discover or become aware of during the preceding calendar week,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Environmental Claim Date.

Section 4.4 Remedies for Violations of Environmental Laws.

If Seller confirms to its reasonable satisfaction that any individual matter
described in an Environmental Defect Notice delivered pursuant to Section 4.3
may constitute or result in Environmental Liabilities for which the Lowest
Cost Response to address the matter exceeds the Individual Defect Deductible,
then Seller shall, at its sole election, elect to:

(a) reduce the Purchase Price by an amount agreed upon in writing by Purchaser
and Seller as being a reasonable estimate of the cost of curing the matter
described in such Environmental Defect Notice;

(b) retain the Property that is associated with such Environmental Defect
Notice and affected by such matter, in which event the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property; 

(c) perform or cause to be performed prior to Closing, at the sole cost and
expense of Seller, such operations as may be necessary to bring such affected
Property into compliance with the applicable Environmental Law disclosed in
such Environmental Defect Notice;

(d) enter into an agreement with Purchaser whereby Seller will as soon as
reasonably practicable after Closing, at the sole cost and expense of Seller,
perform or cause to be performed such operations as may be necessary to bring
such affected Property into compliance with the applicable Environmental Law
disclosed in such Environmental Defect Notice;

(e) indemnify Purchaser against all Damages resulting from such Environmental
Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form reasonably agreeable to
Seller and Purchaser which shall be assignable by Seller upon a sale or
transfer of the Assets subject to such agreement to a third party; provided,
that, under no circumstances shall Seller's aggregate liability thereunder
exceed the lesser of either the Allocated Value for the Asset made the subject
thereof or the Lowest Cost Response for such Environmental Defect; provided
further, that, in no event shall the sum of the Environmental Liabilities for
all such Properties for which Seller makes an election under this Section
4.4(e) exceed five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price without Purchaser's
prior written consent; or

(f) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10.

In the event that (i) Seller elects to proceed under Section 4.4(a) and
Purchaser and Seller have failed to agree by Closing on the reduction to the
Purchase Price (which agreement Seller and Purchaser shall use good faith
efforts to reach) or (ii) Purchaser and Seller cannot otherwise agree on the
existence, extent or amount of Environmental Liabilities alleged in an
Environmental Defect Notice before Closing, Seller shall then proceed with
respect to such matter under any of Sections 4.4(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) or
submit such dispute to arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.4. In the event
that Seller elects to proceed under Section 4.4(d) and Purchaser and Seller
have failed to agree by Closing on the terms of the agreement contemplated
thereby (which agreement Seller and Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to
reach), Seller shall then proceed with respect to such matter under any of
Sections 4.4(b), (c), (e) or (f) or submit such dispute to arbitration
pursuant to this Section 4.4.

For all matters submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.4, there
shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental consultant with at
least ten (10) years' relevant experience as selected by mutual agreement of
Purchaser and Seller within fifteen (15) days of an election by Seller to
submit such dispute to arbitration. Absent such agreement on the selection of
the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected by the Dallas, Texas office
of the American Arbitration Association (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section. The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be
made within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the
rules set forth in this Article 4 

and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental
Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. In
connection with the determination of a matter submitted to the Environmental
Arbitrator Purchaser may not assert any violation of Environmental Law that is
not specified by Purchaser in the applicable Environmental Claim Notice. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Environmental Defect or the Lowest Cost
Response for such Environmental Defect submitted by Seller and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to either party hereto with respect to any
matter nor may it award Purchaser a greater amount with respect to the
applicable Environmental Defect than the Lowest Cost Response set forth by
Purchaser in the applicable Environmental Claim Notice. Seller and Purchaser
shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.
Each party hereto shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator. If the validity of any Environmental Defect or the
Lowest Cost Response attributable thereto, is not determined prior to Closing
by the Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 4.4, all affected
Properties shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the purchase price
paid by Purchaser at Closing shall not be reduced by virtue of such dispute
and upon final resolution of such dispute the Lowest Cost Response for such
Environmental Defect as determined by the Environmental Arbitrator shall,
subject to the terms of this this Section 4.4, be promptly refunded by Seller
to Purchaser.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there
be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller
for individual Environmental Liabilities for which the Lowest Cost Response to
address same does not exceed the Individual Defect Deductible; and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for Environmental Liabilities unless and until the sum of
(i) the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects covered
by Section 3.4(d)(i) that exceed the Individual Defect Deductible, plus (ii)
the aggregate amount of all Environmental Liabilities covered by Section
4.4(a) that exceed the Individual Defect Deductible, exceeds the Defect
Deductible, after which point Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other available remedies under this Section 4.4 with
respect to Environmental Liabilities in excess of such Defect Deductible,
subject to the Individual Defect Deductible and Seller's elections under this
Section 4.4 and the last sentence of this Section 4.4. The Allocated Value of
any Property (or affected portion thereof) retained by Seller in accordance
with Section 4.4(b) may not be used in meeting the Defect Deductible.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price under this Agreement for Environmental
Liabilities affecting a Property to the extent such Environmental Liabilities
exceed the Allocated Value of the Property.

Section 4.5 Limitations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for the
indemnity provided under Section 11.2(c) as it relates to breaches of the
representation in Section 5.15, this Article 4 is intended to be the sole and
exclusive remedy that Purchaser Indemnitees shall have against Seller
Indemnitees with respect to any matter or circumstance relating to
Environmental Laws, the release of materials into the environment or
protection of the environment or health. 

Except to the limited extent necessary to enforce the terms of this Article 4
and the indemnity provided under Section 11.2(c) as it relates to breaches of
the representation in Section 5.15, Purchaser (on behalf of itself, each of
the other Purchaser Indemnitees and their respective insurers and successors
in interest) hereby releases and discharges any and all claims and remedies at
Law or in equity, known or unknown, whether now existing or arising in the
future, contingent or otherwise, against the Seller Indemnitees with respect
to any matter or circumstance relating to Environmental Laws, Environmental
Liabilities, the release or threatened release of materials into the
environment or protection of the environment, natural resources, threatened or
endangered species, or health EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT,
EXCLUDING WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER
INDEMNITEES. Except as expressly provided in Section 5.15, Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller has not made and will not make any representation or
warranty regarding any matter or circumstance relating to Environmental Laws,
Environmental Liabilities, the release or threatened release of materials into
the environment or protection of the environment, natural resources,
threatened or endangered species, or health, and that nothing in Article 5 or
otherwise shall be construed as such a representation or warranty.

is limited to matters within the actual knowledge of the persons set forth on
Exhibit C. "Actual knowledge" for purposes of this Agreement means information
actually personally known.

respect to the Assets); (ii) any agreement or contract for the sale,

material payment on not more than ninety (90) days prior written notice; (iii)
any agreement of or binding upon Seller to sell, lease, farmout, or otherwise
dispose of any interest in any of the Assets after the Effective Time, other

surrender or release of any of the Assets, (iv) joint operating agreements,
area of mutual interest agreements and farmout and farmin agreements, and (v)

to assignment, which are applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for (x) consents and approvals by Governmental Bodies of
assignments that are customarily obtained after Closing, (y) preferential

elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller makes no, and disclaims any,
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the presence
or absence of NORM, asbestos, mercury, drilling fluids and chemicals, and
produced waters and Hydrocarbons in or on the Properties or Equipment. The

Material Adverse Effect, with respect to Seller's ownership and operation of
the Assets, to the knowledge of Seller, Seller (a) has paid in all material
respects all royalties and expenses due with respect to Seller's interests in
the Properties as would a reasonably prudent owner, or (b) if not paid, is

ARTICLE 7 

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

Section 7.1 Access. 

Between the date of execution of this Agreement and continuing until the
Closing Date, Seller will give Purchaser and its representatives access to
Seller's offices and the Records, including the right to copy, at Purchaser's
expense, the Records in Seller's possession, for the purpose of conducting an
investigation of the Assets, but only to the extent that Seller may do so
without violating any applicable Law or obligations to any third party and to
the extent that Seller has authority to grant such access without breaching
any restriction binding on Seller. Such access by Purchaser shall be subject
to applicable limitations in Section 4.1 and shall be limited to Seller's
normal business hours, and any weekends and after hours requested by Purchaser
that can be reasonably accommodated by Seller, and Purchaser's investigation
shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation
of the Assets. All information obtained by and access granted to Purchaser and
its representatives under this Section shall be subject to the terms of
Section 7.6 and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.2 Government Reviews.

Seller and Purchaser shall in a timely manner (a) make all required filings,
if any, with and prepare applications to and conduct negotiations with, each
governmental agency as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are
necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (b) provide such information as each may reasonably request to
make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations.
Each party shall cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the other with respect to such filings, applications and negotiations.

Section 7.3 Notification of Breaches.

Until the Closing,

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that (i) any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect or (ii) any representation or
warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement is untrue in any material
respect or will be untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or
any covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or
on the Closing Date has not been so performed or observed in a material
respect.

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that (i) any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any
material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to
be performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in a material respect or (ii) any representation
or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement is untrue in any material
respect or will be untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date or
that any covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by Seller prior to
or on the Closing Date has not been so performed or observed in any material
respect. 

If any of Purchaser's or Seller's representations or warranties is untrue or
shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchaser's or Seller's
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date (other than on a specified date) shall not have been so performed or
observed in any material respect, but if such breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be cured by the Closing
(or, if the Closing does not occur, by the date set forth in Section 10.1),
then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of
this Agreement.

Section 7.4 Operatorship.

Seller will assist Purchaser in its efforts to succeed Seller as operator of
any Wells included in the Seller Operated Assets. Seller makes no
representation and does not warrant or guarantee that Purchaser will succeed
in being appointed successor operator. Purchaser shall promptly, following
Closing, file and diligently pursue until receipt of any acknowledgement,
consent or confirmation by applicable agencies all appropriate forms, permit
transfers and declarations or bonds with federal and state agencies relative
to its assumption of operatorship. For all Seller Operated Assets, with
respect to which Purchaser receives the necessary approvals to succeed Seller
as operator, Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser, on forms to be
prepared by Purchaser and acceptable to Seller, and Purchaser shall promptly
file, the applicable forms transferring operatorship of such Seller Operated
Assets to Purchaser.

Section 7.5 Operation of Business.

Except as set forth on Schedule 7.5 or for expenditures or operations set
forth on Schedule 5.9, and except as otherwise consented to in writing by
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, until
the Closing, Seller (i) will operate its business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practices, (ii) will not commit to any single operation,
or series of related operations, reasonably anticipated by Seller to require
future capital expenditures by the owner of the Assets in excess of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (net to Seller's interest) or make any
capital expenditures related to the Assets in excess of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) (net to Seller's interest), (iii) will not terminate,
materially amend, execute or extend any material agreements affecting the
Assets, (iv) will maintain insurance coverage on the Assets presently
furnished by nonaffiliated third parties in the amounts and of the types
presently in force, (v) will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all Leases, (vi) will maintain all material
Governmental Authorizations affecting the Assets, (vii) will not transfer,
farmout, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any material
Assets except for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbon production and
Equipment made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, (viii) will not become a non-consenting party in any operation
proposed by any other Person with respect to the Assets unless requested to do
so in writing by Purchaser and (ix) will not commit to do any of the
foregoing. Purchaser's approval of any action restricted by this Section 7.5
shall be considered granted within five (5) days (unless a shorter time is
reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in
Seller's written notice) of Seller's notice to Purchaser requesting such
consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary during that 

period. In the event of an emergency, Seller may take such action as a prudent
operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly
thereafter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall have
no liability to Purchaser for the incorrect payment of delay rentals,
royalties, overriding royalties, shut-in payment payments or similar payments
made during the Adjustment Period or for failure to make such payments through
mistake or oversight (including Seller's negligence or other fault), except
that, to the extent such incorrect payment causes Seller to have less than
Defensible Title to a Property prior to Closing, Purchaser may, until the
Title Claim Date, assert a Title Defect under Section 3.4(a) with respect to
such matter and except to the extent such incorrect payment gives rise to an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, at Closing (and as a post-Closing adjustment
on the statement delivered by Seller in accordance with Section 9.4(b), if
applicable) but then only to the extent of such adjustment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to any Asset for which Seller is not the operator, Seller shall not be
deemed to have breached or otherwise violated any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement that are applicable to any such Assets
so long as Seller exercise reasonable commercial efforts to cause any third
party operator of such Assets to comply with such covenant or agreement.

Purchaser acknowledges that Seller may own an undivided interest in certain of
the Assets and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the other
working interest owners who are not affiliated with Seller shall not
constitute a violation of the provisions of this Article 7 nor shall any
action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a
violation so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner consistent with
the provisions of this Article 7.

Section 7.6 Indemnity Regarding Access.

Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the Purchaser Indemnitees, hereby releases
and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller Indemnitees and the
other owners of interests in the Leases and Wells described on Exhibit A or
Exhibit A-1 from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs
and expenses (including court costs, expert fees and reasonable attorneys'
fees), including claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses attributable
to personal injuries, death, or property damage, arising out of or relating to
access to the Assets by the Purchaser Indemnitees, the Records and other
related activities or information prior to the Closing by Purchaser
Indemnitees, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PERSON EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, ANY CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS
OR EXPENSES CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

Section 7.7 Other Preferential Rights.

Should a third party fail to exercise its preferential right to purchase as to
any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver
has not yet expired, subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 7.7,
such Assets shall be included in the transaction at Closing, 

such preferential right to purchase shall be a Permitted Encumbrance
hereunder, and the following procedures shall be applicable. If one or more of
the holders of any such preferential right to purchase notifies Seller
subsequent to the Closing that it intends to assert its preferential purchase
right, Seller shall give notice thereof to Purchaser, whereupon Purchaser
shall satisfy all such preferential purchaser right obligations of Seller to
such holders and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including
court costs, expert fees and reasonable attorney's fees) in connection
therewith, and Purchaser shall be entitled to receive (and Seller hereby
assigns to Purchaser all of Seller's rights to) all proceeds, received from
such holders in connection with such preferential rights to purchase.

Prior to Closing, should any third party bring any suit, action or other
proceeding seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce
preferential rights, the Assets subject to such suit, action or other
proceeding shall be excluded from the Assets transferred at Closing and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded
Assets. Promptly after the suit, action or other proceeding is dismissed or
settled or a judgment is rendered in favor of Seller, as applicable, Seller
shall sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, all such
Assets not being sold to the third party for a purchase price equal to the
Allocated Value of such Assets, adjusted as provided in Section 2.2.

Section 7.8 Tax Matters.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 12.3, Seller shall be responsible for
all Taxes related to the ownership or operation of the Assets that are
attributable to any taxable period, or portion thereof, that ends at or prior
to the Effective Time. Purchaser shall be responsible for all other Taxes
related to the ownership or operation of the Assets. Regardless of which party
is responsible for Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentences of this Section
7.8(a), Seller shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of
all Taxes related to the ownership or operation of the Assets which are
required to be paid prior to Closing (and shall file all Tax Returns with
respect to such Taxes); provided that to the extent such Taxes relate to the
periods from and after the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to Section
1.4(c), such payment shall be on behalf of Purchaser, and promptly following
the Closing Date, following Seller's request, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
any such Taxes (but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been
accounted for under Section 2.2). Purchaser shall handle payment to the
appropriate Governmental Body of all Taxes related to the ownership or
operation of the Assets which are required to be paid after Closing (and shall
file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes); provided that that in the
event that Seller is required by applicable Law to file a Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes after the Closing Date which includes all or a portion
of a Tax period for which Purchaser is liable for such Taxes, following
Seller's request, Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller all such Taxes
allocable to the period or portion thereof beginning at or after the Effective
Time (but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been accounted
for under Section 2.2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.8(a)
shall not apply to income, franchise, corporate, business and occupation,
business license and similar Taxes (including Taxes based on net profits,
margin, revenues, gross receipts or similar measure), and Tax Returns 

therefor, which shall be borne, paid and filed by the party responsible for
such Taxes under applicable Law. If requested by Purchaser, Seller will assist
Purchaser with preparation of all ad valorem and property Tax Returns due on
or before thirty (30) days after Closing (including any extensions requested).
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of filing copies of
all Tax Returns filed by Seller after the Closing Date relating to the Assets
and any supporting documentation provided by Seller to Governmental Bodies.

(b) If Seller or Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser) receives a
refund of any Taxes (whether by payment, credit offset or otherwise, with any
interest thereon) covered by Section 7.8(a) that are paid by and required to
be borne by the other party hereto, the party that received (or whose
Affiliate that received) such refund shall promptly (but no later than thirty
(30) days after receipt) remit payment to such other party of an amount equal
to the refund amount, with any interest thereon, including all relevant
documentation. Each party hereto shall cooperate with the other and its
Affiliates in order to take all reasonably necessary steps to claim any refund
to which it is entitled. Purchaser agrees to notify Seller within ten (10)
days following the discovery of a right to claim any refund to which Seller is
entitled and upon receipt of any such refund.

(c) Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, Purchaser shall not and
shall not permit its Affiliates to amend any Tax Return with respect to Taxes
for which Seller is liable under this Section 7.8 or for which Seller may be
liable to indemnify Purchaser under Section 11.2. Any Tax Return prepared by
Purchaser for a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning before the
Effective Time shall be prepared in accordance with Seller's prior practice
and shall not be filed without Seller's written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) after providing Seller a copy
thereof reasonably in advance of the due date for filing such Tax Returns. In
the event that Seller is required by applicable Law to file any Tax Return
with respect to Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible hereunder, Seller
shall prepare and timely file such Tax Return but shall not file such Tax
Return without Purchaser's written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) after providing Purchaser a copy thereof reasonably in
advance of the due date for filing such Tax Return. If Seller or Purchaser
disputes any item on a Tax Return described in this Section 7.8(c), it shall
notify the other Party of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its
objection. The Parties shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute
prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed.
Purchaser and Seller shall each provide the other with all information
reasonably necessary to prepare any Tax Return described in this Section
7.8(c).

(d) After the Closing, Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall notify the
other party in writing within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the notice
of any proposed assessment or commencement of any Tax audit or administrative
or judicial proceeding and of any Tax demand or claim on Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or Seller or any of its Affiliates that, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could reasonably be
grounds for indemnification by Seller or would be reasonably likely to
materially increase the Tax liability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates;
provided that failure to timely provide such notice shall not affect the right
of Purchaser's indemnification 

hereunder, except to the extent Seller is prejudiced by such delay or
omission. Such notice shall contain factual information describing the
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Governmental Body in respect of any
such asserted Tax liability. Seller shall control any proceeding with respect
to any Taxes or Tax Returns relating to or with respect to any Asset ("Tax
Audit") for any item relating to a Tax for which Seller is reasonably likely
to be responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to Section 7.8(a) or for
which Seller may be liable to indemnify Purchaser under Section 11.2. Neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall settle any such Tax Audit in a way that would
adversely affect the other party without the other party's written consent,
which consent the other party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or
condition. Purchaser and Seller shall each provide the other with all
information reasonably necessary to conduct a Tax Audit with respect to Taxes
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) If, prior to Closing, Seller has paid on behalf of other working interest
owners, royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other
interest owners in the Assets, ad valorem, property, severance, production and
similar Taxes imposed on the ownership of the Assets or the production of
Hydrocarbons produced from such Assets for Tax periods or portions thereof
after the Effective Time (such amounts, "Post-Effective Time Tax Advances")
and has not recouped such Post-Effective Time Tax Advances before the Closing
Date from such working interest owners, royalty interest owners, overriding
royalty interest owners and other interest owners in the Assets, Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recoup the Post-Effective
Time Tax Advances from such other working interest owners, royalty interest
owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other interest owners in such
Assets and shall promptly remit any such recovered Post-Effective Time Tax
Advance amounts to Seller.

(f) Notwithstanding Section 12.11, Purchaser and Seller hereby agree that any
party, at its sole expense, may elect a like-kind exchange under Section 1031
of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller, at its expense, shall have the right at any time prior to the Closing
to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a "qualified
intermediary" (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an "exchange accommodation titleholder" (as that
term is defined in Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308) in order to
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby at such Closing in a manner
that will qualify, either in whole or in part, as a like-kind exchange under
Section 1031 of the Code. Likewise, Purchaser, at its expense, shall have the
right at any time prior to the Closing to assign all or a portion of its
rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary or an exchange
accommodation titleholder for the same purpose. In the event that any party
assigns its rights under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.8(f), such
party agrees to notify the other party in writing of such assignment on or
before the Closing attributable to such rights. Purchaser and Seller agree to
cooperate to the extent reasonably requested by the other party in order to
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby as a like-kind exchange under
Section 1031 of the Code; provided that (a) the Closing shall not be delayed
or affected by reason of the like-kind exchange; (b) Seller shall indemnify
Purchaser against any additional costs, damages or liabilities directly
incurred by Purchaser on account of Seller's 

consummation of the transaction through a like-kind exchange; and (c)
Purchaser shall indemnify Seller against any additional costs, damages or
liabilities directly incurred by Seller on account of Purchaser's consummation
of the transaction through a like-kind exchange. Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that any assignment of rights under this Agreement to a
qualified intermediary or an exchange accommodation titleholder shall not
release any party from, or modify, any of its obligations to the other party
under this Agreement and that no party represents to any other party that any
particular Tax treatment will be given to any party as a result thereof. In no
event will any party be liable to any other party for any failure of any
transaction to qualify for like-kind treatment under Section 1031 of the Code.

Section 7.9 Special Warranty of Title.

The Conveyance shall contain a covenant of Seller to warrant Defensible Title
to the Leases, Wells and Units after Closing from and against the lawful
claims of third parties arising by, through or under Seller, but not
otherwise, that are not reflected or referred to of record in the counties
where the lands covered by the Leases and Units are located or in the
materials made available to Purchaser prior to the Title Claim Date (the
"Special Warranty"); provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser Indemnitees for
any Damages resulting from a breach of such covenant unless (A) the sum of (x)
Damages resulting from such breach plus (y) Title Defect Amounts for Title
Defects covered by Section 3.4(d)(i) plus (z) Environmental Liabilities
covered by Section 4.4(a), exceeds the Defect Deductible, after which point
Seller shall be liable for such Damages in excess of the Defect Deductible and
(B) Purchaser delivers notice to Seller of such claim on or before the date
that is the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) without limiting
clause (i), Seller's liability to Purchaser in respect of such covenant for
any Lease, Well or Unit shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Lease,
Well or Unit. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be entitled
to claim a breach of the Special Warranty for any Title Defect claimed in a
Title Defect Notice or of which Purchaser had knowledge on or before the Title
Claim Date.

Section 7.10 Suspended Proceeds.

Seller shall transfer and remit to Purchaser, in the form of an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, at Closing (and as a post-Closing adjustment on the
statement delivered by Seller in accordance with Section 9.4(b), if
applicable), all monies representing the value or proceeds of production
removed or sold from the Properties and held by Seller at the time of the
Closing for accounts from which payment has been suspended, such monies, net
of applicable rights of set off or recoupment, being hereinafter called
"Suspended Proceeds". Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the proper
distribution of such Suspended Proceeds to the Person or Persons which or who
are entitled to receive payment of the same.

Section 7.11 Further Assurances.

After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to take such further actions
and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are
reasonably requested by the other party 

hereto for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document

shall be selected by any Federal District Court Judge or State District Court

any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Independent Expert shall not
increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either party
hereto and may not award damages or penalties to either party hereto with
respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees
and other costs of presenting its case. Each party hereto shall bear one-half
of the costs and expenses of the Independent Expert. Within ten (10) days

ARTICLE 10 

TERMINATION

Section 10.1 Termination.

Subject to Section 10.2, this Agreement shall be terminated: (i) at any time
prior to Closing by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser;
(ii) by Seller or Purchaser if Closing has not occurred on or before the date
that is sixty (60) days from the date hereof (or in the event such date is not
a Business Day then the next Business Day immediately following such date)
(the "Termination Date"); (iii) by Purchaser if any condition set forth in
Section 8.2 has not been satisfied or waived at Closing or (iv) by Seller if
any condition set forth in Section 8.1 has not been satisfied or waived at
Closing; provided, however, that termination under clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv)
shall not be effective until the party electing to terminate has delivered
written notice to the other 

party of its election to so terminate and provided, however, that no Party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (ii),
(iii) or (iv) above, if such Party or its Affiliates are at such time in
material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, except as set forth
in this Section 10.2 and in Section 10.3, this Agreement shall become void and
of no further force or effect (except for the provisions of Sections 5.6, 6.5,
7.6, 11.6, 12.2, 12.4, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10 12.11, 12.12, 12.13, 12.14,
12.15, 12.16, 12.17, 12.18, and 12.19 and of the Confidentiality Agreement
which shall continue in full force and effect) and Seller shall be free
immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell,
transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without
any restriction under this Agreement. Subject to Section 10.3, the termination
of this Agreement under Section 10.1(ii), (iii) or (iv) shall not relieve any
party hereto from liability to the other party at Law or in equity for any
failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior
to Closing.

Section 10.3 Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(ii) or
Section 10.1(iv) and Seller has performed or is ready, willing and able to
perform all of its agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be
performed or observed at or prior to Closing, then Seller shall retain the
Deposit as liquidated damages as Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach or failure to perform by Purchaser under this Agreement, and all other
remedies (except those under Section 7.6 and the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by
Seller. In the event that prior to such termination Purchaser has engaged in
any hedging transactions related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and entered into on or around the date hereof (including any swaps,
puts or similar hedging agreements), then to the extent that at the time of
such termination set forth in the first sentence above, such hedging
transactions either represent a positive gain in favor of Purchaser or its
Affiliate or give rise to an obligation of the other party to such hedging
agreement to make a payment to Purchaser or its Affiliate, Purchaser shall pay
to Seller, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the greater of
such positive gain or payment (which amount shall be in addition to the
Deposit). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the retention of the Deposit and other remedies provided in this
Section 10.3(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller for
Purchaser's breach of this Agreement or failure or refusal to close, and
Seller expressly waives any and all other remedies, legal and equitable, that
it otherwise may have had for Purchaser's breach of this Agreement or failure
or refusal to close. Seller and Purchaser agree that the retention of the
Deposit constitutes liquidated damages due to the difficulty and inconvenience
of measuring actual damages and the uncertainty thereof, and Seller and
Purchaser agree that such amount would be a reasonable estimate of Seller's
loss in the event of any such breach or failure to perform by Purchaser. Upon
such termination, Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights 

of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise
dispose of the Assets to any Person without any restriction under this
Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Sections 10.1(ii)
or 10.1(iii) and Purchaser has performed or is ready, willing and able to
perform all of its agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be
performed or observed at or prior to Closing, then at Purchaser's option:

(i) Seller shall return the Deposit to Purchaser and Purchaser shall be
entitled to seek money damages from Seller available at Law for Seller's
applicable breach of this Agreement, as Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy
for any breach or failure to perform by Seller under this Agreement, and all
other remedies (except those under the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect) are hereby expressly waived by Purchaser, and
Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the
Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to
any Person without any restriction under this Agreement; or

(ii) in lieu of termination of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to
specific performance of this Agreement, it being specifically agreed that
monetary damages will not be sufficient to compensate Purchaser if Purchaser
determines the same in its sole discretion. If Purchaser elects to seek
specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.3(b)(ii),
the Deposit shall be held by Seller, until a non-appealable final judgment or
award on Purchaser's claim for specific performance is rendered, at which time
the Deposit shall be distributed as provided in the judgment or award
resolving the specific performance claim or shall be applied as provided in
Section 2.4 of this Agreement.

(c) If this Agreement terminates for reasons other than those set forth in
Section 10.3(a) or Section 10.3(b), Seller shall deliver the Deposit to
Purchaser, free of any claims by Seller or any other Person with respect
thereto, and each party hereto shall have no further liability hereunder of
any nature whatsoever to the other party hereto, including any liability for
Damages (except for the provisions of Sections 5.6, 6.5, 7.6 and 12.4 and the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms), and Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy
all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or
otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without any restriction under
this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not be entitled to receive interest on the Deposit, regardless of
whether the Deposit is applied against the Purchase Price or returned to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 10.3.

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER

INDEMNITEES OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, ANY DAMAGES CAUSED

indemnification is based upon a claim by a third party against the Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third
Party 

Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to
give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 11.2 except to
the extent such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement which was inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have fourteen (14) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such fourteen (14)-day period, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party all costs of which shall be included as
Damages in respect of such claim for indemnification. The failure to provide
notice to the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be acceptance of liability.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate, at the
sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, at its sole cost without any right of
reimbursement, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 11.3(d). Irrespective of
whether the Indemnified Party elects to participate in contesting a Third
Party Claim subject to this Section 11.3(d) in accordance with the foregoing
sentence, the Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and expense shall provide to
the Indemnified Party the following information with respect to the Third
Party Claim: all filings made by any party; all written communications
exchanged between any parties; and all orders, opinions, rulings or motions.
The Indemnifying Party shall deliver the foregoing items to the Indemnified
Party promptly after they become available to the Indemnifying Party. An
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i)
settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or
(ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages paid by the
Indemnifying Party or covered fully by the indemnity). 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability for a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the
option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in
writing its liability for the Third Party Claim and (ii) if liability is so
admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement. If
Indemnifying Party fails to respond and admit in writing its liability during
such ten (10) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
approved such proposed settlement.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure or remedy the Damages complained of, (ii) admit
its liability for such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
30-day period that it has cured or remedied the Damages or that it disputes
the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
disputed the claim for such Damages.

herein shall survive until the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days
counted from and after the Closing Date (including such one hundred eightieth
(180th) day) and expire thereafter, except for the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 and 5.8 which shall

and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement to be performed on or before Closing
shall expire on the day following the Closing Date and each other covenant and

agreements contained in the certificate delivered by each party hereto at
Closing pursuant to Sections 9.2(g) and 9.3(f), as applicable, shall survive
the Closing as to each representation, warranty covenant and agreement so
affirmed for the same period of time that the specific representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this Section
11.4, and shall expire thereafter. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall terminate and be of no further force and effect after the
respective date of their expiration, after which time no claim may be asserted
thereunder by any Person, provided that there shall be no termination of any
bona fide claim asserted pursuant to Section 11.4(c).

(b) The indemnities in Sections 11.2(b)(ii), 11.2(b)(iii), 11.2(c)(i) and
11.2(c)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective
representation, warranty, 

covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case
as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or before such termination date.
Purchaser's indemnities in Sections 7.6, 11.2(b)(i), and 11.2(b)(iv) shall
continue without time limit. The indemnities in Section 11.2(c) shall
terminate as set forth therein or on the dates set forth below, to the extent
applicable.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, except for claims for breaches of the Special Warranty and any
payments in respect thereof:

(i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
11.2(c)(ii) for any individual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or
judgment that does not exceed Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000), except
for Damages directly arising from claims for breaches of Sections 5.2, 5.3,
5.4, 5.6 or 5.8;

(ii) Subject to Section 11.4(c)(i), Seller shall not have any liability for
indemnification under Section 11.2(c)(ii) (except for Damages directly arising
from claims for breaches of Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 or 5.8) until and
unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim
Notices are timely delivered by Purchaser exceeds a deductible amount equal to
two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price (the "Indemnity Deductible"), after
which point Purchaser (or Purchaser Indemnitees) shall be entitled to claim
Damages in excess of the Indemnity Deductible; and

(iii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser and Purchaser
Indemnitees for aggregate Damages under Section 11.2(c)(ii) in excess of
fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price, except for Damages directly
arising from claims for breaches of Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 or 5.8.

(iv) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
11.2(c)(ii) unless Seller has received a Claim Notice with respect to such
claim at or prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days counted
from and after the Closing Date (including such one hundred eightieth (180th)
day), except for Claim Notices delivered after such time period relating to
claims for breaches of Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 or 5.8 but only to the
extent relating to breaches of such Sections.

(d) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that after the Closing the payment of
money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate
compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As the
payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Purchaser and Seller waive
any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement,
Purchaser's obligation to indemnify Seller Indemnitees with respect to the
Assumed 

Liabilities shall not extend to any amount actually received by Seller from an
indemnification from a non-Affiliated third party. The amount of any Damages
for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Agreement
shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds realized by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to such Damages. From and
until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify its insurers of any potential claim
for which Purchaser (pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) may be required
to indemnify Seller and with respect to which Seller reasonably believes is
covered by its insurance with such insurer; provided, however, that Seller
shall have no obligations to take any action with its insurers beyond such
notification and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
should Seller for any reason fail to deliver such notice to its insurers, such
failure shall have no impact on Purchaser's obligation to indemnify Seller
which shall in no way be conditioned upon Seller's delivery or failed delivery
of such notice.

Section 11.5 Recording.

As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall record the Conveyances
in the appropriate counties or parishes as well as the appropriate
governmental agencies and provide Seller with copies of all recorded or
approved instruments.

Section 11.6 Waivers.

(a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that Purchaser's rights and
remedies with respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or
practices of Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this
transaction shall be governed by legal principles other than the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, Subchapter E of Chapter 17,
Sections 17.41 et seq., of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, as amended
(the "DTPA") or the Louisiana unfair trade practices and consumer protection
law, La.R.S. 51:1401, et seq. (the "UTPCPL"). As such, Purchaser hereby waives
the applicability of the DTPA and the UTPCPL to this transaction and any and
all duties, rights or remedies that might be imposed by the DTPA or the
UTPCPL, whether such duties, rights and remedies are applied directly by the
DTPA or the UTPCPL themselves or indirectly in connection with other statutes.
Purchaser acknowledges, represents and warrants that it is purchasing the
goods and/or services covered by this Agreement for commercial or business
use; that it has assets of Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or
more according to its most recent financial statement prepared in accordance
with GAAP; that it has knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of a transaction such
as this; and that it is not in a significantly disparate bargaining position
with Seller.

(b) Purchaser expressly recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed
to perform its obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and the UTPCPL and this waiver of the DTPA and the
UTPCPL. Purchaser further recognizes that Seller, in determining to proceed
with the entering into of this Agreement, has expressly relied on this waiver
and the inapplicability of the DTPA and the UTPCPL. 

(c) Purchaser waives all rights in redhibition pursuant to Louisiana Civil
Code 2475 and 2520 through 2548, and acknowledges that this express waiver
shall be considered a material and integral part of this sale and the
consideration thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that this waiver has been
brought to its attention and has been explained in detail and that Purchaser
has voluntarily and knowingly consented to this waiver of warranty of fitness
and warranty against redhibitory vices and defects for the Assets.

(d) To the extent applicable to the Assets or any portion thereof, Purchaser
hereby waives the provisions of the UTPCPL. Purchaser warrants and represents
that it: (i) is experienced and knowledgeable with respect to the oil and gas
industry generally and with transactions of this type specifically; (ii)
possesses ample knowledge, experience and expertise to evaluate independently
the merits and risks of the transactions herein contemplated; and (iii) is not
in a significantly disparate bargaining position.

(e) The parties hereto do not intend that any implied obligation of good faith
or fair dealing requires any party hereto to incur, suffer or perform any act,
condition or obligation contrary to the terms of this Agreement or any
documents delivered in connection herewith and that it would be unfair, and
that they do not intend, to increase any of the obligations of any party under
this Agreement or any documents delivered in connection herewith on the basis
of any such implied obligation.

(f) Purchaser acknowledges that plugging, abandonment, removal and restoration
obligations for the Assets are material and significant. Purchaser
acknowledges that Purchaser has conducted its own investigation and evaluation
as to the cost and timing of such obligations and that, other than the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, Seller has made no
representation or warranty as to the expected cost or timetable for incurring
costs of plugging, abandonment, removal and restoration obligations for the
Assets. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller is entering into this Agreement in
reliance upon Purchaser\'s agreement to assume such obligations and all other
Assumed Obligations and that assumption of the Assumed Obligations constitutes
material agreed consideration to Seller in consideration for the Assets.

Section 11.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.

The parties hereto agree that any payments made by one party to the other
party pursuant to this Article 11 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the purchase price for the Assets unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.
