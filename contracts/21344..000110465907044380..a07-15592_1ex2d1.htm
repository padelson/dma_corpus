Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Agreement or consented thereto in

the Per Share Merger Consideration (determined and paid in accordance with
the terms, provisions and procedures set forth in this Agreement (including

contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration but shall instead be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to applicable Law.  Following the
Closing, the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) shall be required in order for the Company to voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such purchase
demand made by any holder of Dissenting Shares (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
") under applicable Law.  The Company also agrees to give Parent prompt
notice of any written demand for appraisal of any Company Common Stock,

payment of the "fair value" for their shares of Company Common Stock
shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall have
been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If,
after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such Dissenting Stockholders
rights under Section 910 of the NYBCL, then such Persons Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have
been canceled at the Effective Time, and Parent shall issue and deliver, upon
surrender by such stockholder of certificate or certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock, the portion of the Merger Consideration to
which such stockholder would otherwise theretofore have been entitled under
this Agreement.

each of the Key Employees and the Key Employee Escrow Agent. The amount of

_Section 2.9(c)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall each pay
50% of the fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

  

Section 2.10 _Exchange Procedures_.

  

(a) _Exchange Procedures_.  As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Company
Securityholder of stock certificates, options or warrants or other securities
which, immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
Company Securities (other than Company Options) (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (including the accompanying
Substitute Form W-9 or the applicable Form W-8), which shall contain an
affirmation of any previously delivered Stockholder Consent and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent (the " _Transmittal Letter_ "), (ii) in the case of a Company
Securityholder that holds Warrants, a duly executed cancellation
acknowledgement (a " _Cancellation Acknowledgement_ "), substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ and (iii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash, in each
case to the extent the Company has not previously received such documents
duly executed by the applicable Company Securityholder. Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such
Transmittal Letter and Cancellation Acknowledgement, to the extent applicable
(in each case to the extent the Company has not previously received such
documents duly executed by the applicable Company Securityholder), each duly
executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions (collectively, the " _Holder Documents_ "), the Company
Securityholder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive the amount
specified in _Section 2.7(a)_ or _Section 2.7(c)(iii)_ , as applicable, in
exchange therefor, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Company Security,
that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, the proper amount
of cash may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Company Security is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by such
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by
reasonable evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.10(a)_ , each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash to which
such Company Securityholder is entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

  

(b) _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.  Regarding Company Securityholders
that hold Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Participating Common Holder_ "), as
promptly as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of any
Participating Common Holders Certificates and applicable Holder Documents
executed and delivered in accordance with this Agreement, the

       

Exchange Agent shall deliver to such Participating Common Holder the Per
Share Closing Date Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock held
by such Participating Common Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time as determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of _Section
2.7_.

  

(c) _Exchange of Company Options and Warrants_.

  

(i) Regarding Company Securityholders that hold Warrants as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Participating Common Convertible
Holder_ "), as promptly as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of
any Participating Common Convertible Holders Warrants (or written
acknowledgments of the cancellation thereof upon receipt of the applicable
Merger Consideration), as applicable, and applicable Holder Documents
executed and delivered in accordance with this Agreement, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to such Participating Common Convertible Holder, the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Closing Date Merger Consideration over the exercise
price for each Company Warrant held by such Participating Common Convertible
Holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as determined in
accordance with the applicable provision of _Section 2.7_.

  

(ii) The holder of a Company Option shall be entitled to a cash payment in an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Closing Date Merger
Consideration over the exercise price for each Company Option held by such
holder, payable no sooner than the first Business Day after the Closing Date
and, unless otherwise agreed to by Parent, the Company and the holder
thereof, no later than the fifth Business Day after the Closing Date.

  

(iii) Parent, the Company and all Persons related to the Company under
Section 267(b) of the Code agree that any deduction arising with respect to
consideration paid to an Option Holder under _Section 2.7(c)(i)_ shall be
treated as occurring not earlier than the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date and included in determining the consolidated taxable income of
the Parent pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

  

(d) _Full Satisfaction_.  All cash paid in respect of Company Securities in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Securities.

  

(e) _Undistributed Portions of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Securities for nine
(9) months after the Effective Time, and all certificates or other documents
in possession of the Exchange Agent relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be promptly delivered to Parent, and the Exchange Agents
duties shall thereupon terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate
representing Company Securities (other than certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) may surrender such certificate to the
Surviving Corporation and (subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law) receive in consideration therefor, the Merger
Consideration relating thereto, without any interest thereon, calculated in
accordance with _Section 2.7_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Securities as of a date that is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or

       

become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Company Securityholder for any cash delivered to a Governmental Entity or
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(f) _Withholding Taxes_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from Merger Consideration and any
other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law,
provided that (except to the extent resulting from a change in law) such
deduction and withholding shall be limited to (x) withholding under Section
1445 of the Code (but only if the Company fails to satisfy the condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(g)_ ), (y) any so-called "backup withholding" required
as a result of a Person having failed to deliver any Form W-8 or Form W-9
that was required to avoid such backup withholding, and (z) amounts required
to be deducted and withheld in respect of any compensatory Option or Warrant.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall
be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Company Securityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

(g) _Dissenting Shares_.  The provisions of this _Section 2.10_ also shall
apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such as set forth in
_Section 2.7(f)_ , except that the obligations of Parent under this _Section
2.10_  shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the cash
amount which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.7_ and
the Merger Consideration Schedule.

  

Section 2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Securities_. All cash
paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

Section 2.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.7_ and the Merger Consideration Schedule with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such certificates; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance and payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver to Parent an affidavit of loss, theft or
destruction in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the posting by such
owner of a bond, in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Representatives with
respect to Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

       

Section 2.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Assurances_.  At any time
after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall take such further action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent that is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, consummate the Merger, and to vest Parent with control
over, and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to, all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company.

best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done and assist and cooperate with other

       

parties and with each other in order to do all things necessary, proper or
advisable (subject to applicable Law) to consummate and make effective the
Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, as
promptly as practicable, including, without limitation, the preparation and
filing of all documentation to effect all filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents necessary to consummate the Closing and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and the taking of such actions as

limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall promptly after the
date hereof (to the extent not made prior to the date hereof) (i) make or
cause to be made the filings required of such party in order to obtain all
Permits required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, including under the HSR Act and any other

(b) Parent shall take the lead in and control all discussions, negotiations
and other communications with all Governmental Entities in connection with
any such Permits. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable Law,
each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate, and cause its Representatives
to cooperate, with the other and any Governmental Entity in taking all
actions, and furnishing all information, reasonably necessary to obtain any
such Governmental Approval, and shall comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on it with respect to the Closing. In
connection with the actions and procedures referenced in this _Section 5.3_ ,
each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
(i) promptly and fully inform the other of any written or material oral
communication received from or given to any Governmental Entity, (ii) permit
the other to review any submission by the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to any Governmental Entity, (iii) consult with the other in advance of
any meeting, material conference or material discussion with any Governmental
Entity, and (iv) if permitted to do so by the relevant Governmental Entity,
give the other the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings,
conferences and discussions. To the extent that transfers, amendments or
modifications of Permits are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to
effect such transfers, amendments or modifications.

  

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing, the unconditional consent, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the Closing and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, of (i) each Person holding a material mortgage
or lien on material personal property owned or leased by the Company, (ii)
each lessor of material real or material personal property leased by the
Company, (iii) the issuer of each material insurance policy referred to in
the Company Disclosure Schedules and (iv) each party to each Material
Contract with the Company, in each case to the extent required under or in
connection with such mortgage, lien, lease, policy or Material Contract;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be obligated to make any material
payment or concession in connection with the foregoing unless such action is
conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. All such consents shall be in writing and executed
counterparts thereof shall be delivered to Parent at or prior to the Closing.
 The

       

Company shall bear all costs associated with obtaining any of the consents
described in this _Section 5.3(c)_ , it being understood that all such costs
incurred by the Company shall be included in the Company Transaction
Expenses.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
not be required, in order to resolve any objections asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, to (i) agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate
any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or Parents Subsidiaries or
any portion of Parents, the Companys or Parents Subsidiaries assets or
businesses, (ii) agree to, or proffer to, not compete in any geographic area
or line of business, (iii) restrict the manner in which, or whether Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on business in
any geographic area or materially restrict the exercise of the full rights of
ownership, (iv) agree to any terms or conditions that would impose any
material obligations on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the
consummation of the Merger, the Company, to maintain facilities, operations,
places of business, employment levels, products or businesses, or any other
restriction, limitation or qualification, (v) make any payments, or (vi) take
or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation or restriction
that Parent reasonably determines (A) would or would reasonably be likely to
be adverse (other than in an immaterial respect) to Parent, the Company, or
any of Parents Subsidiaries or (B) would or would reasonably be likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, impair (other than in an immaterial
respect) the benefits reasonably expected by Parent to be derived from the
transactions contemplated herby, including the Merger; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent may require the Company to take any such actions
as they relate to the Company, if such action is conditioned on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and
Parent shall give written notice to the other promptly (and in any event not
more than two (2) Business Days) after becoming aware of the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would
be likely to cause any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be unsatisfied
at the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to furnish Parent within fifteen (15) days following the end of each
calendar month after the date hereof copies of the unaudited financial
statements of the Company for the month ended or ending as of the end of such

with a copy of such notice for its reasonable review and comment prior to
such distribution.

       

(b) To the extent this Agreement is adopted and the Merger is approved by
less than unanimous written consent of the Company Securityholders entitled
to vote thereon, the Company shall promptly prepare and distribute a notice
in form and substance as required by Section 615(c) of the NYBCL to all of
the Company Securityholders who have not consented thereto in writing.
The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of such notice for its
reasonable review and comment prior to such distribution.

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare and timely
file or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns of the

similar Taxes imposed upon or resulting from the Merger shall be borne

Section 5.7 _Resignations_. The Company shall obtain the
written resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of each director of
the Company who Parent designates by written notice delivered to the Company
no later than one week prior to the Closing.

  

Section 5.8 _Directors  and Officers Liability Insurance_.

  

(a) The Company and Parent agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of each
individual who, as of the Effective Time, is a present or former director or
officer of the Company (the " _Covered Persons_ ") as provided in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws, in effect as of the
date hereof, shall, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect after the
Effective Time.  Until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the Covered Persons than are set forth in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws, in effect as of
the date hereof, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder, as of the
Effective Time, of any Covered Person, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the Company further agree that all
rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses now existing in favor of
Covered Persons in any indemnification agreement between such person and the
Company, as the case may be, or under Law shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such
agreement or Law.

       

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at Parents expense, a so-called "tail" policy to the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (to be
effective as of the Effective Time), which "tail policy" shall provide
coverage for a period of six years from the Effective Time to those
individuals who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of each of
which has been delivered to the Parent) with coverage in amount and
scope substantially similar to those of the applicable policies in effect on
the date hereof. In the event that the Company fails to obtain such "tail"
policy prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
obtain such "tail" policy promptly after the Closing.

  

In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
after the Effective Time ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or a
substantial portion of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation (or their respective successors or
assigns) assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or their
respective successors or assigns) as contemplated by this _Section 5.8_. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Covered
Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 5.8_. The provisions of this _Section 5.8_  shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Covered Persons.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is agreed that
the rights of a Covered Person under this _Section 5.8_ shall be in addition
to, and not a limitation of, any other rights such Covered Person may have
under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws, any
other indemnification arrangements, the NYBCL or otherwise, and nothing in
this _Section 5.8_ shall have the effect of, or be construed as having the
effect of, reducing the benefits to the Covered Persons under the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws, any other
indemnification arrangements, the NYBCL or otherwise with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time.

  

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the
Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates, without the approval of
Parent, in the case of the Company and the Company, in the case of Parent or
Merger Sub, shall issue any press releases or otherwise make any public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, except as may be required by applicable Law,
including federal securities Laws, or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the
other parties an opportunity (to the extent practical) to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance and to consider such
comments in good faith; provided, however, that following the initial public
announcement of the Merger each of the parties may make internal
announcements to their respective employees, and the Company may make
announcements to its customers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, in each case regarding a general description of the Merger or that
are otherwise consistent with the parties permitted prior public disclosures
regarding this Agreement and the Merger.

       

Section 5.10 _Certain Actions in respect of Company Securityholders_. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly after the
date hereof Stockholder Consents from all Company Securityholders that have
not theretofore executed and delivered a Stockholder Consent to the Company.

  

Section 5.11 _Related Party Transactions_. The Company shall terminate each
Related Party Transaction (other than those identified in Section 5.11 of the
Company Disclosure Schedules) effective as of the Closing.

  

Section 5.12 _Employee Matters_. From and after the Closing Date, employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the " _Employees_
") shall continue their employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, except as set forth in _Section 5.12_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, shall be treated as described in the remainder of this _Section
5.12_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2008, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, provide (i) each Employee with wages or salaries, and
bonus opportunities and severance, as applicable, that are at least equal to
the wages or salaries, and bonus opportunities and severance, as applicable,
of such Employee in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
each Employee and with benefits (other than equity incentive benefits), in
the aggregate, substantially comparable to those in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time.  From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor, pay,
perform and satisfy any and all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities
to or in respect to each Employee, former Employee or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under the terms of each Plan, unless or until such
Plan is amended or terminated in accordance with its terms by Parent or the
Company. Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause each Plan
(including, but not limited to each severance plan or arrangement) maintained
or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and in which an
Employee participates or will participate to provide credit for any employee
co-insurance or similar amounts and to recognize all service of such Employee
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and
vesting to the same extent as such service would have been credited under the
Plan prior to the Closing Date and, if applicable, to waive any exclusions
for preexisting conditions; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent
or the Company be obligated to grant credit for service to any Employee where
crediting such service would result in the payment of duplicate benefits.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Parents or the Companys ability to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) shall be construed to require Parent or the Company to
recognize any service of the Employee for purposes of accrual of benefit
service, (iv) shall be construed to require Parent or the Company to permit
any Employee to participate in any new or existing Plan sponsored by Parent,
(v) is intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this
Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or
(vi) is intended to confer upon any individual (including employees,
retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right
as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

following: (a) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case the failure of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct shall be measured as of such earlier
date); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any such representation
or warranty that is limited by "in all material respects," "in any material
respect," "material," "materially," "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
term or limitation, the amount of Losses

any Action brought by a Person not a party hereto (a " _Third Party Claim_
"), such Parent Indemnified Party shall give notice of such Third Party Claim
to the Stockholder Representative (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), but the
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
Liability it may have to such Person, except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.  If a Parent
Indemnified Party gives such notice, the Indemnifying Party, upon giving
notice to such Parent Indemnified Party, will be entitled to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and
expense and the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to prosecute, appeal,
negotiate, resolve, settle, compromise, arbitrate or otherwise pursue such
Third Party Claim, in whole or in part, subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party exercises its rights
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have no obligation to indemnify or pay for or reimburse any Parent
Indemnified Party for any attorneys fees or expenses incurred by the Parent
Indemnified Party after the assumption of the defense of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel to the Parent Indemnified Party will be indemnifiable hereunder if,
in the reasonable view of counsel to the Parent Indemnified Party, (i) a
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and any Parent
Indemnified Party or (ii) there may be legal defenses available to the Parent
Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available
to the Indemnifying Party. The Parent Indemnified Party shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes.  The
Indemnifying Party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent
of the Parent Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any pending or threatened Third Party Claim relating to
the matters contemplated hereby if any Parent Indemnified Party is a party
thereto or has been threatened to be made a party thereto unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
each such Parent Indemnified Party from all Liability arising or that may
arise out of such Third Party Claim and provides solely for monetary relief
satisfied or to be satisfied by the Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying
Party does not exercise such right to assume the defense, the Parent
Indemnified Party may assume the defense thereof by counsel of the Parent
Indemnified Partys choosing and if the Parent Indemnified Party is
determined to be entitled to indemnification with respect to such Third Party
Claim, the Parent Indemnified Party will be permitted, subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ , to recover all
Losses incurred or sustained as a result of such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Third Party Claim relating to Taxes may be
settled, compromised or otherwise resolved without the consent of the
Surviving Corporation to the extent that such settlement, compromise or other
resolution would adversely affect the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable

       

for any Losses in connection with any settlement of any Third Party Claim by
the Parent Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent.

  

Section 8.4 _Written Notice of Claims_. No claim may be asserted under this
_Article VIII_ against the Indemnifying Party for breach of any
representation or warranty, unless written notice of such claim is received
by such party on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty
on which such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section 8.1_.

  

Section 8.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.

  

(a) No indemnity shall be payable out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount to
any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any claim under _Section 8.2(a)_
unless and until the aggregate of all Losses for which a claim is made under
_Section 8.2(a)_ exceeds $10,000,000, at which time Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification, but only to the extent such
Losses exceed $10,000,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such threshold
shall not be applicable to Losses (i) arising out of, relating to or
resulting from breaches or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.1_ , _Section 3.2_ , _Section 3.3_ , _Section 3.4_ or
_Section 3.20_ or (ii) Losses arising out of or resulting from fraud or
willful breach by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate amount payable to Parent
Indemnified Parties with respect to claims under _Section 8.2_  shall not
exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount (whether such amount is paid out of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount or in part out of such account and in part
pursuant to the several Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements). The
limitation set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply to payments,
if any, to which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled under the
Supplemental Indemnification Agreement.

  

(b) No indemnity shall be payable out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
(or under the several Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements) to any Parent
Indemnified Party with respect to any claim under _Section 8.2_ : (x) in
respect of any Taxes for any period beginning after the Closing and (y) in
respect of any Taxes of the Company or its Affiliates for any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning before the Closing to the extent that (i) such
Taxes would not (directly or indirectly) have been owed if the deduction
arising from the payments made pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the
Options and Warrants could have been claimed for the taxable period of the
Company ending on the Closing Date (and if unused, carried back to prior
taxable periods) or (ii) such Taxes result from a timing issue for which
there is a corresponding decrease in the Taxes of the Company or its
Affiliates in another taxable period (provided that this clause (ii) shall
not apply to any interest or penalties owed as a result of such
timing issue).

  

(c) If any Loss can be reduced by any recovery settlement or otherwise under
or pursuant to insurance coverage, the Parent Indemnified Party shall take
all appropriate steps to enforce such recovery to the extent it is reasonable
to do so and the amount of "Losses" for which any Person is entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall be reduced by any portion of such Losses for
which such Person actually recovers against an insurance policy or against
any third party other than pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(d) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to or have any right to set
off or seek any remedy against any amount in the Key Employee Escrow, or,
except as expressly set

       

forth in the several Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements, the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Account in connection with any matter, including any
Loss for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

  

Section 8.6 _Escrow Modification_. If at any time during the 20 Business
Days following the Closing (a) all three Senior Executives shall have
purchased common stock of Parent in complete satisfaction of
their obligations to do so under the Investment Agreements and (b) all three
Senior Executives notify Parent that they wish to avail themselves of the
procedures described in this _Section 8.6_ , then all three Senior Executives
may execute and deliver Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements to Parent.
Promptly following the date that Parent has received an executed Note
Drawdown and Collateral Agreement from each of the Senior Executives, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly instruct the
Indemnification Escrow Agent under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement to
release from the Indemnification Escrow Fund and pay promptly, and in any
event within three Business Days of receipt of such instruction, to each
Senior Executive (and, in the case of Bikoff, the Bikoff-Related Entities) an
amount equal to such Senior Executives contribution (and, in the case of
Bikoff, the Bikoff-Related Entities contribution) to the Indemnification
Escrow Fund. Simultaneously with the receipt of such payment, each Senior
Executive shall execute and deliver to Parent the demand note contemplated by
such Senior Executives Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreement. Such
payments, the execution by Parent and the Senior Executives of the several
Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements, and the execution and delivery of
such notes together constitute the " _Escrow Modification_ " for purposes of
this Agreement and the Escrow Modification shall be deemed to have occurred
upon the making by the Indemnification Escrow Agent of the payments to the
Senior Executives (and, in the case of Bikoff, the Bikoff-Related Entities)
contemplated by the preceding sentence.

  

Section 8.7 _Indemnification Escrow_. In the event that any
Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for Losses hereunder,
such payment shall be made solely out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
and, if the Escrow Modification shall have occurred, to the extent expressly
provided for in the several Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements. In the
event that the Indemnification Escrow Account no longer contains any funds,
and, if the Escrow Modification shall have occurred, all amounts due under
the several Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreements have been paid, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no further recourse of any nature other
than (i) any recourse or remedy they may have under the Supplemental
Indemnity Agreement and (ii) any recourse or remedy that may be available at
law against any party that has defrauded them.

  

Section 8.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree that
any indemnity payments pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

  

Section 8.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the rights and
remedies under this _Article VIII_ , subject to the limitations herein
contained shall be exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and
remedies that the Parent Indemnified Parties may have for monetary relief
with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty or any failure
to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
limitation on the right and remedies of any Parent Indemnified Party
shall not limit (i) any recourse or remedy they may have under the

       

Supplemental Indemnity Agreement or (ii) any recourse or remedy that may be
available to them at law against any party that has defrauded them.

  

Section 8.10 _Release of Indemnification Escrow_.

  

(a) In the event any Parent Indemnified Party shall have, prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period, delivered a notice of a claim
(a " _Pending Claim_ ") in respect of indemnification hereunder to the
Stockholder Representative, such Parent Indemnified Party and the Stockholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement upon (i) such
Parent Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder and the amount
of such Parent Indemnified Partys Losses and (ii) the amount on deposit in
the Indemnification Escrow Account that should be reserved (the " _Reserve
Amount_ ") in respect of such Pending Claim prior to resolution of the
matters in respect thereof described in clause (i). If they are unable so
to reach agreement any such dispute shall, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of
competent jurisdiction. Pending a resolution of the Reserve Amount in
respect of any claim, the Reserve Amount therefor shall be the amount of
Losses asserted in good faith by the Parent Indemnified Party in respect of
such Pending Claim. In the event that the Escrow Modification shall have
occurred, the Reserve Amount in respect of any claim shall be the product of
the amount that would have been the Reserve Amount if the Escrow Modification
had not occurred and the General Escrow Percentage.

  

(b) Upon the resolution of the amount of such Parent Indemnified Partys
Losses in respect of any Pending Claim, the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent under the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement to pay to the Surviving Corporation or the pertinent Parent
Indemnified Party the lesser of (i) the amount of such Losses multiplied by
the General Escrow Percentage and (ii) the balance on deposit in the
Indemnification Escrow Account. In the event the Escrow Modification shall
have occurred, an additional amount in respect of such Losses shall be paid
in accordance with the terms of each Note Drawdown and Collateral Agreement.

  

(c) Promptly following the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing
Date, and from time to time thereafter until the second anniversary of the
Closing, upon request by the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent under the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement to pay:

  

(i) to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Entitled Company
Securityholders as Additional Per Share Merger Consideration, the product of
(I) one minus the Appraisal Rights Fraction and (II) the amount by which (x)
the funds remaining on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account exceed
(y) the sum of the Late Survival Amount and the amounts of all Reserve
Amounts at such time, and

  

(ii) to the Surviving Corporation, the product of (I) the Appraisal Rights
Fraction and (II) the amount described in clause (II) of subparagraph (c)(i)
above.

  

(d) Promptly following the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, and
from time to time thereafter until such time as there are no funds remaining
on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall instruct the Escrow Agent under the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement to pay:

       

(i) to the Exchange Agent for distribution to Entitled Company
Securityholders as Additional Per Share Merger Consideration, the product of
(I) one minus the Appraisal Rights Fraction and (II) the amount by which (x)
the funds remaining on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account exceed
(y) the sum of the amounts of all Reserve Amounts at such time, and

  

(ii) to the Surviving Corporation, the product of (I) the Appraisal Rights
Fraction and (II) the amount described in clause (II) of subparagraph (d)(i)
above.

  

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall be permitted to deduct from (x) the
Administrative Expense Amount, and (y) amounts received by it for
distribution under subparagraphs (c) and (d) above its reasonable out of
pocket expenses associated with the matters contemplated in _Section 9.3(c)_
, including its administration of indemnification claims multiplied by the
General Escrow Percentage, such deductions to be made ratably from amounts
received by it for distribution to the Entitled Company Securityholders. In
the event the Escrow Modification shall have occurred, an additional amount
in respect of such expenses shall be payable as set forth in the several Note
Drawdown and Collateral Agreements. The Administrative Expense Amount (which
shall include for all purposes of this Agreement any interest earned thereon)
shall be held in a segregated bank account by the Stockholder Representative.
 If any portion of the Administrative Expense Amount remains in such account
following the final resolution of any and all claims under this Agreement,
such remaining amount shall be distributed pursuant to _Section 8.10(d)_ ,
provided that for purposes of such distribution "Entitled
Company Securityholders" shall include the Senior Executives (and, in the
case of Bikoff, the Bikoff-Related Entities).

  

 **ARTICLE IX 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS**

  

Section 9.1 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all fees and expenses (including legal, accounting, financial advisory,

connection with the exploration of a potential business combination
transaction, including fees and expenses incurred in connection with the

Section 9.3 _Appointment of the Stockholder Representative_.

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, and without any further action by the
Company or the Company Securityholders, the Initial Stockholder
Representative or, upon the occurrence of a Resignation Event, the Substitute
Stockholder Representative shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact
for each such Person, for and on behalf of each such Person, for all purposes
under this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and, to the
extent applicable, the Key Employee Escrow Agreement and the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agreement, and each of the Initial Stockholder Representative and
the Substitute Stockholder Representative, by his signature below, agrees to
serve in such capacity (the " _Stockholder Representative_ "). A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all of the Company
Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all of the
Company Securityholders, and the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the Stock
Collateral Agent and the Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each such Company Securityholder. Neither the
Parent nor the

       

Indemnification Escrow Agent nor the Stock Collateral Agent shall have any
obligation to take any action sought by, or respond to any communication
from, any Company Securityholders, except as communicated by the Stockholder
Representative.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that the Initial Stockholder Representative receives notice of a Pending
Claim in respect of indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ for Losses that
arise out of or relate to a failure of any representation or warranty
contained in _Section 3.3_ to be true and correct or a failure of the Merger
Consideration Schedule to be true and correct (each a " _Resignation Event_
"), the Initial Stockholder Representative shall cease to be, and shall be
deemed to have resigned as Stockholder Representative and the Substitute
Stockholder Representative shall succeed the Initial Stockholder
Representative as Stockholder Representative, effective immediately, with all
rights, powers, and obligations described in this _Section 9.3_. The
Initial Stockholder Representative and the Substitute Stockholder
Representative shall each provide prompt written notice of such succession to
the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent.

  

(c) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, in its capacity as
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative shall have the
power and authority to take all such actions on behalf of each Company
Securityholders as the Stockholder Representative, in its sole judgment, may
deem to be in the best interests of the Company Securityholders or otherwise
appropriate on all matters related to or arising from this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Key Employee Escrow Agreement and the
Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement. Such powers shall include:

  

(i) executing and delivering the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and any and
all supplements, amendments, waivers or modifications thereto and all
certificates, consents and other documents contemplated by this Agreement or
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or as may be necessary or appropriate to
effect the Transactions;

  

(ii) giving and receiving notices and other communications relating to this
Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement;

  

(iii) taking or refraining from taking any actions (whether by negotiation,
settlement, litigation or otherwise) to resolve or settle all matters and
disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement and the performance or enforcement of the obligations,
duties and rights pursuant to this Agreement or the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement;

  

(iv) accepting any payment due by Parent or the Indemnification Escrow Agent
to the Company Securityholders (it being understood that the Stockholder
Representatives receipt of the full payment amount due from Parent or the
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be in full satisfaction of such payment
obligation of Parent or the Indemnification Escrow Agent to the Company
Securityholders);

  

(v) authorizing or disputing the release to Parent of all or some of the
amount contained in the Indemnification Escrow Account in connection with any
claim by the Parent pursuant to _Article VIII_ ;

       

(vi) taking all actions necessary or appropriate in connection with any Third
Party Claims pursuant to _Article VIII_ ;

  

(vii) engaging attorneys, accountants, financial and other advisors, paying
agents and other Representatives necessary or appropriate, in the sole
discretion of the Stockholder Representative in the performance of its duties
under this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement;

  

(viii) paying fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnification Escrow Agent,
the Key Employee Escrow Agent and the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent; and

  

(ix) taking all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

  

(d) The power of attorney appointing the Stockholder Representative as
attorney-in-fact is coupled with an interest and the death or incapacity of
any Company Securityholders shall not terminate or diminish the authority and
agency of the Stockholder Representative.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the
Stockholder Representative shall have no duties or responsibilities under
this Agreement except for those expressly set forth herein, (ii) no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on
behalf of any Company Securityholder shall otherwise exist against or with
respect to the Stockholder Representative in its capacity as such and (iii)
any claim against the Stockholder Representative made in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement by any Person shall be satisfied solely from the
Indemnification Escrow Account, and neither the Stockholder Representative
nor any of its successors, assigns, representatives or heirs shall have any
personal liability with respect to any such claim.

  

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement; Modifications_.

  

(a) The agreement of the parties, which consists of this Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Schedules, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Key
Employee Escrow Agreement, the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement, the
several Pledge and Security Agreements, to the extent entered into, between
each of the Senior Executives and Parent, the several Demand Notes, to the
extent entered into, by each of the Senior Executives in favor of Parent, and
the Note Drawdown Indemnification and Collateral Agreement, sets forth the
entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes any
prior agreement or understanding, written or oral, relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement.

  

(b) This Agreement may be modified and/or amended with respect to any
provision contained herein at any time by written action of Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder Representative.

  

Section 9.5 _Waiver_. Any term or condition hereof may be waived at any time
by the party hereto that is entitled to the benefits thereof by a written
instrument duly executed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect

       

the validity of this Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to
enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this
Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.

  

Section 9.6 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Severability_.  Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
transferred, assigned or delegated by any of the parties hereto, in whole or
in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
attempt to make any such transfer, assignment or delegation without such
consent shall be null and void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. The provisions
of this Agreement are severable, and in the event that any one or more
provisions are deemed illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions shall
remain in full force and effect unless the deletion of such provision shall
cause this Agreement to become materially adverse to any party, in which
event the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to arrive at an
accommodation that best preserves for the parties the benefits and
obligations of the offending provision.

  

Section 9.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause
irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction as provided in _Section 9.9_ to compel performance of such
partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of
specific performance of its obligations hereunder without proof of actual
damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond.
Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a partys
breach of its obligations but shall be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity.

  

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This agreement shall be governed by and
construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York (other than its conflict of law principles to the extent that the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction would be required
thereby, but with reference to Section 5-1401 of the New York General
Obligations Law, which by its terms applies to this Agreement) and to the
extent applicable to the Merger, the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  

Section 9.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any Action arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (and
each agrees that no such Action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall be brought by
it except in such courts).  The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive
(and agree not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York or that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto also
agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto in

       

connection with any Action shall be conclusive and binding on such party and
that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or
exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of
the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

  

Section 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, and agrees to
cause each of its Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
Each party (a) certifies that no Representative of the other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of an Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this
agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 9.10_.

  

Section 9.11 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; except that, assuming the Closing occurs, the
provisions of _Section 5.8_ are intended for the benefit of the individuals
specified therein and such individuals shall have the right to enforce such
section in their own names.

  

Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

  

Section 9.13 _Performance of Obligations_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.

corporation (" _Parent_ "), Mustang Acquisition Company, LLP, a Delaware
limited liability partnership (" _Merger Sub_ "), J. Darius Bikoff ("
_Bikoff_ "), and Michael Repole (" _Repole_ "), each solely in his capacity,
respectively, as the Individual Stockholder Representative and the Substitute

_Indemnification Escrow Agent_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement
and not defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to them in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May [ ], 2007 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, Merger Sub, Energy Brands, Inc.
d/b/a Glaceau, a New York corporation, and the Stockholder Representative.

  

The parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
hereby agree as follows:

  

# 1. _Appointment of Indemnification Escrow Agent; Establishment of Escrow_.

  

## (a) The parties hereto acknowledge that on the date hereof, to secure the
payment obligations, if any, under Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub has deposited with the Indemnification Escrow Agent $[ **
] **(the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ "). The Indemnification Escrow
Agent acknowledges receipt of the Indemnification Escrow Amount.  The
Indemnification Escrow Amount _plus_ any Escrow Fund Earnings (as defined
below) and the Escrow Amount (as defined in the Put/Call Agreement, if any)
_minus_ any amounts released or disbursed therefrom from time to time shall
be referred to herein as the " _Indemnification Escrow Funds_ ". The
Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be held in trust and shall not be subject
to lien or attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party hereto and shall be used solely for the purposes and
conditions set forth herein.

  

## (b) The parties hereto acknowledge that, pursuant to the Put/Call
Agreements, in connection with the exercise of the Put Option or the Call
Option, Parent or TTGBI and TL, as applicable, shall deposit the Escrow
Amount in an account designated by the Indemnification Escrow Agent. Upon
receipt, Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow Amount as part of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds pursuant to this Agreement.

  

## (c) Parent and the Stockholder Representative hereby jointly appoint the
Indemnification Escrow Agent as the Indemnification Escrow Agent under this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agent
hereby

        

## agrees to act as Indemnification Escrow Agent and to hold, safeguard and
disburse, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Indemnification Escrow Funds.

  

# 2. _Investment of Funds_.

  

## (a) Except as Parent and the Stockholder Representative may from time to
time jointly instruct the Indemnification Escrow Agent in writing, the
Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be invested from time to time:

  

#### (i) in United States Treasury securities;

  

#### (ii) one or more money market accounts or certificates of deposit
(having a duration of no more than thirty (30) days) with any bank or trust
company organized under the laws of the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof or under the laws of any state thereof
which has a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000; or

  

#### (iii) other investments, such as commercial paper with a maturity of not
more than thirty (30) days and rated at least P-1 by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or A-1 by Standard and Poors Corporation, as may be specifically
approved in writing by the Stockholder Representative.

  

## (b) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall liquidate any investments held
in order to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this
Agreement.  The parties to this Agreement recognize and agree that
the Indemnification Escrow Agent will not provide supervision,
recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of moneys held in
the Indemnification Escrow Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any investment described herein. The Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any
investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any
liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the
Stockholder Representative and Parent to give the Indemnification Escrow
Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Indemnification Escrow Funds.
Receipt, investment and reinvestment of the Indemnification Escrow Funds
shall be confirmed by Indemnification Escrow Agent as soon as practicable by
account statement, and any discrepancies in any such account statement shall
be noted by the Stockholder Representative and Parent to the Indemnification
Escrow Agent within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt thereof. Failure
to inform the Indemnification Escrow Agent in writing of any discrepancies in
any such account statement within said thirty (30) day period shall
conclusively be deemed confirmation of such account statement in its
entirety.

  

## (c) If the Indemnification Escrow Agent does not receive written
instructions from the Stockholder Representative and Parent jointly directing
the investment or reinvestment of any of the Indemnification Escrow Funds,
the Indemnification Escrow

        

## Agent shall automatically and forthwith invest such funds in a
money market account as described in Section 2(a) until the Indemnification
Escrow Agent has received contrary joint written instructions from the
Stockholder Representative and Parent. Such written instructions referred to
in the foregoing sentence shall specify the type and identity of the
investments to be purchased and/or sold and shall also include the name of
the broker-dealer, if any, which the Stockholder Representative and Parent
jointly direct the Indemnification Escrow Agent to use in respect of such
investment, any particular settlement procedures required (which settlement
procedures shall be consistent with industry standards and practices), and
such other information as the Indemnification Escrow Agent may reasonably
require. The interest or income of any investments made pursuant to this
Section 2 shall collectively be referred to herein as the " _Escrow Fund
Earnings_."

  

# 3. _Release of Funds_. Except as provided in Section 6, funds shall be
released by the Indemnification Escrow Agent from the Indemnification Escrow
Funds only upon (i) the Indemnification Escrow Agents receipt of joint
written instructions of Parent and the Stockholder Representative or (ii) a
final, non-appealable judgment, order or decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction, in which event the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall promptly
disburse the specified funds in accordance with such written instructions,
judgment, order or decision.

  

# 4. _Termination of Escrow_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the final
distribution of all of the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

  

# 5. _Duties of Indemnification Escrow Agent_.

  

## (a) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or
obligations and shall be required to perform only such duties as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Indemnification Escrow Agent
shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with knowledge of the terms
and conditions of any other agreement, including the Merger Agreement. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of the
Merger Agreement and shall have no duty or responsibility to take any action
pursuant to the terms thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and those of the Merger Agreement,
the Indemnification Escrow Agent may rely on the terms and conditions of
this Agreement to govern and control in all respects.

  

## (b) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable, except for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct and, except with respect to claims
based upon such gross negligence or willful misconduct that are asserted
against the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnification Escrow
Agent (and any successor to the Indemnification Escrow Agent) and each of the
Indemnification Escrow Agents officers, directors,

        

## agents and employees from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, actions, damages and expenses, arising out of or in connection with
its entering into this Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder. The
right to the indemnity afforded hereby shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and any resignation or removal of the Indemnification Escrow Agent.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall in no
event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any of
the Indemnification Escrow Funds held by it hereunder in good faith in
accordance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, any
liability for any delays (not resulting from its gross negligence or willful
misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of the Indemnification Escrow
Funds, or any loss of interest incident to any such delays. Anything to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Indemnification Escrow Agent
be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever, including, without limitation, lost profits, even if the
Indemnification Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss
or damage and regardless of the form of action. The Indemnification Escrow
Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of it duties hereunder
directly or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the
careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult or retain
counsel, accountants, or other skilled persons as selected by it. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered
or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of
any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons (not resulting from
the Indemnification Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct).
In the event that the Indemnification Escrow Agent is uncertain as to its
duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands
from any party hereto, which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the
provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any
such action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held
in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise jointly in writing by Parent
and the Stockholder Representative, which eliminates such ambiguity or
uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Indemnification Escrow Agent, or by a
final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Indemnification Escrow Agent may interplead all of the
assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a
declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be
fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such
interpleaded assets or any action or nonaction based on such declaratory
judgment. The parties to this Agreement agree to pursue any redress or
recourse in connection with any dispute without making the Indemnification
Escrow Agent a party to the same, other than in connection with any dispute
alleging that the Indemnification Escrow Agent breached its obligations under
this Agreement.

  

## (c) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing
delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the
authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety
or validity of the service thereof, unless the

        

## Indemnification Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of any such lack
of authenticity, correctness, proprietary or validity. The Indemnification
Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting to
make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions
hereof has been duly authorized to do so unless the Indemnification Escrow
Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of authority. The Indemnification
Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of
any party hereto that is an entity has full power and authority to instruct
the Indemnification Escrow Agent on behalf of that party unless written
notice to the contrary is delivered to the Indemnification Escrow Agent or
unless the Indemnification Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of
power or authority.

  

## (d) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not have any interest in the
Indemnification Escrow Funds deposited hereunder and is serving as escrow
holder only and having only possession thereof. The Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall prepare and provide to the Stockholder Representative and Parent
a monthly information statement of the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
including the Escrow Fund Earnings, no later than the last calendar day in
respect of the immediately preceding full calendar month (the " _Monthly
Earnings Statement_ ").

  

## (e) The Indemnification Escrow Agent (and any successor to the
Indemnification Escrow Agent) may resign at any time upon thirty (30) days
prior notice to the Stockholder Representative and Parent, and may be
removed, with or without cause, by the consent of the
Stockholder Representative and Parent upon 30 days prior written notice to
the Indemnification Escrow Agent. Prior to the effective date of the
resignation or removal of the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall jointly appoint a successor escrow agent,
which shall be a bank or trust company having offices in New York, New York
and assets in excess of $1,000,000,000, to hold the Indemnification Escrow
Funds, and any such successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the
predecessor escrow agent an instrument accepting such appointment, upon which
such successor agent shall, without further act, become vested with all of
the rights, powers and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if
originally named herein. No such resignation or removal shall discharge any
liability or obligations of the Indemnification Escrow Agent prior to the
effective time of such resignation or removal. If no successor escrow agent
is appointed prior to the effective date of the termination or resignation of
the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall
first, place all of the Indemnification Escrow Funds at the disposal of a
court and petition the court to act as the successor escrow agent or to
appoint another entity to act as the successor escrow agent and second, if
the court does not agree to act as successor agent or fails to appoint
another entity to act as a successor escrow agent, deposit all of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds into the registry of any court of competent
jurisdiction and notify Parent and the Stockholder Representative in writing
of such deposit. In the event that the Indemnification Escrow Agent makes a

        

## deposit of the Indemnification Escrow Funds into the registry of a court
in the manner specified in the preceding sentence, the Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall thereupon be discharged from all further duties as
the Indemnification Escrow Agent hereunder.  The Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall have the right to withhold an amount equal to any amount due and
owing to the Indemnification Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe may be incurred by the
Indemnification Escrow Agent in connection with the termination of this
Agreement. Any entity into which the Indemnification Escrow Agent may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to
which all or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall
be the Indemnification Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

  

## (f) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be paid compensation (as
payment in full) for its services in accordance with the terms of _Exhibit A_
hereto, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and shall be
reimbursed promptly upon receipt of a written invoice for all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by it in
performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of one outside counsel, but not any fees or expenses allocated
to its internal counsel).  The Company Securityholders and the Parent shall
each be responsible for one-half of any such compensation and reimbursement
to which the Indemnification Escrow Agent is entitled; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be permitted from time to time,
with the consent of Parent and the Stockholder Representative, to deduct from
the Indemnification Escrow Funds cash in the amount required to satisfy the
portion of such compensation and reimbursement due from the Company
Securityholders.

  

## (g) In connection with any funds transfer, the Indemnification Escrow
Agent may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number
provided by the other parties hereto, pursuant to joint written instructions
of Parent and the Stockholder Representative, to identify ( _i_ ) the
beneficiary, ( _ii_ ) the beneficiarys bank or ( _iii_ ) an order executed
by such party using any such identifying number, even where its use may
result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of
funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank, or an intermediary bank
designated. The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have no liability with
respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds effected by the
Indemnification Escrow Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer
instructions provided to the Indemnification Escrow Agent by any party to
this Agreement.

  

## (h) The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise
any party as to the wisdom in selling or retaining, or taking or refraining
from any action with respect to, any securities or other property deposited
hereunder.

        

# 6. _Tax Matters_.

  

## (a) All Escrow Fund Earnings shall be accounted for by the Indemnification
Escrow Agent separately from the Indemnification Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary and except
as required by applicable Law, Escrow Fund Earnings shall be treated as
includable income of the Company Securityholders for United States federal
and applicable state and local income tax purposes based on their pro rata
share of such Escrow Fund Earnings. The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall
release to each Company Securityholder no later than 10 days after the end of
each calendar quarter, an amount equal to the product of such Company
Securityholders pro rata share of the Escrow Fund Earnings arising during
such quarter multiplied by 40%.

  

## (b) On or before the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative shall cause to be provided to the Indemnification Escrow Agent
a completed applicable Form W-9 or Form W-8 (or successor forms) for each
Company Securityholder. Except with respect to Form 1099s, the
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have no authority or responsibility to
prepare or file any federal, state or local tax return or report with respect
to the Indemnification Escrow Funds or any earnings thereon. This Section
6(b) shall survive notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.

# 8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (other than
its conflict of law principles to the extent that the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction would be required thereby, but with reference to
Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, which by its terms
applies to this Agreement).

  

# 9. _Security Procedures_ **.** In the event funds transfer instructions are
given whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, the Indemnification
Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by
telephone call-back to the Stockholder Representative and the person or
persons designated on Schedule 1 hereto (" _Schedule 1_ "), and the
Indemnification Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and
telephone numbers listed in Schedule 1 for call-backs may be changed only in
a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Indemnification Escrow
Agent. If the Indemnification Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the
authorized representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Indemnification
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions
by telephone call-back to [ ] (" _Executive Officers_ "). Such Executive
Officer shall deliver to the Indemnification Escrow Agent a fully executed
incumbency certificate, and the Indemnification Escrow Agent may rely upon
the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer.
The Indemnification Escrow Agent and the beneficiary\'s bank in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Parent or the Stockholder Representative to identify (
_i_ ) the beneficiary, ( _ii_ ) the beneficiary\'s bank or ( _iii_ ) an
intermediary bank. The Indemnification Escrow Agent may apply any of the
escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying
number, even when its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary
being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary\'s
bank or an intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Agreement
acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

  

# 10. _Enforcement_.

  

## (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in ( _i_ ) the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County and ( _ii_ ) the United States
District

        

## Court for the Southern District of New York, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  

## (b) The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a)
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (b) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the
purposes of any Action arising out of this Supplemental Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (and each agrees that no such Action
relating to this Supplemental Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought by it except in such courts). The parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any objection to
the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Supplemental Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or that any such Action brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto
also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto
in connection with any Action shall be conclusive and binding on such party
and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or
exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of
the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

  

## (c) Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates
to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Supplemental Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Each party (a)
certifies that no Representative of the other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of an
Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and
the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this agreement by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this paragraph.

  

# 11. _Interpretation_. The section headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
meaning or interpretation of any provision hereof. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. Solely as
among the parties hereto other than the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the
Merger Agreement, as it may from time to time be amended, shall control in
the event of any conflict or inconsistency with this Agreement.

  

# 12. _Entire Agreement; Modification, Waiver; Counterparts_.  This
Agreement constitutes the sole agreement, and supersedes all
prior agreements, understandings and

        

# statements, written or oral, between the parties hereto or any of his
respective affiliates and any other person with respect to the subject matter
hereof. The terms of this Agreement may not be modified or otherwise amended,
or waived, except pursuant to a written agreement signed by the parties
hereto.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

  

# 13. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not
have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of
rendering any other provision or provisions contained herein invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.

  

# 14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
_provided_ that any assignment, by operation of law or otherwise, by either
party hereto shall require the prior written consent of the other party, and
any purported assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void
and unenforceable, except that Parent may assign as collateral any and/or all
of its rights under this Agreement by way of security to any banks and/or
holders of debt securities and/or financial institutions and/or hedge
counterparties and/or any other person lending money, providing credit
or otherwise providing financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  

# 15. _Business Day_. If any day specified in this Agreement for the taking
of action by the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be a Business Day,
then such action shall be taken on the next succeeding day that is a Business
Day.

  

# 16. _Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Indemnification Escrow
Agent, Parent and the Stockholder Representative hereby represents and
warrants ( _a_ ) that this Agreement has been duly authorized and executed
and delivered on its behalf and constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation and ( _b_ ) that the execution and performance of this Agreement
by such person does not and will not violate any applicable Law.

 **KEY EMPLOYEE ESCROW AGREEMENT**

  

This Key Employee Escrow Agreement, dated as of [ ], 2007 (this
" _Agreement_ "), is made by and among The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), J. Darius Bikoff (" _Bikoff_ ") and Michael
Repole (" _Repole_ "), each solely in his capacity as, respectively, the
Initial Stockholder Representative and the Substitute
Stockholder Representative, Energy Brands Inc. d/b/a Glaceau, a New York
corporation (the " _Company_ "), [NAME], (" _Key Employee_ "), and [
], as escrow agent (the " _Key Employee Escrow Agent_ "). Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings given to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May
24, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, Mustang
Acquisition Company, LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, the Company, the Initial Stockholder
Representative and the Substitute Stockholder Representative.

  

The parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
hereby agree as follows:

  

# 1. _Consent of Key Employee; Appointment of Key Employee Escrow Agent;
Establishment of Escrow_.

  

## (a) The Key Employee hereby consents to Merger Subs deposit of the Key
Employees portion of the Key Employee Escrow Amount to the Individual
Account in accordance with the term and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

  

## (b) The parties hereto acknowledge that on the date hereof Merger Sub has
deposited with the Key Employee Escrow Agent $10,436,376 (the " _Key Employee
Escrow Amount_ "). **** The Escrow Agent acknowledges receipt of the Key
Employee Escrow Amount and will deposit the Key Employees portion of the Key
Employee Escrow Amount ($[ ]) into a separate account (the "
_Individual Account_ "). The Key Employee Escrow Amount _plus_  any Escrow
Fund Earnings (as defined below) _minus_ any amounts released or disbursed
therefrom from time to time shall be referred to herein as the "
_Key Employee Escrow Funds_ ". The Key Employee Escrow Funds shall be held
in trust and shall not be subject to lien or attachment, trustee process or
any other judicial process of any creditor of any party hereto and shall be
used solely for the purposes and conditions set forth herein.

  

## (c) Parent and the Key Employee hereby jointly appoint the Key Employee
Escrow Agent as the Key Employee Escrow Agent under this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement and the Key Employee Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as
Key Employee

       

## Escrow Agent and to hold, safeguard and disburse, pursuant to the terms
and conditions hereof, the Key Employee Escrow Funds.

  

# 2. _Investment of Funds_.

  

## (a) Except as Parent and the Stockholder Representative may from time to
time jointly instruct the Key Employee Escrow Agent in writing, the
Key Employee Escrow Funds shall be invested from time to time:

  

#### (i) in United States Treasury securities;

  

#### (ii) one or more money market accounts or certificates of deposit
(having a duration of no more than thirty (30) days) with any bank or trust
company organized under the laws of the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof or under the laws of any state thereof
which has a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000; or

  

#### (iii) other investments, such as commercial paper with a maturity of not
more than thirty (30) days and rated at least P-1 by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or A-1 by Standard and Poors Corporation, as may be specifically
approved in writing by the Stockholder Representative.

  

## (b) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall liquidate any investments held in
order to provide funds necessary to make required payments under this
Agreement.  The parties to this Agreement recognize and agree that the Key
Employee Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice
relating to either the investment of moneys held in the Key Employee Escrow
Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment
described herein. The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not have any liability
for any loss sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment
prior to its maturity or for the failure of the Key Employee and Parent to
give the Key Employee Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Key
Employee Escrow Funds. Receipt, investment and reinvestment of the Key
Employee Escrow Funds shall be confirmed by Key Employee Escrow Agent as soon
as practicable by account statement, and any discrepancies in any
such account statement shall be noted by the Key Employee and Parent to the
Key Employee Escrow Agent within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt thereof. Failure to inform the Key Employee Escrow Agent in writing
of any discrepancies in any such account statement within said thirty (30)
day period shall conclusively be deemed confirmation of such account
statement in its entirety.

  

## (c) If the Key Employee Escrow Agent does not receive written instructions
from the Key Employee and Parent jointly directing the investment or
reinvestment of any of the Key Employee Escrow Funds, the Key Employee Escrow
Agent shall automatically and forthwith invest such funds in a money market
account as described in

       

## Section 2(a) until the Key Employee Escrow Agent has received contrary
joint written instructions from the Key Employee and Parent.  Such written
instructions referred to in the foregoing sentence shall specify the type and
identity of the investments to be purchased and/or sold and shall also
include the name of the broker-dealer, if any, which the Key Employee and
Parent jointly direct the Key Employee Escrow Agent to use in respect of such
investment, any particular settlement procedures required (which settlement
procedures shall be consistent with industry standards and practices), and
such other information as the Key Employee Escrow Agent may reasonably
require. The interest or income of any investments made pursuant to this
Section 2 shall collectively be referred to herein as the " _Escrow Fund
Earnings_."

  

# 3. _Release of Funds_. The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall release the Key
Employee Escrow Fund to an account specified in writing by the Key Employee
on the first Business Day of 2009.

  

# 4. _Termination of Escrow_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the final
distribution of all of the Key Employee Escrow Funds in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

  

# 5. _Duties of Key Employee Escrow Agent_.

  

## (a) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or
obligations and shall be required to perform only such duties as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall
neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with knowledge of the terms and
conditions of any other agreement, including the Merger Agreement. The Key
Employee Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of the Merger
Agreement and shall have no duty or responsibility to take any action
pursuant to the terms thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and those of the Merger Agreement, the Key
Employee Escrow Agent may rely on the terms and conditions of this Agreement
to govern and control in all respects.

  

## (b) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not be liable, except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct and, except with respect to claims
based upon such gross negligence or willful misconduct that are asserted
against the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Key Employee Escrow Agent (and
any successor to the Key Employee Escrow Agent) and each of the Key Employee
Escrow Agents officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, arising
out of or in connection with its entering into this Agreement and carrying
out its duties hereunder. The right to the indemnity afforded hereby shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and any resignation or removal of
the Key Employee Escrow Agent.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Key
Employee Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with its
investment or reinvestment of any

       

## of the Key Employee Escrow Funds held by it hereunder in good faith in
accordance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, any
liability for any delays (not resulting from its gross negligence or willful
misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of the Key Employee Escrow
Funds, or any loss of interest incident to any such delays. Anything to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Key Employee Escrow Agent be
liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever, including, without limitation, lost profits, even if the Key
Employee Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action. The Key Employee Escrow Agent
may execute any of its powers and perform any of it duties hereunder directly
or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the careful
selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult or retain counsel,
accountants, or other skilled persons as selected by it. The Key Employee
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons (not resulting from the Key
Employee Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct). In the event
that the Key Employee Escrow Agent is uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party
hereto, which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this
Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any such action and
its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until
it shall be directed otherwise jointly in writing by Parent and the Key
Employee, which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction
of the Key Employee Escrow Agent, or by a final and non-appealable order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Key Employee Escrow Agent
may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent
jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain
circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or
obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or
nonaction based on such declaratory judgment. The parties to this Agreement
agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute
without making the Key Employee Escrow Agent a party to the same, other than
in connection with any dispute alleging that the Key Employee Escrow
Agent breached its obligations under this Agreement.

  

## (c) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing
delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the
authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety
or validity of the service thereof, unless the Key Employee Escrow Agent has
actual knowledge of any such lack of authenticity, correctness, proprietary
or validity.  The Key Employee Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any
instrument or signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may
assume that the person purporting to make any statement or execute any
document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to
do so unless the Key Employee Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack
of authority. The Key Employee Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the
undersigned representative

       

## of any party hereto that is an entity has full power and authority to
instruct the Key Employee Escrow Agent on behalf of that party unless written
notice to the contrary is delivered to the Key Employee Escrow Agent or
unless the Key Employee Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of
power or authority.

  

## (d) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not have any interest in the Key
Employee Escrow Funds deposited hereunder and is serving as escrow holder
only and having only possession thereof. The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall
prepare and provide to the Key Employee and Parent a monthly
information statement of the Key Employee Escrow Amount, including the Escrow
Fund Earnings, no later than the last calendar day in respect of the
immediately preceding full calendar month (the " _Monthly Earnings Statement_
").

  

## (e) The Key Employee Escrow Agent (and any successor to the Key Employee
Escrow Agent) may resign at any time upon thirty (30) days prior notice to
the Key Employee and Parent, and may be removed, with or without cause, by
the consent of the Key Employee and Parent upon 30 days prior written notice
to the Key Employee Escrow Agent. Prior to the effective date of the
resignation or removal of the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the Key Employee and
Parent shall jointly appoint a successor escrow agent, which shall be a bank
or trust company having offices in New York, New York and assets in excess of
$1,000,000,000, to hold the Key Employee Escrow Funds, and any such successor
escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the predecessor escrow agent an
instrument accepting such appointment, upon which such successor agent shall,
without further act, become vested with all of the rights, powers and duties
of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named herein. No such
resignation or removal shall discharge any liability or obligations of the
Key Employee Escrow Agent prior to the effective time of such resignation or
removal. If no successor escrow agent is appointed prior to the effective
date of the termination or resignation of the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the
Key Employee Escrow Agent shall first, place all of the Key Employee Escrow
Funds at the disposal of a court and petition the court to act as the
successor escrow agent or to appoint another entity to act as the successor
escrow agent and second, if the court does not agree to act as successor
agent or fails to appoint another entity to act as a successor escrow agent,
deposit all of the Key Employee Escrow Funds into the registry of any court
of competent jurisdiction and notify Parent and the Key Employee in writing
of such deposit. In the event that the Key Employee Escrow Agent makes a
deposit of the Key Employee Escrow Funds into the registry of a court in the
manner specified in the preceding sentence, the Key Employee Escrow Agent
shall thereupon be discharged from all further duties as the Key Employee
Escrow Agent hereunder. The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall have the right to
withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Key Employee
Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Key Employee Escrow Agent shall
reasonably believe may be incurred by the Key Employee Escrow Agent in
connection with the termination of the Escrow Agreement. Any entity into which
the Key Employee Escrow Agent may be merged or

       

## converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all
or substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Key
Employee Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

  

## (f) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall be paid compensation (as payment
in full) for its services in accordance with the terms of _Exhibit A_ hereto,
the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and shall be
reimbursed promptly upon receipt of a written invoice for all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by it in
performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of one outside counsel, but not any fees or expenses allocated
to its internal counsel). The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
each be responsible for one-half of any such compensation and reimbursement
to which the Key Employee Escrow Agent is entitled.

  

## (g) In connection with any funds transfer, the Key Employee Escrow Agent
may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number
provided by the other parties hereto, pursuant to joint written instructions
of Parent and the Key Employee, to identify ( _i_ ) the beneficiary, ( _ii_ )
the beneficiarys bank or ( _iii_ ) an order executed by such party using any
such identifying number, even where its use may result in a person other than
the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than
the beneficiarys bank, or an intermediary bank designated. The Key Employee
Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to the transfer or
distribution of any funds effected by the Key Employee Escrow Agent pursuant
to wiring or transfer instructions provided to the Key Employee Escrow Agent
by any party to this Agreement.

  

## (h) The Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise any
party as to the wisdom in selling or retaining, or taking or refraining from
any action with respect to, any securities or other property deposited
hereunder.

  

# 6. _Tax Matters_.

  

## (a) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, for United States
federal, state and local tax purposes, the parties hereto agree to treat the
Key Employee Escrow Funds as owned by the Key Employee, and to file all tax
returns on a basis consistent with such treatment.

  

## (b) All Escrow Fund Earnings shall be accounted for by the Key Employee
Escrow Agent separately from the Key Employee Escrow Amount.
 Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
Escrow Fund Earnings shall be treated as having been received by the Key
Employee for United States federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties hereto
agree that, for United States federal and applicable state and local income
tax purposes, the Key Employee shall report Escrow Fund Earnings as their
income.

       

## (c) On or before the execution of this Agreement, the Key Employee shall
cause to be provided to the Key Employee Escrow Agent a completed applicable
Form W-9 (or successor form). Except with respect to Form 1099s, the Key
Employee Escrow Agent shall have no authority or responsibility to prepare or
file any federal, state or local tax return or report with respect to the Key
Employee Escrow Funds or any earnings thereon. This Section 6(b) shall
survive notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.

## All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed

5:00 p.m. on a Business Day in the place of receipt.  Otherwise, any such
notice, request or communication shall be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day in the place of receipt.

  

# 8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (other than
its conflict of law principles to the extent that the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction would be required thereby, but with reference to
Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, which by its terms
applies to this Agreement).

  

# 9. _Security Procedures_.  In the event funds transfer instructions are
given whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, the Key Employee Escrow
Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone
call-back to the Stockholder Representative and the person or persons
designated on Schedule 1 hereto (" _Schedule 1_ "), and the Key Employee
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the
person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers listed
in Schedule 1 for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually
received and acknowledged by the Key Employee Escrow Agent. If the Key
Employee Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized
representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Key Employee Escrow Agent is
hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone
call-back to [  ] (" _Executive Officers_ ").  Such Executive Officer shall
deliver to the Key Employee Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency
certificate, and the Key Employee Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation
of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Key Employee Escrow Agent and
the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any
account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Parent or the
Stockholder Representative to identify ( _i_ ) the beneficiary, ( _ii_ )
the beneficiarys bank or ( _iii_ ) an intermediary bank. The Key Employee
Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank designated.
The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that these security
procedures are commercially reasonable.

  

# 10. _Enforcement_.

  

## (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their

       

## specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in ( _i_ ) the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, New York County and ( _ii_ ) the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  

## (b) The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a)
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (b) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the
purposes of any Action arising out of this Supplemental Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (and each agrees that no such Action
relating to this Supplemental Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought by it except in such courts). The parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any objection to
the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Supplemental Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or that any such Action brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  Each of the parties hereto
also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto
in connection with any Action shall be conclusive and binding on such party
and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified
or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of
the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

  

## (c) Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates
to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Supplemental Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Each party (a)
certifies that no Representative of the other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of an Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this
agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this paragraph.

  

# 11. _Interpretation_. The section headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
meaning or interpretation of any provision hereof. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. Solely as
among the parties hereto other than the Key Employee Escrow Agent, the Merger
Agreement, as

       

# it may from time to time be amended, shall control in the event of any
conflict or inconsistency with this Agreement.

  

# 12. _Entire Agreement; Modification, Waiver; Counterparts_. This Agreement
constitutes the sole agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings and statements, written or oral, between the parties hereto or
any of his respective affiliates and any other person with respect to the
subject matter hereof. The terms of this Agreement may not be modified or
otherwise amended, or waived, except pursuant to a written agreement signed
by the parties hereto.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

# 13. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not
have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of
rendering any other provision or provisions contained herein invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.

  

# 14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
_provided_ that any assignment, by operation of law or otherwise, by either
party hereto shall require the prior written consent of the other party, and
any purported assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void
and unenforceable, except that Parent may assign as collateral any and/or all
of its rights under this Agreement by way of security to any banks and/or
holders of debt securities and/or financial institutions and/or hedge
counterparties and/or any other person lending money, providing credit
or otherwise providing financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  

# 15. _Business Day_. If any day specified in this Agreement for the taking
of action by the Key Employee Escrow Agent shall not be a Business Day, then
such action shall be taken on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.

  

# 16. _Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Key Employee Escrow
Agent, Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Key Employee hereby
represents and warrants ( _a_ ) that this Agreement has been duly authorized
and executed and delivered on its behalf and constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligation and ( _b_ ) that the execution and performance of this
Agreement by such person does not and will not violate any applicable Law.

 **Form of**

  

 **NOTE DRAWDOWN, INDEMNIFICATION 
 AND ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AGREEMENT**

  

 **THIS NOTE DRAWDOWN, INDEMNIFICATION AND ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL
AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of [
], 2007 between [Bikoff/Repole/Venuti] (" _Senior Executive_ ") and
The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "). Undefined
capitalized terms in this Agreement are defined in the Merger Agreement
defined below.

  

 ** _RECITALS_**

  

 **WHEREAS** , pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May [
], 2007, by and among Parent, Mustang Acquisition Company, LLP, a Delaware
limited liability partnership, the Company and J. Darius Bikoff and Michael
Repole, each of them solely in his capacity as representative of the
Company Securityholders (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), a portion of the
Merger Consideration was deposited in the Indemnification Escrow Account;

  

 **WHEREAS** , the Senior Executives allocable share of the funds on deposit
in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement is $ ;

  

 **WHEREAS** , pursuant to the Investment Agreement between Senior Executive
and Parent, Senior Executive has purchased for $ , 
shares of Parent common stock (the " _Parent Shares_ "), which Parent Shares
have been deposited in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account;

  

 **WHEREAS** , Senior Executive and [Bikoff/Repole/Venuti] (the " _Other
Senior Executives_ ") are desirous of causing the Escrow Modification to
occur such that they may obtain payment of their share of the funds on
deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and secure their obligations
in respect of indemnification payments, if any, due to the Parent Indemnified
Parties by delivering to the Parent a demand note in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Note_ "), and agreeing to the terms of this Agreement
and the Pledge and Security Agreement, dated   , 2007,
between [Bikoff/Repole/Venuti] and Parent (the " _Security Agreement_ ");
and.

  

 **WHEREAS** , the Other Senior Executives are contemporaneously entering
into Note Drawdown, Indemnification and Additional Collateral Agreements with
terms substantially similar to this Agreement.

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of these premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

1. _Note Drawdowns_. In the event that any payment is made out of the Indemnification Escrow Account under Section 8.10(b) of the Merger Agreement to any Parent Indemnified Party, Senior Executive shall be obligated to pay to Parent and Parent shall be

       

entitled to draw under the Note an amount equal to the amount of such payment
under Section 8.10(b) multiplied by a fraction, expressed as a percentage,
the numerator of which is % [such Senior Executives percentage
ownership at closing on a fully diluted basis] and the denominator of which
is the General Escrow Percentage (the "Applicable Percentage"). In the event
Senior Executive fails to pay the amount of such draw within three Business
Days of notice thereof, such failure shall be a default under this Agreement
and Parent shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent
under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to pay over to Parent an
amount of cash equal to the amount of such draw under the Note, and, if there
is not then sufficient cash in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account to
fund such payment, Parent shall instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent
either (at Parents option) to sell a sufficient amount of the Parent Shares
in such account to fund such payment or to deliver such number of shares,
valued at Fair Market Value, to the Parent, _provided_ , that if for any
reason the Escrow and Collateral Agent is unable to promptly sell a
sufficient number of Parent Shares in the open market upon receipt of an
instruction from Parent to do so, it shall deliver to Parent a sufficient
number of Parent Shares valued at Fair Market Value. Any such payment to
Parent shall be deemed a payment under, and shall reduce the outstanding
Principal Amount of, the Note. In the case of a delivery of the Pledged
Shares to the Parent, the obligations on the Note shall be reduced in
accordance with Section 9-608 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the
State of New York; provided, however, that Parent waives any right to any
claim for fees and expenses of collection or enforcement and, to the extent
provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorneys
fees and legal expenses, to which it might otherwise be entitled under the
UCC.

  

2. _Other Payment Obligations_. In the event that under Section 8.10(e) of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder Representative deducts from amounts received by it under Sections 8.10(c) or 8.10(d) of the Merger Agreement any amount to reimburse its expenses, Senior Executive shall, within three Business Days of notice of such payment, pay to the Stockholder Representative an amount equal to the amount of such payment multiplied by the Applicable Percentage.  In the event Senior Executive fails to make such payment at such time, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to, and shall instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to pay to the Stockholder Representative, an amount of cash equal to the amount of such required payment and, if there is not then sufficient cash in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account to fund such payment, to sell a sufficient amount of the Parent Shares in such account to fund such payment. Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested to release its lien in any such Parent Shares.

  

3. _Top-Up Payments_. In the event that at any time (1) the sum of (x) the amount of cash, if any, on deposit in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account plus (y) two thirds of the Fair Market Value of the Parent Shares on deposit in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account is less than (2) the amount on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account multiplied by the Applicable Percentage, Senior Executive shall pay into the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account, within three Business Days of notice of such shortfall, an amount of cash equal to the amount of such shortfall. In the event Senior Executive fails to make such payment at such time, Parent shall be entitled to, but shall not be obligated to, instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agreement to sell a sufficient amount of the Parent Shares, and hold in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account the proceeds of such sale, such that, following such action, the amount described in clause (1) of this paragraph is equal to the

       

amount described in clause (2) of this paragraph. As used in this Agreement,
" _Fair Market Value_ " of the Parent Shares means, as of any date, the
average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of such Parent
Shares for each of the five trading days prior to such date (as reported by
Bloomberg Financial L.P. using the VWAP function, or if unavailable, by
another authoritative source, or if no other authoritative source is
available, based upon the average of the daily closing prices (instead of the
daily volume-weighted average prices) for such five trading days, as reported
by Bloomberg Financial L.P. or another authoritative source).

  

4. _Pledge and Grant of Security Interest_. To secure the obligations hereunder, Senior Executive shall execute and deliver a Pledge and Security Agreement in substantially the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto.

  

5. _Release_.

  

(a) So long as no default by Senior Executive shall have occurred and be
continuing under this Agreement, any time when the amount of cash, if any, in
the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account exceeds the amount on deposit in the
Indemnification Escrow Account multiplied by the Applicable
Percentage, Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Senior Executive shall
promptly instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agreement to pay to the Senior Executive the amount of such excess
cash and Parent shall takes such steps as may be necessary to release their
security interests in such excess cash.

  

(b) In the event that at any time after the third anniversary of the Closing
under the Merger Agreement (1) the sum of (x) the amount of cash, if any, on
deposit in the  Stock Escrow and Collateral Account plus (y) two thirds of
the Fair Market Value of the amount of Parent Shares on deposit in the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Account is greater than (2) the amount on deposit in
the Indemnification Escrow Account multiplied by the Applicable Percentage,
Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Senior Executive shall promptly
instruct the Escrow and Collateral Agent under the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agreement to pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount, comprised of
cash and Parent Shares in such proportions as the Indemnified Party shall
elect, such that, following such payment, the amount described in clause (1)
above is equal to the amount described in clause (2) above, and Parent shall
take such steps as may be necessary to release their security interests in
such excess cash and/or Parent Shares.

  

6. _Notices_. All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in conformance with Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement.

  

7. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which where so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.

  

8. _Headings_. The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning, construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

  

9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (other than its conflict of law

       

principles to the extent that the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby, but with reference to Section 5-1401
of the New York General Obligations Law, which by its terms applies to this
Agreement).

  

10. _ Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

(a) The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (b) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the purposes
of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (and each agrees that no such Action relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought by it except in such
courts). The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and agree not to
plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or that any such
Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable
judgment against a party hereto in connection with any Action shall be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment.

  

(b) Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party (a) certifies that
no Representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of an Action, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto
have been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this paragraph.

  

11. _No Setoffs_. Neither Parent nor any other party claiming under or in respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or consummated pursuant thereto shall have any right, in the nature of setoff or otherwise, to the amounts or assets on deposit in the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account, other than the rights respecting payments expressly set forth herein.

  

12. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.

  

13. _Entirety; Modification, Waiver_. This Agreement constitutes the sole agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and statements, written or oral, between the parties hereto or any of his respective affiliates and any other person with respect to the subject

       

matter hereof. The terms of this Agreement may not be modified or otherwise
amended, or waived, except pursuant to a written agreement signed by the
parties hereto.

(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

  

Section 3.2 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the
performance of Investors obligations hereunder will (a) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of

non-U.S. securities laws;

  

(b) the Purchased Shares must be held indefinitely and Investor must continue

in reliance upon Rule 144 promulgated under the Act (" _Rule 144_ "), such

agent in respect of the Purchased Shares, appropriate stop-transfer
instructions will be issued to such agent with respect to such shares.

the investment by Investor in the Purchased Shares.

  

Section 3.6 _Access to Information_. Investor has been furnished by Parent
prior to the date hereof with all information regarding Parent, which

conditions of the investment in the Purchased Shares. Investor has been
granted the opportunity to obtain any additional information that Investor
deems necessary to verify the accuracy of the information so provided.

solely for Investors own account for investment and not with a view to or
for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. Investor agrees that

Section 6.2 _Entire Agreement; Modifications_.

  

(a) This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between
the parties and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, written or
oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

  

(b) This Agreement may be modified and/or amended with respect to any
provision contained herein at any time by written action of Parent and
Investor.

  

Section 6.3 _Waiver_. Any term or condition hereof may be waived at any time
by the party hereto that is entitled to the benefits thereof by a written
instrument duly executed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect

       

the validity of this Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to
enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this
Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.

  

Section 6.4 A _ssignment; Binding Effect; Severability_.  Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
transferred, assigned or delegated by any of the parties hereto, in whole or
in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
attempt to make any such transfer, assignment or delegation without such
consent shall be null and void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. The provisions
of this Agreement are severable, and in the event that any one or more
provisions are deemed illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions shall
remain in full force and effect unless the deletion of such provision shall
cause this Agreement to become materially adverse to any party, in which
event the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to arrive at an
accommodation that best preserves for the parties the benefits and
obligations of the offending provision.

  

Section 6.5 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction as provided in _Section 6.7_ to compel performance of
such partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of
specific performance of its obligations hereunder without proof of actual
damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond.
Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a partys
breach of its obligations but shall be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity.

  

Section 6.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York (other than its conflict of law principles to the extent that the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction would be required
thereby, but with reference to Section 5-1401 of the New York General
Obligations Law, which by its terms applies to this Agreement).

  

Section 6.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any Action arising out of this

Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York or that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto also
agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto in
connection with any Action shall be conclusive and binding on such party and
that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the

       

United States.  A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment.

  

Section 6.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, and agrees to
cause each of its Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
Each party (a) certifies that no Representative of the other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of an Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this
agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 6.8_.

  

Section 6.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder.

  

Section 6.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

and, together with Bikoff and Repole, the " _Senior_ _Executives_ "),
each in his individual capacity, Bikoff, not in his individual capacity, but
in his capacity as the Initial Stockholder Representative under the Merger
Agreement described below, and Repole, not in his individual capacity, but in
his capacity as the Substitute Stockholder Representative under the
Merger Agreement described below, and [ ] as escrow agent and
control agent (the " _Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent_ "). Capitalized terms

(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, Mustang Acquisition
Company, LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, Energy Brands, Inc. d/b/a Glaceau, a New York

## (a) On the date hereof, as contemplated by Section 2.1(d) of the
Investment Agreements, Parent has delivered to the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agent for deposit into the Stock Escrow and Collateral Account, on
behalf of each Senior Executive, a certificate registered in the name of each
such Senior Executive representing the number of **** shares of common stock

Deposit_ "). The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent acknowledges receipt of
each Senior Executives deposit and will allocate the number of shares so
deposited by each Senior Executive into a separate account ****
identified on Schedule 2 hereto (each, an " _Individual Account_ "). The
Stock Escrow Deposit _plus_ any dividends or distributions earned on the
Stock Escrow Deposit (" _Escrow Fund Earnings_ ") and any further deposits of
shares of stock in Parent or cash by the Senior Executives _minus_ any
amounts released or disbursed therefrom from time to time shall be referred
to herein as the " _Stock Escrow Fund_ ". The Stock Escrow Fund shall be held
in trust and shall not be subject to lien or attachment, trustee process or
any other judicial process of any creditor of any party hereto, other than

Additional Collateral Agreements, each dated as of

       

## the date hereof between Parent and each of the Senior Executives and the

Parent and each of the Senior Executives (collectively, the " _Note Drawdown
Agreements_ "), and shall be used solely for the purposes and conditions set
forth herein and therein.

  

## (b) Parent and the Senior Executives hereby jointly appoint the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Agent as the escrow agent under this Agreement and the
Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent and to
hold, safeguard and disburse the Stock Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof.

  

## (c) Parent hereby appoints Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent as the
control agent for the limited purpose of acting as the agent on behalf of the
Parent with respect to the Stock Escrow Deposit for purposes of perfecting
the security interest of Parent in the Stock Escrow Deposit. The Stock
Escrow and Collateral Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to hold the
Stock Escrow Deposit in its possession or control (or in the possession
or control of its agents or bailees) solely for the purpose of perfecting
the security interest granted to the Parent in the Stock Escrow Deposit,
subject to the terms and conditions in the Note Drawdown Agreements. Parent

"control" under the UCC over the Security Escrow Deposit.

Executives Individual Account, including, without limitation, at any meeting
of Parents stockholders. Such proxies and powers are irrevocable and
binding upon the Senior Executives and the successors, assigns,
representatives and executors thereof, until the applicable waiting periods
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Acts of 1976 (the "
_HSR Act_ ") have expired, unless Investor would otherwise be permitted to do
so under applicable Law, at which time the proxy granted in this Section 3

Escrow and Collateral Agent (and any successor to the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agent) and each of the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agents
officers, directors, agents and employees from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, arising out of or
in connection with its entering into this Agreement and carrying out its
duties hereunder.  The right to the indemnity afforded hereby shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and any resignation or removal of the Stock

Escrow and Collateral Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with
its investment or reinvestment of any of the Stock Escrow Fund held by it
hereunder in good faith in accordance with the terms hereof, including,
without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting from its
gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of
the Stock Escrow Fund, or any loss of interest incident to any such delays.
Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Stock Escrow

damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits,
even if the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The

Agent is uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive
instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which in its opinion

judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agent may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court
of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to
certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and
all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any
action or nonaction based on such declaratory judgment. The parties to this
Escrow Agreement agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with
any dispute without making the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent a party to
the same, other than in connection with any dispute alleging that the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Agent breached its obligations under this Agreement.

       

## (c) The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other
writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the
authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety
or validity of the service thereof, unless the Stock Escrow and Collateral
Agent has actual knowledge of any such lack of authenticity, correctness,
proprietary or validity. The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent may act in
reliance upon any instrument or signature reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and may assume that the person purporting to make any statement or
execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so unless the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent has actual
knowledge of the lack of authority. The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent
may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of any party
hereto which is an entity has full power and authority to instruct the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Agent on behalf of that party unless written notice to
the contrary is delivered to the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent or unless
the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of
power or authority.

the Stock Escrow Fund deposited hereunder and is serving as escrow holder

## (e) The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent (and any successor to the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Agent) may resign at any time upon thirty (30) days
prior notice to the Senior Executives and Parent, and may be removed, with or
without cause, by the consent of the Senior Executives and Parent upon 30
days prior written notice to the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent. Prior to

deliver to the predecessor escrow agent an instrument accepting such
appointment, upon which such successor agent shall, without further act,
become vested with all of the rights, powers and duties of the predecessor
escrow agent as if originally named herein. No such resignation or removal
shall discharge any liability or obligations of the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agent prior to the effective time of such resignation or removal.
If no successor escrow agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
termination or resignation of the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent, the
Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent shall first, place all of the Stock Escrow
Fund at the disposal of a court and petition the court to act as the
successor escrow agent or to appoint another entity to act as the successor
escrow agent and second, if the court does not agree to act as successor
agent or fails to appoint another entity to act as a successor escrow agent,
deposit all of the

       

## Stock Escrow Fund into the registry of any court of competent jurisdiction
and notify Parent and the Senior Executives in writing of such deposit. In
the event that the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent makes a deposit of the
Stock Escrow Fund into the registry of a court in the manner specified in the
preceding sentence, the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent shall thereupon be
discharged from all further duties as the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent
hereunder.  The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent shall have the right to
withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Stock Escrow and Collateral

hereto, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and shall be
reimbursed promptly upon receipt of a written invoice from the Stock Escrow
and Collateral Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made by the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent in
performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of one outside counsel, but not any fees or expenses allocated
to its internal counsel). The Stockholder Representative and the
Senior Executives shall each be responsible for one-half of any such
compensation and reimbursement to which the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent
is entitled.

  

## (g) In connection with any funds transfer, the Stock Escrow and Collateral
Agent may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number
provided by the other parties hereto, pursuant to joint written instructions,
to identify ( _i_ ) the beneficiary, ( _ii_ ) the beneficiarys bank or (

even where its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being
paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank,
or an intermediary bank designated. The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent
shall have no liability with respect to the transfer or distribution of any
funds effected by the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent pursuant to wiring or
transfer instructions provided to the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent by

## All such notices, requests and other communications shall be
deemed received on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received
prior to 5:00 p.m. on a Business Day in the place of receipt. Otherwise, any
such notice, request or communication shall be deemed to have been received
on the next succeeding Business Day in the place of receipt.

  

# 10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (other than
its conflict of law principles to the extent that the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction would be required thereby, but with reference to
Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, which by its terms
applies to this Agreement).

  

# 11. _Security Procedures_ **.** In the event funds transfer instructions
are given  whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, the Stock Escrow
and Collateral Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions
by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule 1
hereto (" _Schedule 1_ "), and the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent may rely
upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons
so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be
changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Stock
Escrow and Collateral Agent. If the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent
is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified in
Schedule 1, the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to [
] or the Senior Executives, (" _Executive Officers_ "). Such Executive

       

# Officer shall deliver to the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent a fully
executed incumbency certificate, and the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer.
The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Parent or the Senior Executive to identify ( _i_ ) the
beneficiary, ( _ii_ ) the beneficiarys bank or ( _iii_ ) an intermediary
bank. The Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent may apply any of the escrowed
funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number,
even when its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being
paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank or
an intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Escrow
Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially
reasonable.

  

# 12. _Enforcement_.

  

## (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in ( _i_ ) the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County and ( _ii_ ) the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  

## (b) The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a)
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (b) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the
purposes of any Action arising out of this Supplemental Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (and each agrees that no such Action
relating to this Supplemental Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought by it except in such courts). The parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of
this Supplemental Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i)
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or (ii) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or that
any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable
judgment against a party hereto in connection with any Action shall be
conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or
judgment.

  

## (c) Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates
to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial

       

## by jury in respect of any Action directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Supplemental Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Each party (a) certifies that no
Representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of an Action, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto
have been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this paragraph.

  

# 13. _Interpretation_. The section headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
meaning or interpretation of any provision hereof. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. Solely as
among the parties hereto other than the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent,
the Merger Agreement, as it may from time to time be amended, shall control
in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with this Agreement.

  

# 14. _Entire Agreement; Modification, Waiver; Counterparts_.  This
Supplemental Agreement constitutes the sole agreement, and supersedes all
prior agreements, understandings and statements, written or oral, between the
parties hereto or any of his respective affiliates and any other person with
respect to the subject matter hereof. The terms of this Supplemental Agreement
may not be modified or otherwise amended, or waived, except pursuant to a
written agreement signed by the parties hereto.  This Supplemental Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

  

# 15. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not
have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of
rendering any other provision or provisions contained herein invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.

  

# 16. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
_provided_ that any assignment, by operation of law or otherwise, by either
party hereto shall require the prior written consent of the other party, and
any purported assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void
and unenforceable.

  

# 17. _Business Day_. If any day specified in this Agreement for the taking
of action by the Stock Escrow and Collateral Agent shall not be a Business
Day, then such action shall be taken on the next succeeding day that is a
Business Day.

       

# 18. _Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Stock Escrow and
Collateral Agent, Parent and the Senior Executives hereby represents
and warrants ( _a_ ) that this Agreement has been duly authorized and
executed and delivered on its behalf and constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligation and ( _b_ ) that the execution and performance of this
Agreement by such person does not and will not violate any applicable Law.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed and delivered this Agreement as
of the date first written above.
