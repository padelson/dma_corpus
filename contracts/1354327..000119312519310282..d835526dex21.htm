($92,000,000) (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ (ii) the amount of any

(iv) Final Transaction Expenses.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall, by wire transfer of immediately

22

    

Section 2.3 _Closing Amounts_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall deliver to Purchaser a statement
(the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith estimate
of and in reasonable detail (i) the Estimated Balance Sheet, (ii) the
Estimated Company Cash, (iii) Estimated Closing Indebtedness (including the
Debt Payoff Amount) and (iv) the Estimated Transaction Expenses. The Parties
will cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to the
Estimated Closing Statement.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, the Closing Statement.

(c) If the Seller Representative disagrees with Purchasers calculation of
the items set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_, the Seller Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery
of the Closing Statement to the Seller Representative, deliver a notice to
Purchaser stating that Sellers disagree with such calculation (such notice,
the " _Objection Notice_ ") and specifying in reasonable detail those items or
amounts as to which the Sellers disagree and the basis therefor. If the
Seller Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with respect
to any item in the Closing Statement within such thirty (30) day period, then
such item in the Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties.

(d) If an Objection Notice is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_,
the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, and Purchaser shall,
during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Company Cash,
the Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses.

(e) If during such period, the Seller Representative and Purchaser are unable
to reach such agreement, then either the Seller Representative or Purchaser
may at any time thereafter request that the Independent Accountant review this
Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating
Closing Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses.
Each of Purchaser and the Seller Representative agrees to execute, if
requested by the Independent Accountant, an engagement letter with
reasonable terms mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Seller
Representative. Purchaser (and Purchaser shall cause the Company to), the
Seller Representative and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Independent
Accountant and promptly provide all documents and information requested by
the Independent Accountant, in each case, that are reasonably available to
that Party (or its independent accountants). In making such calculation, the
Independent Accountant shall be empowered and authorized only to decide
(acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) those items or amounts in the
Closing Statement as to which the Holdcos and the Sellers have disagreed in
their notice of disagreement duly delivered by the Seller Representative
pursuant to  _Section 2.3(c)_, may not assign a value greater than the
greatest positive or negative adjustment requested by the Seller
Representative or Purchaser, and shall not conduct an independent audit or
investigation. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Seller
Representative and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Independent
Accountant), a written report setting forth its calculation of such disputed
amounts. Absent manifest error, such report shall be final and binding upon
the Holdcos, the Sellers and Purchaser, shall be deemed a final arbitration
award that is binding on Purchaser, the Holdcos and the Sellers, and none
of Purchaser, the Holdcos or the Sellers shall seek further recourse to
courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce such report. Judgment may be
entered to enforce such

 



23

    

 report in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the
review and report by the Independent Accountant shall be allocated to and
borne by Purchaser and the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Holdcos
and the Sellers, based on the inverse of the percentage that the Independent
Accountants determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount
of the items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Accountant
(with the determination regarding the allocation of fees and expenses to be
made by the Independent Accountant pursuant to the terms hereof). For example,
should the amount of the items in dispute total $1,000 and the Independent
Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Holdcos and the Sellers position, 60%
of the costs of its review would be borne by Purchaser and 40% of the costs
would be borne by the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Holdcos and the
Sellers. The Independent Accountant and procedures set forth herein shall be
the sole method for resolving any disputes regarding the Purchase Price or the
provisions of this _Section 2.3(e)_.

 

(f) The Sellers, the Holdcos and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective representatives to (and Purchaser shall cause the Company to),
cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the
calculation of Closing Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses and in the conduct of the review referred to in this _Section
2.3_, including by reasonably making available the necessary books, records,
work papers and personnel to the other Parties and the Independent Accountant
in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. Without limiting the foregoing, from
and after the date of the delivery of the Closing Statement until the
resolution of any items objected to by Seller Representative pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, reasonably
make available (at the expense of the Sellers) the Companys contracts, book,
records (including accounting or financial records), work papers, personnel
(including accounting or financial personnel and counsel of the Company) and
advisors and representatives, in each case to the extent relevant to the
verification of the Closing Statement (or the calculation of Closing Company
Cash), to the Seller Representative, its accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives and the Independent Accountant
at reasonable times (during normal business hours and Purchaser shall
cooperate with and provide assistance to, and shall cause the personnel,
advisors and representatives of Purchaser and the Company to reasonably
cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to, the Seller
Representative, its accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives and the Independent Accountant) for the purpose of conducting
the review by the Seller Representative or review by the
Independent Accountant, as applicable, of the Closing Statement (or the
calculation of Closing Company Cash), and the resolution of any disputes
relating thereto.

 

(g) Upon determination of Final Company Cash, the Final Closing Indebtedness
and the Final Transaction Expenses, the following payments shall be made:

(i) If Final Company Cash exceeds the Estimated Company Cash, Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers at the direction of Seller Representative on behalf of the
Holdcos, in the manner provided in _Section 2.3(h)_, the amount of such
excess.

(ii) If Final Company Cash is less than the Estimated Company Cash, the
Sellers shall, or shall cause the Holdcos to, pay to Purchaser, in the manner
provided in _Section 2.3(h)_ and _Section 2.4_, the amount of such
deficiency.

 



24

    

(iii) If the Final Closing Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the Sellers shall, or shall cause the Holdcos to, pay to
Purchaser, in the manner as provided in _Section 2.3(h)_ and _Section 2.4_,
the amount of such excess.

 

(iv) If the Final Closing Indebtedness is less than the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers at the direction of Seller
Representative on behalf of the Holdcos, in the manner as provided in _Section
2.3(h)_, the amount of such deficiency.

 

(v) If the Final Transaction Expenses exceed the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, the Sellers shall, or shall cause the Holdcos to, pay to Purchaser,
in the manner as provided in _Section 2.3(h)_ and _Section 2.4_, the amount
of such excess.

(vi) If the Final Transaction Expenses are less than the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers at the direction of
Seller Representative, in the manner as provided in _Section 2.3(h)_, the
amount of such deficiency.

 

(h) Within five (5) Business Days after each of the Final Company Cash, the
Final Closing Indebtedness and the Final Transaction Expenses have been
determined, as applicable, (i) if the net amount payable pursuant to _Section
2.3(g)_ is owed by Purchaser (such amount, the " _Additional Seller Amount_
"), then Purchaser shall, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
pay to each Seller at the direction of Seller Representative an amount equal
to (A) the Additional Seller Amount _multiplied by_ (B) such Sellers
ownership percentage of Company Holdco and Orlando Holdco as of the Closing
Date, as applicable, and in accordance with the Final Entity Allocation
Statement, and (ii) if the net amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(g)_ is
owed by the Sellers (such amount, the " _Overpayment Amount_ "), then,
subject to _Section 2.4_, (A) Seller Representative, as agent on behalf of
the Sellers, and Purchaser shall jointly first direct and cause the Escrow
Agent to make any such payment to Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement and (B) if the Adjustment Escrow Account is not sufficient to fund
the Overpayment Amount in full, each Seller shall, pay by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser an amount
equal to (1) the Overpayment Amount _minus_ the amount in the foregoing
clause (A) _multiplied by_ (2) such Sellers ownership percentage of Company
Holdco and Orlando Holdco as of the Closing Date, as applicable, and
in accordance with the Final Entity Allocation Statement. All payments under
this _Section 2.3_ shall be without interest, except any amounts not paid
when required by this _Section 2.3_ shall bear interest from the date
due pursuant to this _Section 2.3(h)_ to, and including, the date of
payment, at the Interest Rate. Such interest shall be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

(i) Purchaser shall have no liability or obligation with regard to the
apportionment, allocation, distribution or receipt of the Purchase Price
among the Sellers. In furtherance of the foregoing, except as specifically
contemplated herein, Purchasers payments under _Section 2.2_ and _Section
2.3 _shall completely satisfy and fully discharge Purchasers payment
obligation to all of the Sellers and the Holdcos with respect to the Purchase
Price.

 



25

    

Section 2.4 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) Any payment to be made by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to _Section
2.3(g)_ and _Section 2.3(h)_ shall be paid by release of funds to Purchaser
from the Adjustment Escrow Amount by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall accordingly reduce the Adjustment
Escrow Amount.

 

(b) Upon thirty one (31) days following the date of Purchasers delivery of
the Closing Statement pursuant to  _Section 2.3(b)_, Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to each of the Sellers in
accordance with each such Sellers respective ownership percentage of Company
Holdco and Orlando Holdco as of the Closing Date, as applicable, and in
accordance with the Final Entity Allocation Statement, the Adjustment Escrow
Amount _minus_ (x) any payments that have been made to Purchaser in
accordance with _Section 2.3(g)_ and _Section 2.3(h)_ and (y) any amounts
under dispute according to _Section 2.3(c)_ and _Section 2.3(d)_; _provided_
, the Escrow Agent shall not distribute any amounts out of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount if the amounts in the foregoing clause (y) are equal to or
greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount. If any amount of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount is under dispute according to  _Section 2.3(c)_ and _Section
2.3(d)_, then, upon the resolution of such dispute, Purchaser and Seller
Representative shall promptly and jointly direct the Escrow Agent to
distribute any remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Amount not still under
dispute to each of the Sellers in accordance with each such Sellers
respective ownership percentage of Company Holdco and Orlando Holdco as of the
Closing Date, as applicable, and in accordance with the Final Entity
Allocation Statement.

(c) Any payment to be made by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to _Article
X_ shall be first paid by release of funds to Purchaser or a Purchaser

property locations, including all amendments, extensions and modifications
thereto (collectively, the " _Leases_ "), that any member of the Company Group
currently leases, subleases, licenses or otherwise occupies or uses

has a valid leasehold, subleasehold or license interest in all Leased Real
Property, subject only to Permitted Liens. All Leased Real Property is used
or occupied pursuant to a Lease. Each of such Leases is in full force and
effect and is a valid and binding agreement of such member of the Company
Group and each other party thereto, enforceable against such member of the
Company Group in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by applicable Law and equitable principles. A true, correct and
complete copy of each Lease has been delivered to Purchaser, and no changes
have been made to any Lease since the date of delivery. No member of the
Company Group is, nor is any other party thereto, in breach of or default
under, or has provided or received any written notice of any intention to
terminate or materially modify, any Lease. No event has occurred that (with
notice or lapse of time, or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach or default under any of the Leases by any Person or give any Person the
right to terminate, accelerate or modify any Lease. The Company Group has not
leased or sublet as lessor or sublessor, and no Person (other than the
applicable member of the Company Group) is in possession of any of the Leased

default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter, and (D) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect
to the material breach, default, termination, or repudiation by any party of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any related document. Purchaser shall not
permit, without the prior written consent of Sellers, any amendment or
modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter that (individually or in
the aggregate with any other amendments, modifications, or waivers) would
reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing to an amount that would be less than the amount necessary to fund,
together with cash on hand, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including all fees, costs and expenses to be incurred in connection
therewith), or (y) impose any new or additional condition to the receipt of
any portion of the Debt Financing; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser shall be permitted to amend, restate, replace,
supplement, or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter to (i) correct
typographical errors, or (ii) add lenders, agents, co-agents, arrangers,
bookrunners, managers or other roles under the Debt Commitment Letter or
reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between or
among, any entities party thereto (including replacement of a lender). If any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes, or would reasonably be expected to
become, unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter (after taking into account flex terms) such that the
aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with cash on hand, would
not be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of the payment obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement and in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on terms
that are not less favorable, in any material respect, to Purchaser, with
respect to conditionality and enforcement, than those in the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in an amount sufficient to
replace such portion of the Debt Financing necessary for the satisfaction of
all of the payment obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement and in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event and the provisions of this _Section 7.14_ shall be applicable to the
Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of _Section 6.7_ and this
_Section 7.14_, all references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to
include such Alternative Financing and all references to the Debt Commitment
Letter shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such efforts and any such Alternative
Financing, or the negotiation or implementation thereof, shall not be a
condition to, or justify or excuse any delay in, the performance by Purchaser
of this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Sellers agrees to, and to cause its Affiliates (including the
Company Group) to, use its respective reasonable best efforts to provide such
assistance (and to use its respective reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective personnel and advisors to provide such assistance) with
respect to the Debt Financing as is reasonably requested by Purchaser,
including using reasonable best efforts with respect to:

(i) participation in a reasonable number of drafting sessions, providing

management, representatives and advisors of the Company with appropriate
seniority and expertise available to participate) in a reasonable number of
investor marketing calls and meetings and a reasonable number of due diligence
sessions, presentations, and "road shows" with prospective lenders, investors
and rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing at times and places
reasonably requested by the Debt Financing Sources and reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser cooperating with the Debt Financing Sources and their
respective agents due diligence with respect to the Company Group;

(vi) executing and delivering customary authorization and representation
letters (including customary representations with respect to the accuracy of
the information) for inclusion in any informational materials that authorized
the distribution of information to prospective lenders, and definitive
financing documents to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser, including
certificates, and other documents, to the extent reasonably requested by
Purchaser;

 

(vii) obtaining customary payoff letters and Lien releases in respect of the
Debt Payoff Amount; and

 

(viii) providing customary projected financial information relating only to
the Business as reasonably requested by Purchaser to permit Purchaser to
prepare customary projected financial information relating to Purchaser (to be
prepared on pro forma basis assuming the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it being understood that Sellers need only
provide information to assist in the preparation thereof, and shall not be
required to provide pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments
reflecting the Debt Financing or any description of all or any component of
the Debt Financing) which are customarily required by the Debt Financing
Sources for the syndication of credit facilities similar to those described in
the Debt Commitment Letter.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, none of the Sellers, the
Company, their Affiliates or any of their respective personnel, advisors or
other representatives shall be required prior to the effectiveness of the
acquisition contemplated hereby (1) to pay (or agree to pay) any commitment or
other fee, provide any indemnities, incur any Liability or enter into any
agreement with respect to the Debt Financing or (2) to take any action that
(A) would cause (or reasonably be likely to cause) any condition set forth in
_Article VIII_ to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement, (B) would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate such
Persons Governing Documents or any Law, or result in the material
contravention of, a material violation or breach of, or default under, any
Material Contract (other than any Contract entered into for a purpose of

with the operation of the Business, (D) provide access to or disclose
information that Sellers reasonably determine could jeopardize any attorney-

created in contemplation hereof) applicable to, the Sellers or the
Company, or (E) require Sellers, the Company, or any of their officers or
directors to sign any representation letters (other than the customary
authorization and representation letters referred to in the preceding
paragraph). The governing bodies of the Company Members shall not be required
prior to Closing to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained. None of the
directors, officers, managers, general partners or employees of any Company
Member shall be required to execute any documents relating to the Debt
Financing that are effective prior to the Closing, and none of the directors,
officers, managers, general partners or employees of any Company Member that

of Seller Representative or the Company, reimburse the Sellers, the Company
Group, their Affiliates or any of their respective personnel, advisors or
other representatives for all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs
and expenses (including outside counsel and auditor fees) actually incurred by
them providing the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 7.14_ and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers, the Company, its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, managers, employees, accountants, consultants,

damages actually suffered or incurred by any of them of any type to the
extent resulting from the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 7.14_,
the arrangement of any Debt Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except to the extent that any of the foregoing arises from the

breach of this Agreement by, the Sellers or the Company Group, as applicable.
Each Seller hereby consents to the use of all of the Company Groups logos in
connection with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Sellers or the Company Groups or the reputation or goodwill of the Seller
or the Company Group. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or
in any other agreement between the Sellers and Purchaser (or their respective
Affiliates), the Sellers agree that Purchaser and its Affiliates may share
customary projections with respect to the Company Group with the Debt
Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and that
Purchaser, its Affiliates and such Debt Financing Sources may share such

full force and effect as of the Closing Date.

(b) the breach or violation of any covenant or agreement to be performed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any Purchaser Document.

Section 10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A claim for indemnification under _Article X_ for any matter not involving
a Third Party Claim only may be asserted by written notice (an "
_Indemnification Notice_ ") to (i) __ the Seller Representative, on behalf of
the Holdcos and each of the Sellers, in respect of a claim for which
indemnification is sought under _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, and (ii) __ to
Purchaser, in respect of a claim for which indemnification is sought under
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_, in each case prior to expiration of the applicable
survival period for the representation, warranty, or covenant forming the
basis thereof. Each Indemnification Notice (x) __ must include, in reasonable
detail, the basis for the claim made by the indemnified party, including the
specific section of this Agreement under which the claim is being made and
(y) __provide a non-binding, reasonable estimate of the amounts to which the
indemnified party is entitled. The failure to give written notice shall not,
however, relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification
obligations, unless, and then solely to the extent that, the rights of the
parties from whom indemnity is sought are materially prejudiced as a result of
such failure. The indemnifying party shall have thirty (30) __ days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such claim. If the
indemnifying party does not so respond within such thirty (30) __ day period,
the indemnifying party shall be deemed to have accepted such claim, in which
case the indemnified party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the indemnified party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement and shall promptly pay any amounts owed in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall
promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) __ days after receiving notice
of the Third Party Claim) notify (i) __ the Seller Representative, on behalf
of each of the Holdcos and the Sellers, in respect of a Third Party Claim for
which payment may be sought under  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, and (ii) __to
Purchaser, in respect of a Third Party Claim for which payment may be sought
under _Section_ __ _ 10.3_. The failure of the indemnified party to give
reasonably prompt notice of any such Third Party Claim shall not release,
waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect
thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Without limiting any rights of the
insurer under the RandW Policy, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at
its sole option and expense, to control such Third Party Claim including to be
represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against by it hereunder; _provided_ , that the indemnifying party
shall not have the right to assume control of such defense, if the claim for
which the indemnifying party seeks to assume control: (A) __ seeks non-
monetary, equitable or injunctive relief (except where such relief is merely
incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary damages), (B) involves
criminal allegations, proceedings, indictments or investigations, or (C) __
involves a claim for which, upon petition by the indemnified party, the
appropriate court rules that the indemnifying party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend. If the indemnifying party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against it hereunder, it shall
within thirty (30) __ days notify the indemnified party of its intent to do
so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim at the
indemnifying partys cost and expense.

 

(c) If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the indemnified party may participate (but not control), at his or its
own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that such Person shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if, a conflict
of interest exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
that would make such separate representation advisable (it being understood
that the existence of a dispute as to whether the indemnified party is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall not constitute grounds

 



77

    

 for conflict) or a Third Party Claim seeks nonmonetary relief which, if
granted, could materially and adversely affect the indemnified party or its
affiliates (and in such case the indemnified party may elect to assume such
defense); _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying parties shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third Party Claim; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
fees, costs and expenses of one such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are
both named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have
reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them. The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ to the contrary, the
indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant unconditionally releases
the indemnified party from all Liability with respect to such Third Party
Claim and no additional obligation, restriction or Losses shall be imposed on
the indemnified party other than solely the payment of money damages for which
the indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of such Person __ s willingness to accept the
settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of _Section_ __ _
10.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, pay the amount called for by such offer, and
the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party
may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by
the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate Liability with respect
to such Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to
pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) __ the amount of the
settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept plus the Losses
of the indemnified party relating to such Third Party Claim for which the
indemnified party is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Article X_
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate
Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter. If the indemnifying
party makes any payment on any claim for indemnification, the indemnifying
party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and
remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of
the indemnified party with respect to such claim.

(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.5_, any Losses payable by the Sellers to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ shall be
satisfied solely and exclusively as follows:

(i) With respect to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ other than Fraud, (A) __
first, from the Retention Escrow Amount, to the extent of the amounts
remaining therein and up to the Cap and (B) __ second, from the RandW Policy, 
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Seller shall have any
Liability for any such Losses in excess of the Retention Escrow Amount, and a
Purchaser Indemnified Partys sole source of recovery for such Losses that
exceed the Escrow Amount shall be the RandW Policy; and

 



78

    

(ii) with respect to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(ii)_ other than Fraud, (A) __
first, from the Retention Escrow Amount, to the extent of the amounts
remaining therein, (B) __ second, from the RandW Policy (to the extent
available); _provided_ , _however_ , that, so long as Purchaser or
the appropriate Purchaser Indemnified Party has first made such a claim under
the RandW Policy, Purchaser or such Purchaser Indemnified Party may also make a
claim against the Sellers for indemnification under  _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)_, notwithstanding the fact that the Purchaser Indemnified Partys
claim under the RandW Policy is still pending, and (C) __ third, from the
applicable Seller up to the remaining Liability of such Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.5_, as applicable. __

(f) Subject to _Section 10.5_, any Losses payable by the Sellers to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2(f) _shall be satisfied
solely and exclusively against the [***] Escrow Amount.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, claims under _Section 10.2(b)_ , _Section
10.2(c)_ , _Section 10.2(d)_ or _Section 10.2(e)_  shall be brought directly
against the Retention Escrow Amount and the applicable Sellers.

Section 10.5 _Certain Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding the
other provisions of this _Article X_ :

(a) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)_, (i) the Sellers shall
not have any indemnification obligations for Losses under _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of all Losses relating thereto for
which the Sellers would be liable exceeds the Deductible, and then only to
the extent of such excess and (ii) __ Purchaser shall not have any
indemnification obligations for Losses under _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_ unless
the aggregate amount of all Losses relating thereto for which Purchaser would
be liable exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent such excess.
Except as set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)_, in no event shall the aggregate indemnification for
which the Sellers are obligated under _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ or for which
Purchaser is obligated under _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_, in each case, exceed
the Cap.

 

(b) The Cap and Deductible limitations shall not apply to breaches or
inaccuracies of the Seller Fundamental Representations or in the case
of Fraud in respect of _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(i)_ _._

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary but subject to the joint
and several Liability as between the Rahn Sellers and joint and several
Liability as between the Ochstein Sellers, in no event shall either the Rahn
Sellers or the Ochstein Sellers have any Liability, obligation, or
responsibility (A) __ for any amount in excess of the portion of the
Purchase Price actually paid to the members of the Rahn Sellers or the
Ochstein Sellers, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, (B) __ with
respect to a breach of any covenant on the part of the Ochstein Seller or the
Rahn Seller (other than breaches of covenants by the Company), respectively or
(C) __ for any claim for indemnification under this _Article X_ in respect of
any matter that is taken into account in the Financial Statements or any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Purchaser have any
Liability, obligation or responsibility for any amount under this Agreement
in excess of the Purchase Price actually paid to the Sellers.

 



79

    

(d) No Seller shall have any right of contribution, set off or indemnity or
other right or remedy against any member of the Company Group or its
Affiliates in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other
Liability to which such Seller may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement.

 

Section 10.6 _Calculation of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article X_ shall be:

 

(i) net of any Tax Benefit actually realized by the indemnified party as a
cash reduction. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean, with
respect to any Loss subject to indemnity under this _Article X_ , an amount by
which the Tax Liability of a Party (or a group of corporations filing a Tax
Return that includes such Party), with respect to the taxable year in which
such Loss occurs or with respect to the immediately succeeding taxable year,
is actually reduced solely as a result of such Loss or the amount of any Tax
refund that is generated solely as a result of such Loss, and any related
interest received from any relevant Taxing Authority; and

(ii) net of amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party from any
Collateral Source. Except as required by any RandW Policy, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that no right of subrogation shall accrue or inure to
the benefit of any Collateral Source hereunder and Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the insurers of any Purchaser
Indemnified Party to waive subrogation against the Sellers. No Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be required to first seek recovery from an insurer or
any other Person prior to seeking and obtaining recovery from the
Indemnifying Party. If any recovery is made subsequent to indemnification by
the Sellers, then Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Purchaser
Indemnified Party to, reimburse the Sellers for the amount paid by such Seller
therefor to the extent of such recovery.

(b) For the sole purposes of determining the amount of any Losses and for
determining whether or not any breach of a representation or warranty has
occurred, the representations and warranties of the Sellers shall not be
deemed qualified by any references to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar concept.

 

(c) Any Liability for indemnification under this _Article X_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

Section 10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Fraud, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach, violation, inaccuracy or
failure to be true or correct, or alleged breach, violation, inaccuracy or
failure to be true or correct, of any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement (including any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)(v)_), shall be
indemnification in accordance with this _Article X_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ shall not (a) apply to claims for
specific performance or (b) operate to interfere with or impede the operation
of the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ providing for the resolution of
certain disputes relating to the Closing Statement.

 



80

    

Section 10.8 _Offset / Set Off_. Except in connection with the RandW
Policy, neither the Sellers, the Holdcos, nor Purchaser shall have any right
to offset or set off any payment due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ against any other payment to be made under any Company
Documents, Purchaser Documents or Seller Documents (other than any other
payment due under _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.3_) or otherwise
(including against indemnification).

 

Section 10.9 _Knowledge_. The right to indemnification, payment of Losses of
an indemnified party or for other remedies based on any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of an indemnifying party contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by (a) any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired), by such indemnified party with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or (b) the waiver of any condition in this Agreement based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement.

Section 10.10 _R andW Policy_. The RandW Policy is a Contract between Purchaser
and the insurers party thereto separate and apart from this Agreement. As
such, none of the limitations or exceptions set forth in this Article X and
this Agreement shall in any way limit, affect, restrict, modify or impair the
ability of Purchaser to make claims under or recover under the RandW Policy.

ARTICLE XI 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 11.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. The Parties shall, unless prohibited by
applicable Law, close the taxable period of the members of the Company Group
as of the end of the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit such
closing of a taxable period, then in the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date and
ending after the Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "),
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall: (i) __ in the case of Taxes that are
based upon income, receipts, transactions or payroll, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable as determined based upon an interim closing of
the books as if the taxable period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) __ in
the case of any other Taxes (such as property taxes) be deemed equal to the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)_, any item determined on an annual or
periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) for
income Tax purposes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the relative number of calendar days in
such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of calendar
days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



81

    

(b) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_. The Holdcos and the Sellers shall file, or
cause to be filed, on a timely basis, all Tax Returns with respect to members
of the Company Group that are required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date (taking into account extensions). With respect to Tax Returns of members
of the Company Group for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (each a " _Reviewable Tax
Return_ ") that are due after the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions) __ (i) the Seller Representative (at the sole cost of
the Holdcos and the Sellers) shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all Tax Returns for Tax Periods that end on or before the Closing
Date and (ii) __ Purchaser (at its sole cost) shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for Straddle Periods. All
Reviewable Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practices of the applicable member of the Company Group (except as otherwise
required by Tax Law). As between the Seller Representative and Purchaser, the
Party having the right pursuant to this _Section 11.1(b)_ to prepare a
Reviewable Tax Return (the " _Preparing Party_ ") shall deliver the Reviewable
Tax Return to the other party (the " _Reviewing Party_ ") for the Reviewing
Partys review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) at least thirty (30) __ calendar days (or in the case of any such
Tax Return that is not an income Tax Return, as soon as practical) prior to
the date any such Reviewable Tax Return is filed. The Reviewing Party shall
provide written comments to each Reviewable Tax Return within fifteen (15) __
calendar days (or in the case of any such Tax Return that is not an income
Tax Return, as soon as practical) of having received (or in the case of any
such Tax Return that is not an income Tax Return, as soon as practical after
receiving) such Tax Return. The Preparing Party shall consider any such
changes to each Reviewable Tax Return as are timely requested by the Reviewing
Party and shall provide an updated version of such Tax Return reflecting any
resolutions in respect of the requested changes to the Reviewing Party
at least ten (10) __ calendar days prior (or in the case of any such Tax
Return that is not an income Tax Return, as soon as practical) to the filing
of such Tax Return. If the Preparing Party does not accept all of the
Reviewing Partys written comments with respect to such Reviewable Tax
Return, the Reviewing Party and the Preparing Party shall negotiate in good
faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such disagreement. If
the Reviewing Party and the Preparing Party are unable to reach such
agreement within five calendar days prior to the due date (inclusive of
extensions) for such Tax Return, the disputed items shall be submitted to the
Independent Accountant solely for resolution of the disputed items
in accordance with this Agreement applying the principles set forth in
___Section 2.3(e)_ to determine whether such Reviewable Tax Return has been
prepared in accordance with this Agreement. Any determination by the
Independent Accountant shall be final. The Seller Representative and
Purchaser shall use their best efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to
resolve any disputed items promptly pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. If the Independent Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed
items before the due date for such Reviewable Tax Return, such Tax Return
shall be filed as prepared (and to the extent agreed to by the parties) and
then amended to reflect the Independent Accountants resolution. The costs,
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and the Sellers. The Sellers, the Holdcos, the Company, NewSouth
Orlando and each other member of the Company Group agree to take no
position on any Tax Return, in any Tax proceeding or otherwise, to the effect
that the Pre-Closing Reorganizations are other than F reorganizations pursuant
to Code Section __ 368(a)(1)(F).

 



82

    

Section 11.2 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Sellers, the Holdcos and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause
the members of the Company Group to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ and any Legal Proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Partys request and expense) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Legal Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(b) The Sellers, the Holdcos and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause
the members of the Company Group to, upon request, use their reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

Section 11.3 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund (or credit in lieu thereof) for
overpayment of Taxes due to a member of the Company Group with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days after such
refund (or credit in lieu thereof) has been received in cash (or such credit
has reduced cash Tax otherwise due) by Purchaser, a member of the Company
Group or their Affiliates be paid to the Seller Representative. Any Tax refund
(or credit in lieu thereof) to which the Sellers are entitled pursuant to
this section shall include any interest paid thereon by the applicable
Governmental Authority. Purchaser will, if the Seller Representative so
requests and at the Sellers sole cost and expense, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the members of the Company Group to file for and
prosecute any claim for Tax refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) to which the
Sellers are entitled hereunder. Purchaser will keep the Seller Representative
reasonably appraised of the material facts of any such prosecution of claim.

Section 11.4 _Other Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall not cause or permit (and shall preclude each member of the
Company Group from causing or permitting) __ (i) the filing or amendment of
any Tax Return of a member of the Company Group for a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(ii) __ the making or changing of any Tax election (other than an election
that is contemplated by this Agreement) that would adversely affect the
Sellers, (iii) __ an extension, a consent to extension or waiver of the
statute of limitation for any a Pre-Closing Tax Period relating to Tax, (iv)
__ engaging in any voluntary disclosure or similar proceeding with a
Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of a member of the
Company Group for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (v) __ the carryback of an
item on the Tax Return of a member of the Company Group for a Post-Closing Tax
Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without the prior written
consent of the Seller Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such action by Purchaser or the
applicable member of the Company Group would not result in any Tax Liability
(or reduction to a Tax refund or credit benefit) to the Sellers or any
Affiliate thereof.

 



83

    

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ to the
contrary, if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any member of the
Company Group) receives written notice (including a written threat by any
Governmental Authority) of any Tax Matter or other administrative, judicial,
or other proceeding by, or against or with respect to Taxes (or relating to a
Tax refund or credit benefit) of any member of the Company Group for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (collectively, a " _Tax Contest_ "), Purchaser shall
within ten calendar days after such receipt, provide written notice thereof to
the Seller Representative if such Tax Contest could result in any Indemnified
Taxes or a Tax refund or credit benefit. Purchaser shall have the right to
control at its cost all actions relating to Taxes and to settle, compromise
or litigate all Tax matters relating to a member of the Company Group, except
if Sellers reasonably could be expected to have Liability for Indemnified
Taxes or be entitled to a Tax refund or credit in lieu thereof, then (i) __
notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_,
the Seller Representative shall have exclusive right to control all actions
relating to such Tax Contest and such Taxes for Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (and Purchaser has the right to participate at its
cost in such Tax Contest), and (ii) __ the Seller Representative shall have
the right to participate at its cost in such Tax Contest that relates to a
Straddle Period. No party shall settle or compromise any Tax Contest described
in clause (i) __ or (ii) of the immediately prior sentence without the other
partys written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. No claim in respect of Taxes that may subject Sellers
to Liability for Indemnified Taxes (or entitle Sellers to a Tax refund or the
benefit of a credit) shall be subject to any of the limitations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.4_ and in the event of a conflict, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_ shall control.

 

(c) To the maximum extent possible under Tax Law and to the extent such items
are directly or indirectly paid or deemed paid or accrued by Sellers or a
member of the Company Group on or before the Closing Date, any Tax deductions
with respect to the payment or accrual of the Transaction Expenses or
Indebtedness shall be deducted by the applicable members of the Company Group
in the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period.

Section 11.5 _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer,
intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of any
nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Sellers on the
one hand and Purchaser on the other hand.

 

Section 11.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_. ____

 

(a) Within 15 Business Days after the date hereof, Purchaser shall in good
faith prepare and deliver to Seller Representative a schedule (the "
_Preliminary Entity Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the Purchase Price
between Company Holdco and Orlando Holdco. After the date of delivery by
Purchaser of the Preliminary Entity Allocation Statement to Seller
Representative, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall take no more than
10 Business Days to finalize and agree to the final allocation of the Purchase
Price between Company Holdco and Orlando Holdco (the " _Final Entity
Allocation Statement_ "). In the event that the Purchaser and Seller
Representative cannot agree to a Final Entity Allocation Statement by the date
that is 25 Business Days after the date hereof, Purchaser and Seller
Representative shall follow procedures consistent with those provided for in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ (related to the determination of items in the
Estimated Closing Statement) to engage an Independent Accountant to review and
revise the Preliminary Entity Allocation Statement and provide the Final
Entity Allocation Statement. The decisions of the Independent Accountant shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Purchaser and Seller Representative except
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ _._

 



84

    

(b) Within 30 Business Days after the Closing Date, the Seller Representative
shall provide to Purchaser for review and approval two schedules (each an "
_Asset Allocation Statement_ " and together the " _Asset Allocation
Statements_ "), (i) one allocating the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to Company Holdco (along with any assumed liabilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and other amounts required to be taken into account for
income Tax purposes as consideration for the Company Membership Interests that
are not already taken into account in the Purchase Price) (the " _Company
Allocable Price_ ") among the assets of the Company (excluding the equity
interests of the Company Subsidiaries owned by the Company) and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the Closing; and (ii) the other allocating the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to Orlando Holdco (along with any assumed
liabilities of NewSouth Orlando and other amounts required to be taken into
account for income Tax purposes as consideration for the Orlando Membership
Interests that are not already taken into account in the Purchase Price) (the
" _Orlando Allocable Price_ ") among the assets of NewSouth Orlando as of the
Closing. The Asset Allocation Statements shall be prepared consistent with
the methodology set forth on _Exhibit VII_ and shall allocate the Company
Allocable Price and the Orlando Allocable Price only to the asset classes
provided for in _Exhibit VII_ and Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6 (and not
to specific assets within each asset class).

(c) Upon the payment of any adjustments to the final Purchase Price, the
Final Entity Allocation Statement and the Asset Allocation Statements shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such payments. Purchaser, its Affiliates,
the members of the Company Group and the Sellers (each, a " _Tax Filing
Party_ ") shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the Final Entity
Allocation Statement and the Asset Allocation Statements. None of the Tax
Filing Parties shall take any Tax position inconsistent with the Final Entity
Allocation Statement or the Assets Allocation Statements or agree to any
proposed adjustment to the Final Entity Allocation Statement or the Asset
Allocation Statements by any Taxing Authority without first giving the other
Tax Filing Parties prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall prevent a Tax Filing Party from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based upon or arising out of
the Final Entity Allocation Statement or the Asset Allocation Statements, and
no Tax Filing Party shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging the
Final Entity Allocation Statement or the Asset Allocation Statements

Section 12.2 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process;
Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided for herein, the Parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court located in Tampa,
Florida or state court located in Hillsborough County, Florida over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding
related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any

the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a judgment in
any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served by any Party
to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery of a copy

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OR IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY
OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
Parties on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates hereby: (i) agrees
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources, arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court
thereof and each party irrevocably submits itself and its property with
respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court, (ii) agrees that any such Legal Proceeding shall be governed by the
Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of
another state), (iii) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its
affiliates to bring or support any Legal Proceeding, including any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or
any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the

 



86

    

 performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than any federal
or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (iv)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Legal Proceeding
in any such court and (v) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law trial by jury in any Legal
Proceeding brought against the Debt Financing Sources in any way arising out
of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder.

 

Section 12.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers; Exclusivity of
Agreement; Specific Performance._

 

(a) This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto), the Seller
Documents, the Company Documents, the Purchaser Documents and
the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding and
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and, subject to _Section 7.5_, supersede all prior understandings and
agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such matters.

(b) This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision
hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to
this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
Party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein. No failure on the part of any Party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of _Section 10.7_, _Section
12.2(d)_, this _Section 12.3_, _Section 12.6_, _Section 12.8_ and _Section
12.9(b)_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver, supplement or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of any of such Sections) may be amended in any manner that is
adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

(c) The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, Liabilities
and obligations respecting the subject matter of this Agreement exclusively
in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement;
and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties not expressly
set forth in this Agreement.

 

(d) Except to the extent set forth otherwise in this Agreement (including in
_Section 10.07_), all remedies under this Agreement expressly conferred upon
a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
Each Party acknowledges that the Parties will be irreparably harmed and that
there will be no adequate remedy at law for any violation by any Party of any
of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. Therefore, in
addition to any other remedies which may be available upon the breach of any
such covenants or agreements, each of Purchaser

 



87

    

 and Sellers (on behalf of itself and the Holdcos) shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other Party and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. No Party or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond
or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 12.3(d)_, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument. Subject to and without limiting the
rights arising under _Section 9.1_, each Party further agrees not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement identified above in this _Section 12.3(d)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, upon a valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article IX_ , no Party shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to consummate the Closing.

Section 12.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory) that may be based
upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, or any matter which is the subject of this
Agreement, including the validity hereof and the rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Florida applicable to contracts negotiated, made
and performed in such State without giving effect to the choice of law
principles of such state that would require or permit the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 12.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, consents and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given (i) when delivered personally by hand (with written confirmation of
receipt), (ii) when sent by email (receipt confirmed) or (iii) one Business
Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of
receipt), in each case at the following addresses (or to such other address as

Section 12.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding anything
contrary to the foregoing, if any covenant in _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ is held to
be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, such covenant will be
considered to be divisible with respect to scope, time, and geographic area,
and such lesser scope, time, or geographic area, or all of them, as a court of
competent jurisdiction may determine to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and not
against public policy, will be effective, binding, and enforceable against
any Seller.

Section 12.7 _Conflicts, Privilege and Seller Communications_. Purchaser and
the Company Group agree that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Company Group by Foley and Lardner LLP (" _Foley_ "),
Foley shall be allowed to represent any Seller or any of their Affiliates in
any matters or disputes that arises in the future and relates to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and Purchaser and the
Company Group hereby (i) waive any claim they have or may have that Foley has
a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation on the ground that Foley represented Seller in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and (ii) agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser, the
Company Group and any Seller or any of their Affiliates, Foley may represent
such Seller or Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such
Seller or Affiliate may be directly adverse to Purchaser or the Company Group
unless Foley is representing or has represented the Company Group in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Purchaser and the Company Group also
further agree that, (x) as to all communications among Foley and the Company
Group, the Holdcos, the Sellers and their Affiliates that relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers and may be
controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or
the Company Group and (y) as to all communications among the Company Group,
the Holdcos, the Sellers and their Affiliates (including communications with
other advisors) that relate to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, such communications belong to the Sellers and may be controlled by
the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Company
Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Purchaser, the Company Group and a third party other than a Party to
this Agreement after the Closing, the Company Group may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Foley
to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Group may not
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative.

 

Section 12.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to this
Agreement except as set forth in _Article X_ ; _provided_ that the Debt
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of and shall be
entitled to rely upon

 



90

    

 and may enforce _Section 10.7_, _Section 12.2(d)_, this _Section 12.3_,
_Section 12.6_, this _Section 12.8_ and _Section 12.9_(b). No assignment
of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by
either the Sellers, the Holdcos, the Company Group or Purchaser, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other Parties and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void; provided that Purchaser may assign its rights
but not its obligation under this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source or
its Affiliate (but in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate, so long as
Purchaser remains responsible for all of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement notwithstanding such). No assignment of any obligations hereunder
shall relieve the Parties of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to
any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 

Section 12.9 _Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) This Agreement may only be enforced against the named Parties. Following
the Closing, (i) all claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement may be made only against the entities that are
expressly identified as Parties hereto and (ii) except as expressly
provided hereunder, no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any Party (including any Person negotiating or executing
this Agreement on behalf of a Party) shall have any Liability or obligation
with respect to this Agreement or with respect any claim or cause of action
that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
no Debt Financing Source shall have any Liability, whether by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
applicable Law, for any obligations or Liabilities of the Parties or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith (including any dispute arising out
of, or relating in any way to, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby) and (ii) none of
the Company Group, the Holdcos, the Sellers, Purchaser or any Affiliate of any
of the foregoing shall be entitled to seek specific performance of any rights
of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to cause the Debt Financing to be
funded; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
12.9(b)_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement or under the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Debt Financing Sources obligations to Purchaser under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 

Section 12.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile, e-mail or other electronic
transmission), each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail
or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same
legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement. At the
request of any Party, the other Parties shall re-execute an original form of
this Agreement and deliver it to the requesting Party. No Party shall raise
the use of facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission or
similar format to deliver a signature page as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.

 



91

    

Section 12.11 _Seller Representative._

 

(a) Without any further action by the Holdcos or the Sellers, each of the
Sellers and the Holdcos hereby agree and acknowledge that
Seller Representative is hereby appointed as the representative and agent on
behalf of the Holdcos and each of the Sellers, with exclusive authority to
make all decisions and determinations and to take all actions (including
giving consents and waivers to this Agreement) required or permitted
hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement and under the Company Documents and the
Seller Documents on behalf of the Holdcos and the Sellers, and any such
action, decision or determination so made or taken shall be deemed the
action, decision or determination of the Holdcos and the Sellers, and any
notice, document, certificate or information required to be given to the
Holdcos or any Seller shall be deemed so given if given to the Seller
Representative. The Seller Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller Representatives
powers and authority shall include, without limitation, acting in the name of
and on behalf of the Holdcos and the Sellers with respect to:

(i) the execution, delivery, receipt and acceptance of delivery of, such
notices, releases, instruments and other documents as the Seller
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, to be appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
Documents, and the Seller Documents;

 

(ii) providing the calculations contemplated by _Article II_ of this
Agreement;

 

(iii) the investigation, prosecution, defense and/or settlement of any claims
pursuant to _Article X_ of this Agreement, or otherwise related to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any Company Document, any Seller Document or
the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

(iv) making all decisions in connection with any amendment to this Agreement
or any other document related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Each Seller and Holdco, for itself and its successors and assigns,
together with, in the case of any Seller that is an individual, his heirs and
personal representatives, hereby constitutes and appoints the Seller
Representative as its attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, with
full power and authority to perform any action described above in the
foregoing provisions or this _Section 12.11_, it being understood that the
foregoing power of attorney shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and
shall survive the death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other
termination of any Seller or any Holdco. The appointment of the Seller
Representative as each Sellers attorney-in-fact revokes any power of
attorney heretofore granted that authorized any other Person to represent such
Seller with regard to this Agreement, the Company Documents and the Seller
Documents. Each Seller shall promptly provide written notice to the Seller
Representative of any change of address of such Seller.

 



92

    

(c) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Seller Representative
taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the Seller
Representative pursuant to this _Section 12.11_ shall be final, conclusive
and binding upon the Holdcos and all Sellers. The power and authority of the
Seller Representative as described in this Agreement shall continue in full
force until all rights and obligations of the Holdcos and the Sellers under
this Agreement, any Company Document and any Seller Document shall have
terminated, expired or been fully performed.

 

(d) Purchaser, its Affiliates and, after the Closing, the Company Group, shall
be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions, decisions and actions
of the Seller Representative in all matters in which action by the Seller
Representative is required or permitted, or otherwise contemplated to be taken
by, the Seller Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
any Company Document or any Seller Document, and Purchaser, its Affiliates
and, after the Closing, the Company Group are hereby released and relieved
from any Liability to any Person for (i) any acts or omissions by any of them
in accordance with any instructions (including payment instructions),
decisions or acts of the Seller Representative and (ii) any instructions,
decisions or actions of the Seller Representative in all matters in which
action by the Seller Representative is required or permitted, or otherwise
contemplated to be taken by, the Seller Representative under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, any Company Document or any Seller Document.

 

(e) The Sellers shall severally (based on each Sellers Indemnification
Percentage) but not jointly (i) indemnify the Seller Representative and hold
the Seller Representative harmless against any loss, Liability, damage, cost
or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
of the Seller Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance, administration or performance of the Seller Representatives
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel or other advisors reasonably retained by the Seller Representative,
and (ii) pay all fees and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in
performing its duties. No Seller shall have any Liability or obligation under
this _Section 12.11_ in excess of an amount equal to such Sellers
Indemnification Percentage of any amounts due under this _Section 12.11_.

(f) In the event that the Seller Representative becomes unable to perform
the Seller Representatives responsibilities or resigns from such position,
the Sellers that collectively have Indemnification Percentages greater than
50% shall select another representative to fill such vacancy. At any time, the
Sellers that collectively have Indemnification Percentages greater than 50%
can select another representative. Any such substituted representative shall
(i) be deemed to be the Seller Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement and (ii) exercise the rights and powers or, and be entitled to the
indemnity, reimbursement and other benefits of, the Seller Representative. The
Sellers (or the successor Seller Representative, acting on behalf of the
Sellers) shall provide written notice to Purchaser of the selection of each
successor Seller Representative as promptly as practicable following such
selection.
