Section 2.01 Pre-Closing Reorganization.

(a)Prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company shall take, or cause to be
taken, such actions as may be necessary to effect the business division
reorganization transactions described on Appendix 2.01(a) and Appendix 2.01(b)
attached hereto (such transactions, collectively, the "Corporate
Reorganization"). Seller and Parent shall indemnify Purchaser pursuant to
Section 9.02(g) and the other provisions of Article 9 for any Liability
(including any Liability for Tax, determined on a with or without basis taking
into account any applicable deductions, losses or Tax attributes available to
the Company Entities) or expense to the Company Entities other than any such
Liabilities or expenses that are paid prior to the Closing or otherwise
included in the final calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Costs and the
Allocated Reorganization Expense Amount (such Liabilities and expenses,
including any Liabilities and expenses resulting from the failure to complete
the Corporate Reorganization in accordance with the terms hereof, being
referred to herein as the "Corporate Reorganization Liabilities"). (For the
avoidance of doubt, indirect effects, such as changes in profitability or the
Tax profiles of the Company Entities, shall not be considered adverse Tax
liabilities, or liabilities or expenses.) Seller shall consult with Purchaser
on a regular basis (including by providing twice-monthly status updates and
reasonably prompt notice of any material developments in connection with the
Corporate Reorganization) and the parties shall cooperate in good faith with
each other in connection with the Corporate Reorganization, and Seller shall
not (i) assign or contribute any Liabilities to the Company Entities not
explicitly required by the terms of the Corporate Reorganization, or (ii)
enter into any Contract implementing, or in connection with, the Corporate
Reorganization (other than Contracts (x) in substantially the form of the
Exhibits to this Agreement or (y) that are not binding on a Company Entity),
in each case without the prior written consent of Purchaser (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller may not modify
the transactions set forth on Appendix 2.01(a) and Appendix 2.01(b) in any
material respect, or in a manner that would create any Liability or expense to
Purchaser or a Company Entity, in each case absent the prior written consent
of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete (or
cause to be completed) the Corporate Reorganization as promptly as reasonably
practicable. 

(b)Prior to the Closing, and in any event promptly following the delivery of
same to the applicable Governmental Entities as part of the Corporation
Reorganization, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the report of an independent
qualified third party appraiser (x) as required by applicable Law in
connection with the Corporate Reorganization) regarding the fair market value
of (i) Astec Electronics (Luoding) Company Limited at the time of its
contribution or sale to Consumer Holdco II Limited by Astec International
Limited and (ii) the Cavite, Philippines facility improvements and (y)
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) regarding any other assets divested from the Company
Entities having a net book value of $500,000 or more, including equity
interests in Consumer HK Holdco Limited and EC Holdco, Inc. (as identified on
Appendix 2.01(a)), as well as any significant Contracts as reasonably agreed
between the Parties. Such third party appraiser's determination of such fair
market values shall be final and binding on the parties (but shall be
superseded by any final determination of any Governmental Entity).

(c)Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser Seller's estimate
of, in reasonable detail, (i) the gain, if any, that it expects each Company
Entity to report (including in any consolidated Tax Return) for federal,
state, local, or foreign income Tax purposes as a result of the Corporate
Reorganization, utilizing where applicable the fair market values determined
in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (ii) the federal, state, local, and
foreign income and transfer Taxes (if any) that it expects the Company
Entities to incur as a result of the Corporate Reorganization, (iii) the NOL
Carryforwards and Seller Business Interest Expense Carryforward Deductions.

Section 2.02 Purchase and Sale of the Shares. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase from

Liens, in exchange for Four Hundred Million Dollars ($400,000,000.00) in cash
(the "Base Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment at and after the Closing as
provided in this Agreement (as so adjusted from time to time, the "Purchase
Price").

Section 2.03 The Closing.

(a)The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares (the "Closing") shall
take place by electronic exchange of executed documents or, if mutually agreed
by the parties, at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, LLP, 600 Anton
Boulevard, 18th Floor, Costa Mesa, California, in either case, at 10:00 a.m.

waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby occurs (other than any such conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied concurrently with the Closing), or at
such other time and date as Purchaser and Seller may mutually agree (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, the Closing
Date shall (i) be no earlier than the date that is thirty (30) days following
the date of this Agreement and (ii) not occur during any applicable Interim
Breach Review Period or Interim Breach Standstill Period, in each case absent
the written agreement of Purchaser and Seller. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date".

(b)At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, or cause to be delivered
to Purchaser, in each case, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, (i) the certificate referred to in Section 7.02(c), (ii) the
certificate(s) representing the Shares, duly endorsed for transfer to
Purchaser or accompanied by duly executed assignment documentation, 

(iii) the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by Seller, (iv) each of the
Restrictive Covenants Agreements, duly executed by the Company and the
applicable counterparty party thereto, (v) each of the Subleases, duly
executed by the applicable Company Entity and the applicable Retained
Subsidiary party thereto, (vi) each of the Trademark License Agreements, duly

pay-off letter with respect to the payoff amounts of the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness from the Company Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement (a
"Pay-Off Letter") stating the dollar amount required to repay in full all
Indebtedness owed to such Company Lender as of the Closing Date (the "Debt
Payoff Amount") and providing that, upon payment of such amount, all claims of
such lender in and to the properties and assets of the Company Entities will
be terminated and that such lender shall execute and deliver to Purchaser all
terminations and releases (including UCC-3 termination statements) necessary
to evidence such termination.

(d)At or immediately following the Closing, Seller shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to the Company, to the extent not already in the Company's
possession or control, each of the original board of director and stockholder
minute books, Organizational Documents and stock ledger records (or
equivalent, in each case) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e)At the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) deliver to Seller the certificate
referred to in Section 7.03(c), (ii) pay to Seller (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the amount equal to the Base Purchase Price, as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.04(b), less the Escrow Amount and less the
Holdback Amount, (iii) deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount to be
held under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (iv) pay, on behalf and at the
direction of the Seller, the applicable Debt Payoff Amount to the Company
Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement, and (v) pay, on behalf and at the
direction of the Seller, the applicable portion of the Closing Company
Transaction Costs that are to be paid at the Closing to the applicable third
party recipients thereof (other than in respect of payments to employees of
the Company Entities, which are the subject matter of Section 2.03(f)). All
payments made by Purchaser to or at the direction of Seller under this
Agreement shall be made without withholding, deduction or set-off against the
Purchase Price, except that Taxes may be withheld to the extent required by
applicable Law; provided, that if Purchaser believes that it is required to
make any Tax withholding required by applicable Law in connection with a
payment under this Agreement (other than with respect to any compensatory
payment made to an employee of a Company Entity), it shall first provide
written notice of such belief, in reasonable detail, to the payee at least
three (3) Business Days in advance of the date of payment and the parties will
work together reasonably and in good faith to minimize or eliminate, as
permitted under applicable Law, the obligation to make such Tax withholding in
connection with such payment (by, for example, delivery of FIRPTA, W-8 BEN or
similar certificates, as applicable).

(f)Immediately following the Closing, and in any event no later than the first
to occur of five (5) days following the Closing and the first regularly
scheduled payroll date of the Company Entities, or if a later payment date is
permitted pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing the obligation to
make such payment(s), the date identified by Seller that is within sixty (60)
days following the Closing Date and so permitted pursuant to such governing
terms, Purchaser 

shall cause the applicable Company Entities to pay to the intended recipients
thereof, on behalf of and at the direction of the Seller (which direction
(including payment dates) Seller shall provide in writing in connection with
the delivery of the estimates contemplated by Section 2.04(b) below), the
portion of the Closing Company Transaction Costs to be paid to Continuing
Employees in connection with the Closing, in each case less any applicable
withholding Taxes and utilizing the applicable Company Entity's payroll
systems, and in each case with the agreement and understanding that all Seller
Tax Deductions associated with the payment of such amounts shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 6.06(b).

(g)All acts and proceedings to be taken and all documents to be executed and
delivered by the parties at the Closing shall be deemed to have been taken and
executed simultaneously, and, except as permitted hereunder, no acts or
proceedings in connection with the Closing shall be deemed taken nor any
documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and
delivered.

Section 2.04 Holdback; Adjustment to Purchase Price.

(a)At the Closing, Purchaser shall, as provided in clause (ii) of Section
2.03(e), withhold from the Base Purchase Price payable pursuant to this
Agreement and retain an amount in cash in available funds equal to the
Holdback Amount to secure the adjustment obligations of the Seller pursuant to
this Section 2.04. The Holdback Amount shall be held by Purchaser and
disbursed by it solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

(b)At least two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting forth (1) the Company's good faith estimate of Closing Net
Working Capital ("Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), Closing Cash
("Estimated Closing Cash"), Closing Indebtedness, which shall include, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Debt Payoff Amount ("Estimated Closing Indebtedness"),
and Closing Company Transaction Costs ("Estimated Closing Company Transaction
Costs"), and (2)(A) wire transfer instructions for Seller and (B) an itemized
list of the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Costs broken down by Person to whom such amounts are owed and wire
instructions for each such Person or Persons to the extent reasonably
available. Purchaser will be afforded an opportunity to review and comment on
such statement, and, if requested by Purchaser, the Company will provide
Purchaser reasonable supporting documentation related thereto, and the Company
shall reasonably and in good faith consider any changes to such statement
proposed by Purchaser. For the purposes of determining the amount to be paid
by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.02(e)(ii), the
Base Purchase Price shall (i), if Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is
greater than the Target Amount, be increased by the amount of such difference,
(ii) if Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Amount,
be decreased by the amount of such difference, (iii) be increased by the
amount of Estimated Closing Cash, (iv) be decreased by the amount of Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, and (v) be decreased by the amount of Estimated Closing
Company Transaction Costs.

(c)Within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a statement (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth Purchaser's good faith calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing 

Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Costs, Purchaser Reorganization
Expense Amount and Seller Reorganization Expense Amount. Seller shall provide
Purchaser not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the expiration of such
seventy-five day period reasonable evidence of the Seller Reorganization
Expense Amount, and the Closing Statement shall be accompanied by reasonable
evidence of the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount. If Purchaser fails to
deliver the Closing Statement within ten (10) days following receipt of
written notice from Seller of the failure to timely deliver the same,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have delivered a Closing Statement as of the last
day of such ten (10) day period showing Closing Net Working Capital equal to
Estimated Net Working Capital, Closing Cash equal to Estimated Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness equal to Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Company Transaction Costs equal to Estimated Closing Company Transaction
Costs, and a Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount and Seller Reorganization
Expense Amount equal to zero ($0.00).

(d)Seller shall have a period of seventy-five (75) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement (the "Review Period") to review Purchaser's calculations of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Company Transaction Costs, the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount and the
Seller Reorganization Expense Amount set forth in the Closing Statement.
During the Review Period, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times,
Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide Seller and its representatives
with reasonable access to the books, records, facilities and management
personnel of the Company and its accountants that are reasonably related to
the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Costs, the Purchaser Reorganization
Expense Amount and the Seller Reorganization Expense Amount; provided, that
(i) such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the normal business operations of Purchaser, the Company Entities or the
Business and (ii) the Review Period shall be tolled day-for-day for each day
that Purchaser fails to provide such reasonable access requested by Seller in
writing. If Seller in good faith determines that the calculation of any of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Company Transaction Costs, the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount and/or
the Seller Reorganization Expense Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement
have not been calculated in accordance with the definitions thereof and the
other applicable provisions contained in this Agreement or contain
mathematical errors, Seller shall, prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, deliver to Purchaser a written notice (an "Objection Notice"), setting
forth the basis for such disagreement and Seller's calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company
Transaction Costs, the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount and/or the
Seller Reorganization Expense Amount, as applicable. Absent the timely
delivery of an Objection Notice, the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction
Costs, the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount and/or the Seller
Reorganization Expense Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement delivered
by Purchaser shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by,
Seller.

(e)If Seller delivers an Objection Notice in a timely manner, Purchaser and
Seller shall work together in good faith to resolve the objections set forth
therein. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all of such objections
within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Objection Notice (or such
longer period as the parties may agree in writing), then the parties shall
refer their remaining differences to BDO LLP (the "Independent Accountants")
for binding resolution. Purchaser and Seller shall each respectively submit to
the Independent Accountants in 

writing their positions on any matter set forth in the Objection Notice that
they have not been able to resolve, together with any supporting documents
which they deem relevant to the resolution of such matters. The Independent
Accountants shall act as an arbitrator to determine any disputed portions of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Company Transaction Costs, the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount and the
Seller Reorganization Expense Amount based solely on the provisions of this
Agreement and the submissions of Purchaser and Seller, and shall not conduct
an independent review of the Company's financial statements. In no event may
the Independent Accountants determine that (i) Closing Net Working Capital or
Closing Cash is less than, or that Closing Indebtedness or Closing Company
Transaction Costs are greater than, the respective amounts set forth in the
Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser (or deemed so delivered) or (ii) that
Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Cash is greater than, or that Closing
Indebtedness or Closing Company Transaction Costs are less than, the
respective amounts set forth in the Objection Notice delivered by Seller, or
(iii) that the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount or the Seller
Reorganization Expense Amount are outside the range of the respective amounts
thereof asserted by Purchaser and Seller in the Closing Statement and the
Objection Notice, respectively, in each of the foregoing cases as applicable.
Purchaser and Seller shall make readily available to the Independent
Accountants all relevant books and records and any work papers (including
those of the parties' respective accountants to the extent such accountants so
permit) relating to the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Costs, the Purchaser
Reorganization Expense Amount and/or the Seller Reorganization Expense Amount,
as applicable, and all other items reasonably requested by the Independent
Accountants. No discovery will be conducted and no arbitration hearing will be
held. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants pursuant to this
Section 2.04(e) shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, based upon the percentage which the aggregate portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the aggregate amount
actually contested by such party. (For example, if Seller claims the Closing
Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Purchaser,
and Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the
Independent Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300
of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountant will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e.,
200 ÷ 500) to Seller.)

(f)Any payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall (i) be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of the applicable calculation and (ii) be
deemed adjustments to the Base Purchase Price for all purposes. As used in
this Section 2.04, the phrase "as finally determined" means as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.04, whether by agreement of Purchaser
and Seller, failure of Seller to deliver a timely Objection Notice or by
decision of the Independent Accountants.

(i)If Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined is greater than
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then Purchaser shall pay (or cause to
be paid) to Seller the amount of such difference. If such Closing Net Working
Capital is less than Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then Seller shall
pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the amount of such difference. 

(ii)If Closing Cash as finally determined is greater than Estimated Closing
Cash, then Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller the amount of
such difference. If such Closing Cash is less than Estimated Closing Cash,
then Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the amount of such
difference.

(iii)If Closing Indebtedness as finally determined is less than Estimated
Closing Indebtedness (i.e., a smaller liability), then Purchaser shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Seller the amount of such difference. If such Closing
Indebtedness is greater than Estimated Closing Indebtedness (i.e., a larger
liability), then Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the
amount of such difference.

(iv)If Closing Company Transaction Costs as finally determined are less than
Estimated Closing Company Transaction Costs, then Purchaser shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Seller the amount of such difference. If such Closing
Company Transaction Costs are greater than Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Costs, then Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser
the amount of such difference.

(v)Seller shall pay to Purchaser one-half (50%) of the Purchaser
Reorganization Expense Amount.

(vi)Purchaser shall pay to Seller one-half (50%) of the Seller Allocated
Reorganization Amount.

(vii)Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount, if any, by which the sum of (1)
the Purchaser Reorganization Expense Amount plus (2) the amount to be paid by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.04(f)(vi) exceeds $5,000,000.

(g)Any amounts due by Seller on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, pursuant to Section 2.04(f) may be netted against each other. If any
payment is required to be made by Seller pursuant to Section 2.04(f) (any such
payment, a "Post-Closing Reduction"), Purchaser shall be entitled to retain
from the Holdback Amount an amount equal to the Post-Closing Reduction. If the
Post-Closing Reduction is greater than the Holdback Amount, then Parent shall
cause Seller to, and Seller shall, pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the
amount of such difference. Within two (2) Business Days after payment of the
amounts contemplated by Section 2.04(f), Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be
paid) any positive difference of the Holdback Amount minus the Post-Closing
Reduction, to Seller.

Section 2.05 Embedded Computing Net Asset Adjustment.

(a)At the Closing, and purely for informational purposes (no adjustment or
payments in respect thereof to then be made), Seller shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to Purchaser a good faith written estimate of the
sum of (i) the then net book value of the inventory acquired by a Company
Entity at or prior to the Closing Date and to be sold by Artesyn International
Limited ("AIL") to Artesyn Embedded Computing, Inc. (or its designee) ("AEC"),
or caused by AIL to be sold by a Company Entity to AEC, in connection with the
Contract Manufacturing Agreement (Turn-Key) after the Closing Date (including
in connection with any expiration or termination of such agreement), plus (ii)
the then net book value as of the Closing Date of the manufacturing and other
line 

equipment acquired by Company Entities at or prior to the Closing Date and to
be sold by a Company Entity to AEC in connection with such Contract
Manufacturing Agreement (Turn-Key) after the Closing Date, plus (iii) in the
event that the sale of AEC to a Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent or
Seller is consummated prior to the Closing Date, the net book value of any
accounts receivable due from AEC as of the Closing Date under the Contract
Manufacturing Agreement (Turn-Key), and minus (iv) the face value (taking into
account early-pay discounts, if any) of the accounts payable of the AIL in
respect of the inventory and equipment referenced in the immediately preceding
clauses (i) and (ii) outstanding at or prior to the Closing Date and satisfied
by AIL after the Closing Date (together, the components of such calculation
being the "EC Net Assets" and the result thereof being the "EC Net Assets
Adjustment Calculation").

(b)No later than forty five (45) days following the expiration or termination
of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement (Turn-Key), Purchaser shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a statement (the "Settlement
Statement"), setting forth Purchaser's good faith, true and correct
calculation, in reasonable detail and accompanied by supporting documentation,
of the EC Net Assets Adjustment Calculation as provided in the immediately
preceding clause (a) (i.e., utilizing values as of the Closing Date).

(c)Seller shall have a period of forty five (45) days after delivery of the
Settlement Statement to review the information therein, and during such review
period, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, Purchaser shall cause
the Company to provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access
to the books, records, facilities and management personnel of the Company and
its accountants that are reasonably related to the information therein;
provided, that (i) such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of Purchaser, the Company
Entities or the Business and (ii) such review period shall be tolled day-for-
day for each day that Purchaser fails to provide such reasonable access. If
Seller in good faith determines that the information and calculations therein
have not been calculated in accordance with the applicable provisions
contained in this Agreement or contain mathematical errors, Seller shall,
prior to the expiration of such review period, deliver to Purchaser a written
notice setting forth the basis for such disagreement. Absent the timely
delivery of such a notice of disagreement, the calculations set forth in the
Settlement Statement delivered by Purchaser shall be binding and conclusive
upon, and deemed accepted by, Seller.

(d)If Seller delivers a notice of disagreement in a timely manner, Purchaser
and Seller shall work together in good faith to resolve the objections set
forth therein. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all of such
objections within thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice of
disagreement (or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing), then
the parties shall refer their remaining differences to the Independent
Accountants for binding resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Section 2.04(e) (for such purposes, substituting the calculations in the
Settlement Statement for the subject matter of the Closing Statement).

(e)Any payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall (i) be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of the calculations in the Settlement
Statement and (ii) be deemed adjustments to the Base Purchase Price for all
purposes. As used in this Section 2.05, the phrase "as finally determined"
means as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.05, whether by
agreement of 

Purchaser and Seller, failure of Seller to deliver a timely notice of
disagreement or by decision of the Independent Accountants. If the result of
the calculations set forth in the Settlement Statement, as finally determined,
is (x) a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) to
Seller such positive amount, or (y) a negative amount, then Seller shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the absolute value of such negative amount.

as it is now being conducted, and each Company Entity (to the extent
applicable thereto) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other form
of business entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties and assets owned, operated

material. Section 4.01 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and

moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally from
time to time in effect and to general principles of equity.

Section 4.03 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation by the Company of the

Business Financial Statements and, as of the Closing, the quarterly reviewed
financial statements included in the Additional Financial Statements, were

from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
regularly prepared unaudited quarterly financial statements of the Company and

material respects the consolidated financial position and results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates

year 2018 audited financial statements included in the Additional Financial

and the regularly prepared unaudited quarterly financial statements of the

material respects the consolidated financial position and results of
operations of the Company Entities as at the respective dates thereof and for
the periods presented therein. No Company Entity is, or has in the past three
(3) years been, a party to any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934).

permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures of the Company Entities in respect of the Business
are being made in accordance with appropriate authorizations and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of assets of the Company Entities in respect of the Business.

arm's length transactions in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) all of
the accounts receivable of the Company Entities in respect of the Business are
valid and enforceable claims arising from bona fide arm's length transactions
in the ordinary course of business, and are not subject to any pending, or, to

counterclaim. None of the Company Entities have canceled, or agreed to cancel,
in whole or in part, any accounts receivable of the Company Entities reflected
on, or created since the date of, the Business Financial Statements, except in
the ordinary course of business.

(d)Subject to the reserves or allowances reflected in the Business Financial
Statements (or booked thereafter), all inventory of the Company Entities (in

all of which have been written off or written down to net realizable value.
Such quantities of inventory of the Company Entities (whether raw materials,
intermediary goods, work-in-process, finished goods or in-transit inventory)
are sufficient for the operations of the Business in the ordinary course of
business. The Company Entities are not in possession of any inventory not
owned by the Company Entities (whether on a consignment basis or otherwise),
including goods already sold.

(e)Within the previous twelve (12) months, the Company Entities and the
Business (i) have sold products only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall take
into account seasonality, cyclicality and other market conditions), (ii) have
not engaged in any practice (such as "channel stuffing") with the intent of
increasing sales of products outside of the ordinary course of business or in
anticipation of entering into this Agreement or any similar transactions and

through the date of this Agreement, and except as contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) the Company Entities have operated the Business in the ordinary
course, consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not been any Material
Adverse Effect and (iii) none of the Company Entities have taken any action
that, if taken after the date of this Agreement without Purchaser's consent,
would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 6.01.

Section 4.09 Litigation. Section 4.09(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list of (a) the Proceedings (i) that are currently, or at any time within
the previous three (3) years were, pending, and (ii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, that are currently threatened, in each case against the Company
Entities or affecting any of the Company Entities properties or assets (or to
the Knowledge of the Company against or affecting any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company Entities with respect to the Company
Entities' business) before any Governmental Entity and (b) any Proceedings by
a Company Entity currently, or at any time within the previous three (3) years
were, pending against a third party before any Governmental Entity. The
Company Entities and their properties are not subject to any Orders to which
they are a party, with respect to which they have received service of process,
or otherwise to the Knowledge of the Company. 

Section 4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a)Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and
complete list of all material Employee Plans. With respect to each such
Employee Plan, the Company has delivered or made available to Purchaser true
and complete copies of all of the following, as applicable (i) the current
plan document and any amendments thereto, (ii) the current trusts or other
funding instruments and any amendments thereto, (iii) the current summary plan
description and summaries of material modifications thereto, (iv) the two most
recent Forms 5500, including all schedules and financial statements attached
thereto, (v) with respect to any Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) or 501(a) of the Code, the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letter or, in the case of a preapproved plan, the most recent
opinion or advisory letter with respect to the underlying preapproved plan, as
well as nondiscrimination tests required under the Code for the three (3) most
recent plan years, (vi) all material correspondence, if any, in the past three
(3) years, to or from any Governmental Entity relating to such Employee Plan,
and (vii) for any such Employee Plan not in writing, a written description of
the material terms of such plan. Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
separately identifies Employee Plans that are Foreign Employee Plans (as
defined below).

(b)Other than the Employee Plans identified on Section 4.10(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules, no Company Entity has or would reasonably be expected to
have any Liability under any benefit plan maintained, sponsored, contributed
to or required to be contributed to by an ERISA Affiliate of a Company Entity.
No Company Entity, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents has, with respect to any Employee
Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-exempt "prohibited transaction",
as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA,
in the most recent three (3) years which would result in the imposition on any
Company Entity of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a material Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code.

(c)The Company does not have any material Liability imposed on it by any
Governmental Entity under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of
ERISA that remains outstanding. No Employee Plan is a self-funded group health
plan.

(d)All Employee Plans have been funded, administered and maintained, in form
and operation, in compliance with their terms and applicable Law, including,
where applicable, ERISA and the Code, in all material respects. Each Employee
Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter, or the underlying preapproved plan has
received a favorable opinion or advisory letter, from the Internal Revenue
Service and the adopting employer may rely on such favorable opinion or
advisory letter in the manner described in Section 7 of IRS Rev. Proc.
2017-41, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no events, conditions or
circumstances have occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation of such qualified status by the Internal Revenue Service. All
contributions or payments required to be made or accrued before the Closing
Date under the terms of any Employee Plan or Law applicable to such Employee
Plan will have been made or accrued by the Closing Date in all material
respects. In addition, with respect to any Employee Plan intended to include
an arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, the Company and each ERISA
Affiliate have at all times within the past three (3) years made timely
deposits of salary reduction contributions and participant loan repayments, as
determined pursuant to regulations issued by the United States 

Department of Labor or, have properly corrected any such failures in
accordance with the correction programs established by the United States
Department of Labor for late contributions.

(e)Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, since January 1,
2014, maintained, established, sponsored, or participated in, or has any
Liability with respect to or any obligation to contribute to, any (i) plan
subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii)
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA and subject
to ERISA, (iii) "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c)
of the Code, or (iv) "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA and subject to ERISA. None of the Company Entities has
any current obligation to make any non-elective employer contribution to any
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(f)No Company Entity has any current obligation to provide post-employment
health, life or other welfare benefits other than as required under COBRA or
other applicable Law. There do not exist any material pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than routine claims for
benefits), suits, actions, disputes, audits or investigations with respect to
any Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan that is a group health plan has been
designed and operated in a way that will not result in the occurrence of any
penalty or excise tax under Section 4980H of the Code, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, there is nothing that has created or would create a reporting
obligation under Section 4980D of the Code.

(g)Other than with respect to the payments included in the Company Transaction
Costs, or as a result of the Corporate Reorganization, neither the execution
nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any
other event (whether contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment or
benefit (including severance, change of control payment, golden parachute,
bonus, or otherwise) becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any current or former employee, director, independent contractor or
consultant, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any current or former
employee, director, independent contractor or consultant or (iii) accelerate
the time of the payment, funding or vesting of, or increase the amount of such
benefit or compensation.

(h)No equity securities of the Company, Seller, or Parent are readily tradable
on an established securities market or otherwise (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) such that the Company is ineligible to seek
shareholder approval in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5) of the
Code.

(i)Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 6.05, each Employee Plan
may be terminated after the Closing Date subject to the terms of such Employee
Plan and applicable Law.

(j)Each agreement, contract, plan, or other arrangement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code
to which any of the Company Entities is a party (each, a "409A Plan")
currently complies with and has been in the past three (3) years maintained in
accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any U.S.
Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service guidance issued thereunder
in all material respects. None of the Company Entities has any obligation to
reimburse or otherwise "gross-up" any Person for the 

interest, penalties, or additional Taxes that may be imposed on such Person
under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(k)Each Employee Plan that is subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction other than
the United States (whether or not United States Law also applies) (a "Foreign
Employee Plan") has been registered to the extent required and has been
maintained in good standing in all material respects with applicable Law and
regulatory authorities, and no Foreign Employee Plan is a "defined benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA).

Section 4.11 Employees and Labor Relations.

(a)Each Company Entity is in compliance, and has in the past three (3) years
been in compliance, in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating
to employment of labor and employment practices, including terms and
conditions of employment, wages, hours, occupational safety and health, equal
opportunity, fair labor standards, nondiscrimination, workers compensation,
accessibility for those with disabilities, immigration and collective
bargaining. No Company Entity is a party to or bound by any collective
bargaining, tariff, works or similar agreement with any union, works council
or other labor organization or is engaged in any labor negotiations with any
labor union or works council. No union organizing activities are pending, or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, and no such activities have
occurred within the past three (3) years. There is no labor slowdown,
stoppage, strike, lockout, or other material labor dispute pending, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting any Company Entity,
and no such material dispute has occurred within the past three (3) years.
Within the three (3) months prior to the Closing Date, no Company Entity has
implemented any plant closing or employee layoffs that required any advance
notice under the WARN Act or any similar state, local or foreign Law or
regulation affecting any site of employment of the Company Entities.

(b)Seller has made available to Purchaser a complete and accurate list of all
employees of the Company Entities, broken down by Company Entity, including
(A) each such employee's position or title, annualized base salary or hourly
wage (as applicable), annual commission opportunity or bonus potential, date
of hire, business location, accrued, unused vacation, whether such employee is
on a leave of absence, sick and/or paid time off, and part-time or full-time
status, and (B) whether each such United States employee is classified as
exempt or non-exempt for wage and hour purposes.

(c)Seller has made available to Purchaser a complete and accurate list of all
independent contractors and consultants to whom the Company is paying more
than $50,000 per annum on an annualized basis ("Contingent Workers"), showing
for each the nature of services provided, initial date of engagement, and
business location. All leased or temporary workers are engaged on a temporary

Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates has received any written
notice, or any oral notice that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
written notice, from any Material Customer, and to the Company's Knowledge no
Material Customer has otherwise notified any such Person, that such Material
Customer has or intends or otherwise expects to stop, materially decrease the
volume of, or materially change, adjust, alter or otherwise modify any of the
terms (whether related to payment, price or otherwise) with respect to,
purchasing materials, products or services from the Business or the Company
Entities (whether as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise). There is no dispute pending, or to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened in writing, with any of the Material
Customers that would reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability.
Section 4.20(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete
listing of the in-development custom product design wins of the Company

and/or a purchase order for samples, tooling or testing.

(b)Section 4.20(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of (i) the top 10 licensors, vendors, suppliers, service providers and
other similar business relations of the Business (based on the amounts paid to
such Persons by the Business) for the twelve (12) months ended December 31,
2018 (the "Material Suppliers") and (ii) the amounts paid to each such Person
during such period. None of the Company Entities, Seller, Parent, any Retained
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates has received any written
notice, or any oral notice that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
written notice, from any Material Supplier, and to the Company's Knowledge no
Material Supplier has otherwise notified any such Person, that such Material
Supplier has or intends or otherwise expects to stop, materially decrease the
volume of, or materially change, adjust, alter or otherwise modify any of the
terms (whether related to payment, price or otherwise) with respect to,
supplying materials, products or services to the Business or the Company
Entities (whether as a result of the consummation of the transactions

Suppliers that would reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability.

Section 4.21 Brokers. No Company Entity is a party to any Contract that would
require Purchaser or a Company Entity to pay any brokerage, finder's or other
fee or commission to any broker, finder or investment banker in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or that contains any
"tail" provision that would require a payment in connection with any future
acquisition or sale by a Company Entity) other than any such fee or commission
that will be paid by a Company Entity prior to the Closing.

Section 4.22 Product Warranties and Recalls. Section 4.22 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all product recalls and other
replacement, field fix, retrofit and modification campaigns made by or on
behalf of a Company Entity in the past three (3) years. No Company Entity has
received notice of any unresolved claim of personal injury, death, or property
or economic damages, or any unresolved claim for injunctive relief in
connection with any product manufactured or sold by, or any service provided
by, such Company Entity other than claims made under or pursuant to standard
contractual product or service warranties of the Company Entities made
available to Purchaser. None of the products designed, manufactured or
distributed by, or any service provided by, the Company Entities suffer in any
material respect from any material defects, or otherwise fail to meet and
comply with applicable customer standards or specifications, in each case in
such a manner as would be reasonably likely to give rise to any product
liability or warranty claims against a Company Entity in excess of the
reserves for warranty claims included in the Business Financial Statements.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
state and federal regulatory obligations with regard to disclosure of product
safety defects. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended
to any of its customers any material written product warranties,
indemnifications or warranties outside of the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. There are no material claims pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Company Entity with respect
to any warranty that covers products designed, manufactured, packaged,
marketed, labeled, shipped, sold or distributed, or services provided, by or
on behalf of the Company Entities. 

Section 4.23 Personal Property. Each of the Company Entities has good and
valid title to, or holds pursuant to valid leases or licenses, all of the
assets, rights and properties owned, licensed or leased by it and used by it
in the conduct of the Business that are individually or in the aggregate, with
a net book value of $50,000 or more or are otherwise material to the operation
of the Business by any of the Company Entities, free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens. Each of the Company Entities' equipment and other
tangible assets are in good operating condition and repair (normal wear and
tear excepted), have been maintained and repaired in the ordinary course of
business consistent with the standards generally followed in the industry in
which the Business operates, and are suitable for their intended use, in each
case in all material respects. The Company Entities have good and valid title
to, or hold pursuant to valid leases or licenses, all of the personal property
necessary for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted, in each
case, in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the services to
be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreements.

Section 4.24 Corporate Reorganization. Each of the implementing documents in
respect of the Corporation Reorganization (i) is, or when entered will be, a
valid and binding agreement of the parties thereto, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general
principles of equity, (ii) has not been amended or modified from the copy
thereof made available to Purchaser prior to the Closing, and (iii) is not the
subject of any Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by any Governmental Entity that seek the revocation, cancellation,
suspension or adverse modification thereof. None of the parties to any of the
Reorganization Documents are in default of, or have received any written
notice of any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default of, such Reorganization Documents. Following the
Corporate Reorganization, subject to the provisions of ARTICLE IX, the Company
Entities will retain only those Liabilities related to the Business.

Section 4.25 Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties

. Seller makes no representations or warranties of any kind or nature
whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied relating to the Company
Entities (including, but not limited to, any relating to financial condition,
results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Company Entities), except
as expressly set forth in this ARTICLE IV, and Seller hereby expressly
disclaims any such other representations or warranties. NOTHING IN THIS
Section 4.25 SHALL LIMIT CLAIMS OR REMEDIES FOR FRAUD OR REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES MADE IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENT TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANY, ANY
SUBSIDIARY, ANY SELLER OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES IS A PARTY.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date.

Section 5.01 Organization. Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has

is now being conducted.

Section 5.02 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Purchaser has
the requisite power and authority to execute this Agreement and to consummate

of this Agreement and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by Purchaser. Purchaser has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement. Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to
general principles of equity.

Section 5.03 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Purchaser does not, and the consummation by Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) materially conflict with or
violate any Law or judgment applicable to Purchaser or by which Purchaser's
property is bound or subject or (ii) violate or conflict with the
Organizational Documents of Purchaser.

Section 5.04 Required Filings and Consents. No waiver, Order, Permit, consent,
approval or authorization of, and no declaration or filing with, or

Section 5.05 Financing. Purchaser has received, and delivered a true and
correct copy to Seller of, a fully executed debt commitment letter dated on or
prior to the date of this Agreement (including all annexes, exhibits,
schedules and other attachments thereto, the "Debt Commitment Letter") from
the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, with the commercial terms and
specific lending group redacted to the extent required by the Debt Financing
Sources, pursuant to which such Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to Purchaser the
amount of financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt
Financing"). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in
any manner since the date thereof. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to
the Debt Financing other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. The aggregate proceeds of the
Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing), taken together with cash
on hand and available borrowing capacity of Purchaser and its Parent entities
and Affiliates, will be sufficient for Purchaser to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the payments as set forth in Section
2.02 that are required to be paid by Purchaser at, or in connection with or as
a result of, the Closing, and pay any and all fees and expenses required to be
paid by Purchaser at, or in connection with or as a result of, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this 

Agreement and (ii) Purchaser has no reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to closing of the Debt
Financing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letter.
Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof. The
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Purchaser
and each other party thereto to provide the Debt Financing subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than those specifically set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, and the only conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the Debt Financing on or prior to the
Closing Date that will be included in the definitive documentation in respect
thereof shall be those specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a breach or default on the part of Purchaser or any other
party thereto under any of the Commitment Letters. Purchaser understands and
acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser's obligation to
consummate the acquisition is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise
subject to Purchaser's, or any other Person's consummation of any financing
arrangements, Purchaser's obtaining of any financing or the availability,
grant, provision or extension of any financing to Purchaser or any other
Person.

Section 5.06 Litigation. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser which would reasonably be expected
to impair or delay Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser is not subject to any Order which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to impair or
delay Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.07 RandW Insurance Policy. The copy of the RandW Insurance Policy
attached hereto as Exhibit C is a true and complete copy thereof, and has not
been amended or modified in any manner since the date thereof. Purchaser has
fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all policy fees, premiums and other
amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the RandW Insurance Policy, and will timely fully pay (or caused
to be paid) any and all policy fees, premiums and other amounts that are due
and payable after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing
Date in connection with the RandW Insurance Policy.

Section 5.08 Nature of Purchase. Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for
investment and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Purchaser understands that the Shares are characterized as
"restricted securities" under the federal securities Laws inasmuch as they are
being acquired in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under
such Laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold without
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, only in certain
limited circumstances.

Section 5.09 Brokers. Purchaser is not a party to any agreement that would
require any Seller or any Company Entity, directly or indirectly, to pay any

Section 6.02 Access to Information; Company Entity Confidential Information.

(a)From and after the date hereof and until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing, upon reasonable advance notice
to the Company and subject to the requirements of any applicable Laws
governing access to information, the Seller and the Company shall, and shall
cause the Subsidiaries to, provide Purchaser and its directors, managers,
officers, employees, independent contractors, consultants, advisors,
accountants, legal counsel and other similar representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") reasonable access during normal business hours to (i) the
key employees and records of the Company Entities and (ii) subject to prior
consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld), and accompaniment of
representatives of Seller and/or management of the Retained Subsidiaries (at
Seller's election), applicable properties, facilities, customers, vendors and
suppliers of the Company Entities, and during such period furnish promptly to
Purchaser and its Representatives such financial, operating and other
information concerning the Company Entities and their respective businesses as
Purchaser and its Representatives may reasonably request; provided, however,
that no such access or information shall be provided to the extent doing so
would in Seller's discretion be violative of any applicable Law or could
result in the waiver of any legal privilege in favor of the Company and its
Affiliates (absent reasonable accommodations such as entering into joint
defense agreements). All information obtained by Purchaser and its
Representatives from the Company Entities shall be held in strict confidence
in accordance with the terms of that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement dated
June 19, 2018 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Platinum Equity
Advisors, LLC and AEI U.S. Subsidiary, LLC. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.02 only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, contact prior to the Closing any
officer, director, employee, customer, supplier, distributor or other material
business relation of the Company or any Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent (which may be provided by electronic mail and shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Company. 

(b)Seller recognizes that all information concerning the business and affairs
of Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries that is not, as of the date
hereof, generally available to the public (the "Confidential Information"),
whether developed by them or by any other Person for or on behalf of such
Persons or any of their Affiliates, will, from and after the Closing (other
than with respect to the Purchaser and its Affiliates that are not Company
Entities, in which case Seller recognizes that such information is the
exclusive property of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates at all
times before and after the Closing), be the exclusive property of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities). Accordingly, Seller
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, disclose to any third party (other
than each other and their respective Representatives who have a business need
arising out of this Agreement to know such information) or use any
Confidential Information, and shall utilize the same degree of care (but no
less than a reasonable degree of care) as Seller would take to preserve
confidentiality for its own similar information; provided, that the foregoing
restrictions shall not (i) apply to any information (A) generally available
to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation
of this Section 6.02(b)) or (B) independently developed by Seller or its
Representatives (other than by the Company Entities prior to the Closing)
without reference to or use of Confidential Information, or (ii) prohibit any
disclosure (A) required by Law so long as, to the extent legally permissible,
Seller, as applicable, provides Purchaser with reasonable prior notice of such
disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure or (B) made
in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.03 Public Announcements. The parties acknowledge and agree that
Purchaser, and certain Affiliates of Seller, may file, or be required to file,
one or more current and/or periodic reports under the rules and regulations of
applicable national securities exchanges, and issue a press release, regarding
the transactions completed hereby following the execution of this Agreement. A
disclosing party (Purchaser or, on behalf of such Affiliates, Seller) shall
provide to the non-disclosing party, reasonably in advance of such issuance,
copies of any such reports or releases, and shall accept and implement any
reasonable comments provided by the non-disclosing party with respect thereto;
provided that, (i) with respect to any such reports (other than on Form 8‑K),
the disclosing party need only provide the portions of such reports that
disclose information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the parties hereto, and (ii) the disclosing party may make such public
disclosure as it reasonably believes is required by Law, legal process or the
rules and regulations of any applicable national securities exchange (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), in which case it will, to the extent
reasonably practicable in the circumstances, use its reasonable efforts to
consult with the non-disclosing party with respect to the timing and content
thereof. Except with respect to the foregoing sentence, Purchaser, the Company
and Seller shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the other party's prior consent, except
as may be required by Law; provided, however, that either party may make
public statements, including the publication of "tombstone" advertisements,
without the consent of the other party to the extent that (x) such public
statements contain only information included in a prior press release or other
public statements permitted in accordance with this Section 6.03, (y) such
information is otherwise in the public domain or (z) such information is
information in which the other party has no expectation of confidentiality
(with the understanding that the parties 

hereto expect the Purchase Price and other financial details to remain
confidential except as required to comply with the accounting and the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations or the rules
of any national securities exchange). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties will be allowed to disclose the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (a) to authorized representatives and
employees of Seller or its Affiliates, (b) to its and its Affiliates'
investors in summary format as part of summary information about Seller's or
any of its Affiliates financial condition, (c) to any of Seller's Affiliates,
auditors, attorneys, financing sources, potential investors or other agents or
any other Person to whom it or its Affiliates discloses such information in
the ordinary course of business and (d) following the Closing to any bona fide
prospective purchaser of the equity or assets of Seller or its Affiliates, in
each of clause (c) and (d) if, and only to the extent, that the recipient of
such confidential information is made aware of the confidential nature of such
information and the obligation to maintain the same as confidential (and
Seller shall be responsible for any breach of such obligation).

Section 6.04 Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation.

(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
in a timely manner all necessary waivers, consents (including in the case of
the Company any required Leased Real Property landlord consents and in
connection with the Corporate Reorganization) and approvals and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings, and to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement including, without limitation, (i) cooperating in responding to
inquiries from, and making presentations to, regulatory authorities and (ii)
defending against and responding to any action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, whether judicial or administrative, challenging or relating to
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall any party's cooperation require such party to make any payments to
any third parties (other than de minimis review and consent payments required
by the terms of applicable Contracts with third parties, which, except as set
forth in Section 6.04(b), shall be borne by Seller), to undertake litigation
or with respect to the Company, to amend or waive any provision of any
Contract between any Company Entity and any third party unless such amendment
or waiver is reasonably acceptable to both Seller and Purchaser.

(b)Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(a), promptly following the
execution of this Agreement and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days
of the date hereof, Seller and Purchaser will make appropriate filings under
the German Act against Restraints of Competition, as amended (the "ARC Act"),
and the Polish Act on Competition and Consumer Protection, as amended (the
"ACCP Act"), with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the ARC Act and ACCP
Act and to take all other actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain all approvals, waivers, consents and expirations or terminations of the
applicable waiting periods under any applicable antitrust Law as soon as
reasonably practicable. The parties shall in good faith cooperate in all
respects with each 

other in connection with any filing or submission under the respective ARC Act
and ACCP Act and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry related
thereto. Purchaser shall be responsible for all fees imposed on the parties
under the ARC Act and the ACCP Act.

(c)Each of Purchaser and Seller shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
of any non-routine, material written communication made to or received by
either Purchaser or its Affiliates and/or Seller or its Affiliates, as the
case may be, from any antitrust Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, subject to applicable Law, if
reasonably practicable, permit the other parties hereto to review in advance
any proposed non-routine, material written communication to any such antitrust
Governmental Entity, provided that neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be
required to provide to each other with any documents or other materials
related to a party's valuation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and make good faith efforts to incorporate the other parties'
reasonable comments, and not agree to participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion with any such antitrust Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults
with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
antitrust Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to
attend, and furnish the other parties with copies of all material
correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
Affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand and any such
antitrust Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, provided
that neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to provide to each other
with any documents or other materials related to a party's valuation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Purchaser or Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates, be obligated
to propose, or agree to accept, any undertaking or condition, to enter into
any consent decree, to make any divestiture, to accept any operational
restriction, or take any other action that would reasonably be likely to limit
the business activities of Purchaser or Seller, respectively, or any of their
respective Affiliates (including, with respect to Purchaser, the Company
Entities after the Closing).

(e)Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and controlled
Affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

Section 6.05 Employee Covenants.

(a)Purchaser shall ensure that, for all periods following the Closing, all
Employee Plans (including replacement or equivalent plans thereof) and all
other employee benefit plans made available by Purchaser and the Company
Entities and their Affiliates to individuals who were employed by a Company
Entity immediately prior to the Closing and who continue to be employed by the
Company Entities and their Affiliates immediately after the Closing (the
"Continuing Employees") (each plan, a "Post-Closing Plan") recognize all years
of service and employment with the Company Entities and any predecessor
companies of the Company Entities for the purposes of eligibility and vesting,
and for purposes of the level of benefits under any Post-Closing Plan that
provides for severance or paid time off (but not for the purposes of vesting
of future equity awards or benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan except as required by applicable Law), to the same extent such service
and employment was recognized for similar purposes under the Post-Closing Plan
or an equivalent Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date. Subject
to Purchaser obtaining consent from all applicable third-party service
providers and insurers, Purchaser shall, for all periods following the Closing
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no Post-Closing Plan limits
or restricts the benefits of any Continuing Employee based on any pre-existing
condition, exclusions or waiting periods, except to the extent such limitation
was in effect and unsatisfied under an equivalent Employee Plan immediately
prior to the Closing.

(b)For the period ending December 31, 2019, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Company Entities and their Affiliates to, maintain the Employee Plans
providing incentive compensation opportunities that are identified in Section
4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule on terms as least as favorable to the
Continuing Employees. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall pay or
cause the Company Entities and their Affiliates to pay to the Continuing
Employees the incentive compensation included in the final determination of
the Purchase Price (but in each case only to the extent payable pursuant to
the applicable plan terms on the applicable payment date).

(c)As is noted in Section 6.01 of the Disclosure Schedule, Seller may elect to
accelerate the time of payment of one or more of the Existing Sale Bonus
Agreements such that any amounts that may have been paid more than seventy
five days after the Closing Date are instead paid prior to or within seventy
five days prior to the Closing Date. If any Existing Sale Bonus Agreements
with respect to Continuing Employees will require a payment more than seventy
five days after the Closing Date, (i) Seller will provide written notice of
such fact to Purchaser in connection with the estimates delivered pursuant to
Section 2.04(b), (ii) from time to time following the Closing and through the
date that is one (1) year following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall keep
Seller promptly informed as to the termination or resignation, if any, of the
employment of each such Continuing Employee who is party to such Existing Sale
Bonus Agreement, and (iii) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, within a
reasonable period of time prior to the required date of payment in respect
thereof, a written statement identifying the payments required to be made to
such employee (each such payment, together with the aggregate amount of any
employer portion of any payroll, social security, unemployment or similar
Taxes that arise as a result of such payment, being a "Post-Closing Bonus
Payment"). Upon receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall promptly determine and
inform Seller of the amount of the employer portion of any payroll, social
security, unemployment or similar Taxes that would arise as a result of each 

such payment (time being of the essence in this respect) and Purchaser shall
promptly provide Seller with appropriate wire transfer instructions for each
such payment, and Seller shall thereupon deliver to Purchaser, in accordance
with such wire transfer instructions, promptly, and in any event at least five
(5) days before the date of payment, an amount in cash equal to aggregate
amount of the Post-Closing Bonus Payments. Upon receipt of such amounts,
Purchaser shall cause the appropriate Company Entity (or Purchaser or its
Affiliate) to pay, in the first regularly scheduled payroll following receipt
of such amounts, the payment amount specified in Seller's notice to the
applicable Continuing Employee specified in such notice, in each case less any
applicable withholding Taxes. If such employee identified in such a written
notice from Seller is no longer an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates as
of the applicable date of payment, Purchaser shall promptly return to Seller
the amount provided by Seller to Purchaser in respect of such employee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, payments made or
to be made under this Section 6.05(c), if any, will not be included in the
final determinations of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Net Working Capital or
Closing Company Transaction Costs.

(d)Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Purchaser's or its Affiliates' ability
to amend, modify or terminate any particular benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or former
employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period of
time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment, or (iv) is intended to confer upon any individual
(including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or
retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

Section 6.06 Pre-Closing Period Tax Matters.

(a)Purchaser shall pay (or cause the Company to pay) to Seller the amount of
any foreign, federal or state income Taxes paid by the Company Entities with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Seller Income Tax
Overpayments) that are refunded to Purchaser or any of the Company Entities
(or applied as a credit against the Taxes of Purchaser or any Company Entity)
after the Closing Date (but net of applicable costs and expenses, including
Taxes imposed with respect to such refunds or credits), provided that such
refund is received or credit applied prior to the expiration of the last
taxable year of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities)
that includes December 31, 2021 (such Tax refunds or credits, net of such
applicable costs and expenses, the "Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Refunds").
For this purpose, (i) a Tax refund shall be deemed to have been "received by"
or "applied as a credit against the Taxes of" Purchaser or a Company Entity to
the extent that such Tax refund is used to reduce Purchaser's or any Company
Entity's, or any other member of the consolidated tax group that includes any
such Person's, Liability for Taxes for a period commencing after the Closing
Date, (ii) in the case of a Straddle Period, the Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Refund payable to Seller with respect to such period shall be determined by
calculating the Tax for the Pre-Closing Tax Period in a manner consistent with
subsection (e) hereof and taking into account payments of such Taxes during
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and (iii)
whether, for purposes of the preceding clause (i) or clause (ii), a Tax refund
is deemed to be received or applied as a credit shall be determined by
assuming that all other losses, deductions and credits of the consolidated tax
group of which Purchaser and the Company Entities are a part for the
applicable tax period (including any NOL Carryforwards and Seller Business
Interest Expense 

Carryforward Deductions) are utilized before such Tax refund or credit is
used. Purchaser shall not, absent Seller's prior written consent, make any Tax
carryback or other tax election with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of
any Company Entity that would reduce the amount of any Pre-Closing Period
Income Tax Refund. Seller shall promptly return any Pre-Closing Period Income
Tax Refunds to Purchaser in the event Purchaser or the Company Entities are
required to repay any amount with respect thereto to any Governmental Entity.

(b)After the Closing, at its own expense, (i) the Company shall cause its
historical tax preparers in the Los Angeles office of Ernst and Young LLP to
prepare, and the Company shall file or cause to be filed (i) all income Tax
Returns of the Company Entities for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date which are to be filed after the Closing Date and for all Straddle
Periods (provided that, with respect to any such Straddle Period returns, the
Company may use such tax preparation firm other than Ernst and Young LLP as may
be determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion); and (ii) the
Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Company Entities to pay) all Taxes
shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns, in accordance with the
applicable Tax Laws.

(i)The Company shall prepare, and shall cause the aforementioned tax preparers
to prepare, such income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the prior
practices of Seller and the Company Entities to the extent consistent with
applicable Law, and otherwise as provided in this Section 6.06. The Company
shall provide such income Tax Returns to Seller for review and comment at
least 20 days prior to their filing. Purchaser and the Company shall permit
Seller to review and comment on each such income Tax Return, and shall make
such revisions to such income Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by
Seller and consistent with the prior practices of Seller and the Company
Entities (taking into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the provisions of this Agreement). In the event of a dispute among the
parties with respect to any item on any such income Tax Return, the parties
shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which
such income Tax Return is required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve
any disputed item, the item or items in question shall be resolved in a manner
similar to that set forth in Section 2.04(e); provided, however, that such
disputes shall not prevent the timely filing of any such income Tax Return.

(ii)In addition to, and not in limitation of, Seller's obligations in respect
of Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Article IX, Seller shall be responsible for
all income Taxes payable with respect to the operations of the Company
Entities for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and Purchaser shall be responsible for
all income Taxes payable with respect to the operations of the Company
Entities and the Subsidiaries after the Closing. Purchaser shall remit or
cause to be remitted all income Taxes in respect of Straddle Period Tax
Returns; provided, however, that not later than five (5) days before the due
date for payment of income Taxes with respect to any such Straddle Period
Income Tax Returns, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to that
portion of the income Taxes shown on such return for which Seller is
responsible pursuant to this Section 6.06(b).

(iii)It is the intent of the parties hereto that (x) all Seller Tax Deductions
and all Seller Business Interest Expense Carryforward Deductions shall be
applied and deducted by the Company Entities in a Pre-Closing Tax Period to
the extent permitted 

under applicable Law and (y) such deductions (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) shall be reflected in the final income Tax Returns of the
Company for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date. Concurrently with the
delivery of such income Tax Returns to Seller pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 6.06(b), Purchaser and the Company shall prepare and deliver to Seller
a calculation of the NOL Carryforwards (including any Seller Tax Deductions
included in such NOL Carryforwards) and Seller Business Interest Expense
Carryforward Deductions. Purchaser and the Company shall permit Seller to
review and comment on such calculations, and shall make such revisions thereto
as are reasonably requested by Seller taking into account the items of income,
gain, loss, and deduction reported in said income Tax Returns. In the event of
a dispute among the parties with respect to such calculations, the parties
shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which
said income Tax Returns are required to be filed. If the parties cannot
resolve any disputed item, the item or items in question shall be resolved in
a manner similar to that set forth in Section 2.04(e).

(iv)Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of the Tax Benefit (as
hereinafter defined) attributable to the amount of NOL Carryforwards and
Seller Business Interest Expense Carryforward Deductions actually utilized in
the income Tax Returns of the Purchaser or the Company Entities for Post-
Closing Tax Periods ending on or before the expiration of the last tax year of
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) that includes
December 31, 2021 (the "Carryforward Deductions"). For purposes of this clause
(iv), (A) the amount of the NOL Carryforwards utilized in a Post-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined by subtracting the Tax liability of Purchaser or
the Company Entities for such period, determined by including such NOL
Carryforward deductions, from the Tax liability of Purchaser or the Company
Entities for such period, determined without such NOL Carryforward deductions
and treating such deductions as the last item of any available net operating
loss carryforward to be used; (B) the amount of a Seller Business Interest
Expense Carryforward Deduction utilized in a Post-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined by subtracting the Tax liability of Purchaser or the Company
Entities for such period, determined by including such deductions, from the
Tax liability of Purchaser or the Company Entities determined without such
deductions and treating such deductions as the last item of any available
business interest expense to be used; and (C) the amount of the Seller Tax
Deductions included in the NOL Carryforwards shall be determined by assuming
that such deductions are utilized in the Pre-Closing Tax Period before any net
operating losses or business interest expense from prior periods. The amount
of a "Tax Benefit" derived from utilization of Carryforward Deductions shall
be deemed to be the product of (i) the amount of such deduction utilized, as
described above, multiplied by (ii) 21.00%. The amount of any such Tax Benefit
attributable to Carryforward Excess Deductions shall be treated as "realized"
on the date the Tax Return reflecting the use of such deduction is filed, and
shall be computed without taking into account any redemption or other
corporate contraction described in Section 382(e)(2) of the Code. Within five
(5) days after the filing of such Tax Return, Purchaser shall pay the amount
of such Tax Benefit to Seller.

(c)As promptly as practicable after the end of each Tax period taken into
account under this Section 6.06, and in any event no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the filing of the applicable Tax Returns for such Tax
period or the receipt of any cash Tax refund, in 

either case, that may result in a required payment to Seller under this
Section 6.06, during which, in the good faith determination of Purchaser, any
items (refunds, deductions, overpayments, etc.) remain outstanding, Purchaser
will deliver to Seller a statement in reasonable detail, together with any
applicable supporting materials, of the amounts payable to Seller, together
with any calculations applicable thereto (including "with and without"
calculations, if applicable).

(d)In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to the Straddle Period
imposed on income, sales, receipts, or payments, the portion of any such Tax
that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
applicable taxable year ended at the Determination Time. The amount of all
other Straddle Period Taxes allocable to the pre-Closing portion of such
Straddle Period shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of the Tax
for the applicable Straddle Period by a fraction whose numerator is the number
of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date and whose denominator is the total number of days in such
Straddle Period.

(e)In the event of any audit, investigation, litigation or other proceeding in
respect of any Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a
"Tax Matter"), Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing of such Tax
Matter, and Seller (and its representatives) shall have the right (i) to
represent the Company Entities in such Tax Matter if such Pre-Closing Tax
Period ends on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) to participate in such
Tax Matter and be kept reasonably informed as to any correspondence received
with respect thereto if the Tax Matters involves a Straddle Period. In any
case, the party responsible for representing the Company Entities in the Tax
Matter shall not settle any such Tax Matter without the other party's consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(f)Purchaser, the Company Entities and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.06 and any
Tax Matter. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Matter and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Purchaser, Seller and Seller further agree, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). In the event
of any audit, investigation, litigation or other proceeding in respect of any
Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a "Tax Matter"),
the party receiving notice thereof shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such Tax Matter, and Seller (and its representatives) shall have
the right (i) to represent the Company Entities in such Tax Matter if such
Pre-Closing Tax Period ends on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) to
participate in such Tax Matter and be kept reasonably informed as to any
correspondence received with respect thereto if the Tax Matters involves a
Straddle Period. In any case, the party responsible for representing the
Company Entities in the Tax Matter shall not settle any such Tax Matter
without the other party's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If, in the Tax Matter, there is a final determination
that reduces the amount of the NOL Carryforwards or Seller Business Interest
Expense Carryforward Deductions (on a net basis between the two), then, within
five (5) days after 

such final determination, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the sum of (A) the
amount, if any, by which the aggregate payments that would have been due from
Seller to Purchaser under Section 6.06(b)(iv) if the calculation of the NOL
Carryforwards and the Seller Business Interest Expense Carryforward Deductions
under Section 6.06(b)(iii) had taken into account the final determination
resulting from the Tax Matter exceeds the amount of the payment actually made
pursuant to Section 6.06(b)(iv). If, in the Tax Matter, there is a final
determination that increases the amount of NOL Carryforwards or Seller
Business Interest Expense Carryforward Deductions (on a net basis between the
two), then, within five (5) days after such final determination, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller the sum of (A) the amount, if any, by which the payment
that would have been due from Seller to Purchaser under Section 6.06(b)(iv) if
the calculation of the NOL Carryforwards and the Seller Business Interest
Expense Carryforward Deductions under Section 6.06(b)(iii) had taken into
account the final determination resulting from the Tax Matter is less than the
amount of the payment actually made pursuant to Section 6.06(b)(iv).

(g)All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving any of the Company Entities (excluding for these purposes,
commercial agreements not having a principal purpose relating to Tax that were
entered into in the ordinary course of business and contain customary Tax
indemnification provisions) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and,
after the Closing Date, none of the Company Entities shall be bound thereby or
have any Liability thereunder.

(h)Any and all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other Taxes and fees payable (and costs and expenses related thereto) in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than Taxes described in Section 2.01, which are the
responsibility of Seller) shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller,
and Purchaser, the Company Entities, and Seller shall cooperate to file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees, including as required, joining in the execution of any such Tax Returns
and documentation and using commercially reasonable efforts to legally reduce
the imposition of any such amounts.

Section 6.07 Indemnification of Directors and Officers. For six (6) years
after the Closing Date, the Company shall not and shall cause each Company
Entity not to amend, or otherwise modify (unless such modification is required
by Law) in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the applicable
indemnitees, the indemnification provisions currently provided by the
Organizational Documents of each Company Entity, for the benefit of the
directors and officers of the Company Entities prior to the Closing. If any
Company Entity consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then and in each such case, Purchaser shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such Company
Entity assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07. Seller will at
or prior to the Closing purchase or cause to be purchased customary "tail"
director and officer and fiduciary (as applicable) insurance covering the then
current and former directors and officers and fiduciaries (as applicable) of
the Company Entities against claims for a period of six years after the
Closing on terms and conditions not less favorable to such directors and
officers and fiduciaries (as applicable) as existing in the Company's director
and officer and fiduciary (as applicable) liability insurance policies as of
the date of this 

Agreement. This Section 6.07 is intended to be for the benefit of, and to
grant third-party beneficiary rights to, the Persons who served as directors
and officers and fiduciaries (as applicable) of the Company Entities prior to
the Closing. Each such Person shall be entitled to enforce this Section 6.07
to the same extent as if such Person were a party hereto and a direct
beneficiary of this Section 6.07, and no such person shall be obligated to
seek contribution from any other Person who may have an obligation to
indemnify such person for any matter with respect to which such covered person
is entitled to indemnification from any Company Entity by virtue of this this
Section 6.07.

Section 6.08 Preservation of Records.

(a)For a period of seven (7) years from the date of creation of such books and
records, or such other longer period as required by applicable Law, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall preserve and retain their corporate,
accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and other books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including (i) any documents relating to any
governmental or non-governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations and (ii) all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and other
material records or other documents relating to Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. At the end of such
seven-year period, the Company and its Subsidiaries may dispose of any such
books and records which are first offered to, but not accepted (within five
(5) Business Days of such offer) by Seller, subject in all respects to
Seller's confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 6.02(b).

(b)In the event and for so long as Seller or its Affiliates (other than a
Company Entity) is actively contesting or defending against any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in
connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries, each of the other parties shall cooperate with it and its
counsel in the defense or contest, make available their personnel, and provide
such testimony and access to their books and records as shall be necessary or
reasonably requested in connection with the defense or contest, all at the
sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party.

Section 6.09 Financing.

(a)Purchaser shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, as promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy,
or cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis all conditions to Purchaser
obtaining the Debt Financing set forth therein that are within its control,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on
other terms that are reasonably acceptable to the Debt Financing Sources, and
(iii) subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE
VII (except for those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at or
prior to Closing. 

(b)Purchaser shall give the Seller prompt written notice (A) if and when
Purchaser becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter will not be available for financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) of any expiration or
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) of any actual or reasonably
anticipated material breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (D) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any actual or potential material
breach, default, termination, or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or other related document. If any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on
commercially reasonable terms in an amount sufficient to replace any
unavailable portion of the Debt Financing ("Alternative Financing") as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and the
provisions of this Section 6.09(b) shall be applicable to the Alternative
Financing, and, for the purposes of this Section 6.09(b), all references to
the Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing and
all references to the Debt Commitment Letter or other documents related
thereto shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative Financing;
provided, however, that any such efforts and any such Alternative Financing,
or the negotiation or implementation thereof, shall not be a condition to, or
justify or excuse any delay in, the performance by Purchaser of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement,
in no event shall reasonable best efforts be deemed or construed to require
Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall not be required to, (A) pay any fees in
excess of those contemplated by the commitments under the Debt Commitment
Letter, (B) agree to economic terms of the Debt Financing that are materially
less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser than those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, or (C) initiate, prosecute or maintain any lawsuit,
arbitration or similar proceeding against any lenders, Debt Financing Source
or other Persons providing the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letters. Purchaser shall not permit, without the prior written consent of
Seller, any amendment or modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter
that (individually or in the aggregate with any other amendments,
modifications, or waivers) would reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount less than $250,000,000, or
that would otherwise be less than the amount necessary to fund the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including all fees, costs and
expenses to be incurred in connection therewith), or (y) impose any new or
additional condition to the receipt of any portion of the Debt Financing;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be
permitted to amend, restate, replace, supplement and/or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter to (i) correct typographical errors or (ii) add lenders,
agents, co-agents, arrangers, bookrunners, managers or other roles under the
Debt Commitment Letter or reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles
or roles to, or between or among, any entities party thereto (including
replacement of a lender).

(c)From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VIII hereof,
Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser and Purchaser's Affiliates in connection with the Debt Financing,
including: (i) furnishing Purchaser with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Debt Financing as may reasonably be requested in writing by Purchaser,
including at least three (3) Business Days prior 

to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information about the Company
and its Subsidiaries that shall have been reasonably requested by the
Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date and that the
Purchaser reasonably determines is required by United States regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; (ii) assisting with the
preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, confidential information memorandum or similar marketing materials
in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) participation by officers and
senior management employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all as may
reasonably be requested by Purchaser, in a reasonable number of presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, (iv)
assisting with the preparation of disclosure schedules to any pledge and
security documents or other definitive financing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser; provided that no obligation of the Company
or its Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement shall be effective
until the Closing; (v) facilitating the pledging of collateral reasonably
requested by Purchaser; provided that no pledge shall be effective until the
Closing; and (vi) taking such other actions as are reasonably requested by
Purchaser to satisfy the requirements of the Debt Financing as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter; provided, however, that (x) neither the Company
nor any of its officers or directors shall be required to sign any
representation letters or other certifications for Purchaser's accountants,
(y) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or ongoing operations of the Seller, Parent or the Company Entities
and (z) no obligation of the Company Entities under any certificate, document
or instrument shall be effective until the consummation of the Closing and the
Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other Liability in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior to the consummation of the
Closing. Purchaser shall, (x) upon the written request by Seller, promptly
reimburse the Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Seller, Parent or the Company Entities in connection with such
financing cooperation pursuant to this Section 6.09(b) (other than any amounts
that would have been incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement regardless of the Debt Financing) and (y) indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, the Company Entities and their respective Affiliates and
representatives (including, following the consummation of the Closing, their
respective officers and directors as of the consummation of the Closing) from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except to the
extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses result from information
provided by Seller, Parent the Company Entities, or their respective
Affiliates or gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Seller,
Parent, the Company Entities, or their respective Affiliates or
representatives. The information provided pursuant to this Section 6.09(b)
will be used solely for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and will be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Subject to Purchaser's indemnification obligations under this
Section 6.09(b), Seller, Parent, and the Company Entities hereby consent to
the use of all of the Company's corporate logos in connection with the
syndication or marketing of the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage Seller, Parent, and the Company Entities and/or the reputation or
goodwill of Seller, Parent, and the Company Entities. 

Section 6.10 Parachute Payment Waivers; 280G Approvals.

(a)Seller shall, or shall cause an applicable Company Entity to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the initiation of the
requisite stockholder approval procedure under Section 6.10(b), a written
waiver from each Person who has a right to receive a Section 280G Payment (as
defined below), in each case of that portion of the Section 280G Payments that
exceeds 2.99 times such Person's "base amount" determined in accordance with
Section 280G of the Code (such amounts, to the extent waived by each such
Person, the "Waived Amounts"); provided, however, that Purchaser reasonably
cooperates with Parent, Seller, and/or the Company Entities, as the case may
be, as needed and reasonably requested, in the completion of the foregoing
mathematical analysis, including by providing relevant compensation or other
benefit information required to complete such analysis. Prior to soliciting
any such waiver, a copy of the form waiver any mathematical analysis of the
Section 280G Payments shall be provided to Purchaser for its review and
reasonable approval (which review shall be conducted in a timely manner).
Seller shall expend commercially reasonable efforts to provide such waiver and
analysis to Purchaser for review at least three (3) days in advance of such
solicitation.

(b)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit to its stockholders for
approval any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code ("Section
280G Payments") to the extent of the Waived Amounts in the manner provided
under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, such that no such payments and
benefits shall be deemed to be Section 280G Payments. Prior to soliciting any
such stockholder approval, a copy of the stockholder disclosure documents and
form of stockholder consent and any other material documentation related to
such stockholder approval process shall be provided to Purchaser for its
review and reasonable approval (which review shall be conducted in a timely
manner). Seller shall expend commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
stockholder documents to Purchaser for review at least three (3) days in
advance of such solicitation. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Purchaser written notification and documentation that a vote of the
stockholders of the Company was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of
the Code and that either the requisite stockholder approval was obtained, or
the requisite stockholder approval was not obtained and as a consequence the
Waived Amounts shall not be paid or provided.

Section 6.11 Notice of Material Developments.

(a)Each of Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall, prior to the Closing, give prompt written notice to the other if
any of Parent, Seller or Purchaser becomes aware of (i) any inaccuracy of or
variance in any of its representations or warranties contained in Article III
or Article IV, as the case may be, that results in or would reasonably be
expected to result in Losses (including for clarity, any reduction in the
enterprise value of the Business, calculated as a multiple of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of the Business) to
be indemnified by Parent and Seller in favor of the Purchaser Parties under
Section 9.02(a) that would be in excess of $20,000,000, (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement hereunder by such party and (iii) any other material
development affecting the ability of such party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Delivery of any such notice by any party
hereto shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder. 

(b)Without limiting Section 6.11(a), if any party delivers written notice of a
material development to the other parties pursuant to Section 6.11(a) that
results in or would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the
representations and warranties of Seller and Parent set forth in this
Agreement that are not Specified Representations and Warranties, or set forth
in clause (ii) of Section 4.08, to be true and correct on and as of the
Closing Date (other than those representations and warranties that address
matters only as of a particular date), in each case where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would, individually
or in the aggregate, result in or reasonably be expected to result in Losses
(including for clarity, any reduction in the enterprise value of the Business,
calculated as a multiple of EBITDA of the Business) to be indemnified by
Parent and Seller in favor of the Purchaser Parties under Section 9.02(a) that
would be in excess of $20,000,000, then:

(i)if the written notice delivered pursuant to Section 6.11(a) is (A)
delivered by Parent or Seller, it shall be accompanied by, or (B) delivered by
Purchaser, then, within ten (10) days following such delivery, Parent and/or
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, a statement of the amount of such
reasonably expected indemnifiable Losses as reasonably and in good faith
determined by Parent and/or Seller, and an explanation in reasonable detail of
the facts regarding the matters set forth in such notice and of the
methodology and supporting facts in respect of the calculation of the amount
of such indemnifiable Losses, together with any material written documentation
in respect thereof (such a notice, a "Triggering Interim Breach Notice", and
the material development in respect thereof, an "Interim Breach").

(ii)Purchaser shall have until 5:00 pm pacific time on the date that is ten
(10) days following receipt of such Triggering Interim Breach Notice (the
"Interim Breach Review Period") to consider, and to consult with Seller
regarding, such Triggering Interim Breach Notice and the information therein.

(iii)If Purchaser reasonably and in good faith believes that the amount of
such reasonably expected indemnifiable Losses (including for clarity, any
reduction in the enterprise value of the Business, calculated as a multiple of
EBITDA of the Business) in respect of the Interim Breach(es) set forth in such
Triggering Interim Breach Notice would be in excess of $35,000,000 (such that
the condition precedent to the Closing set forth in clause (ii) of Section
7.02(a) would not be satisfied as a result thereof), then:

(1)Purchaser shall notify Seller prior to the end of the Interim Breach Review
Period as to whether Purchaser elects to (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(f), or (y) proceed to consummate the Closing and seek any
available indemnification in respect of such breaches of representations and
warranties from Parent and Seller pursuant to this Agreement. An election to
proceed to consummate the Closing shall be accompanied by Purchaser's good
faith and reasonable determination of the amount of the applicable
indemnifiable Losses (including for clarity, any reduction in the enterprise
value of the Business, calculated as a multiple of EBITDA of the Business)
relevant to the applicable Triggering Interim Breach Notice (as used in this
clause (iii), "Purchaser's Claimed Losses"). If Purchaser does not timely
deliver such notice, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to terminate
this 

Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f). A timely election by Purchaser to
proceed to consummate the Closing shall constitute a waiver of the condition
precedent to the Closing set forth in clause (ii) of Section 7.02(a) with
respect to the Interim Breach(es) set forth in such Triggering Interim Breach
Notice.

(2)If Purchaser timely elects to proceed to consummate the Closing, then
Seller shall have until 5:00 pm pacific time on the date that is five (5) days
following the end of the Interim Breach Review Period (the period of time from
Purchaser's receipt of a Triggering Interim Breach Notice until the expiration
of such five (5) day period being the "Interim Breach Standstill Period") to
notify Purchaser as to whether Seller elects to terminate this Agreement, or
proceed with the Closing.

(3)If Purchaser timely delivers notice of its intent, or is deemed to have
elected, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) in respect of
the Interim Breach(es) set forth in such Triggering Interim Breach Notice,
then such notice shall be effective to terminate this Agreement as provided in
ARTICLE VIII at 5:00 pm pacific time on the last day of the Interim Breach
Review Period.

(4)If Purchaser elects to proceed to consummate the Closing pursuant to
Section 6.11(b)(iii)(1)(y), then, unless Seller timely delivers notice of its
election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f), the Escrow
Amount to be funded at Closing shall be increased by an amount that is agreed
between the parties reasonably and in good faith in respect of the Interim
Breach(es) set forth in the applicable Triggering Interim Breach Notice;
provided, that if the parties are unable to so agree prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, such additional amount shall be equal to the amount by which
Purchaser's Claimed Losses are in excess of $20,000,000 (but such additional
amount shall not exceed $30,000,000).

(iv)If Purchaser reasonably and in good faith believes that the amount of such
reasonably expected indemnifiable Losses (including for clarity, any reduction
in the enterprise value of the Business, calculated as a multiple of EBITDA of
the Business) in respect of the Interim Breach(es) set forth in such
Triggering Interim Breach Notice would be in excess of $20,000,000, and less
than or equal to $35,000,000, then:

(1)Purchaser shall notify Seller prior to the end of the Interim Breach Review
Period as to Purchaser's good faith and reasonable determination of the amount
of the applicable indemnifiable Losses (including for clarity, any reduction
in the enterprise value of the Business, calculated as a multiple of EBITDA of
the Business) relevant to the applicable Triggering Interim Breach Notice (as
used in this clause (iv), "Purchaser's Claimed Losses"). If Purchaser does not
timely deliver such notice, Purchaser's Claimed Losses in respect of such
Triggering Interim Breach Notice shall be deemed to be the amount of such
indemnifiable Losses set forth in the applicable Triggering Interim Breach
Notice.

(2)An additional amount shall be added to the Escrow Amount that is agreed to
between the parties reasonably and in good faith in respect of the 

Interim Breach(es) with respect to which indemnifiable Losses are in excess of
$20,000,000, as set forth in the applicable Triggering Interim Breach Notice;
provided, that if the parties are unable to so agree prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, such additional amount shall be equal to the amount by which
Purchaser's Claimed Losses are in excess of $20,000,000.

(c)When determining under this Section 6.11 whether Losses to be indemnified
by Parent and Seller in favor of the Purchaser Parties under Section 9.02(a)
are of, or are in excess of, a particular indicated amount, clauses (d) and
(e) of Section 9.04 and any available recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy
shall be disregarded. The amount of "Purchaser's Claimed Losses" shall not be
binding on Purchaser in respect of any Claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement.

Section 6.12 Certain Reorganization Matters.

(a)Purchaser shall expend its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
filings under German foreign investment control rules with the German Federal
Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy or other applicable Governmental
Entity in Germany immediately following the date of this Agreement. Purchaser
shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the status of such filing, its
submission, and any communications regarding the same or the expiration of any
applicable waiting periods in respect of the same. If Purchaser notifies
Seller in writing on the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the then
expected Closing Date that the applicable transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have not yet received clearance without restrictions (including the
expiry of applicable waiting periods) from the German Federal Ministry for
Economic Affairs and Energy under German foreign investment control rules as
of such notice date, Seller shall (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in
writing) divest, contribute or distribute Artesyn Embedded Technologies GmbH
to Seller or its Affiliate (other than a Company Entity) at or prior to the
Closing as part of the Corporate Reorganization.

(b)In respect of the Retained Business conducted by AEC, upon the occurrence
of the "Effective Date" (as such term is defined in the applicable Contract
Manufacturing Agreement and Transition Service Agreement), Seller shall cause
the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries to satisfy, cancel or otherwise
eliminate any intercompany accounts between the Company Entities, on the one
hand, and the entities comprising the Retained Business conducted by AEC, on
the other hand. In respect of the Retained Business conducted by Consumer HK
Holdco II Limited, upon the occurrence of the "Effective Date" (as such term
is defined in the applicable Contract Manufacturing Agreement and Transition
Service Agreement), Seller shall cause the Company and its applicable
Subsidiaries to satisfy, cancel or otherwise eliminate any intercompany
accounts between the Company Entities, on the one hand, and the entities
comprising the Retained Business conducted by Consumer HK Holdco II Limited,
on the other hand.

Section 6.13 Additional Financials. Prior to the Closing, as soon as
practicable after they become available, Seller shall (at its sole cost)
deliver to Purchaser complete and correct copies of (a) the consolidated
balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income,
statements of stockholder's equity and statements of cash flows of the Company
Entities, solely in respect of the Business for the twelve-month period ended
December 

31, 2018, audited by Ernst and Young LLP and (b) the consolidated balance
sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income,
statements of stockholder's equity and statements of cash flows of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for each quarter ended at least 60 days prior to the
Closing, reviewed by Ernst and Young LLP (together, the "Additional Financial
Statements"). The quarterly Additional Financial Statements described in the
immediately preceding clause (b) shall be accompanied by a separate statement
of unaudited pro forma adjustments thereto for business segments of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that do not comprise a part of the Business.
Further, Seller shall (at its sole cost) prior to the Closing provide to
Purchaser, as soon as practicable after they become available, the unaudited
internal management financial statements of the Company Entities solely in
respect of the Business as of and for each month that occurs at least thirty
(30) days prior to the Closing Date, in each case prepared consistent with
past practices.

Section 6.14 No Negotiations. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing Date, Seller and Parent will, and will cause each of their
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, (a) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussion or negotiation with
any Persons (other than the Purchaser) conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any proposed, potential or contemplated acquisition of the Shares
or the assets of the Business (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary
course of business), any merger, consolidation, combination, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving any of the Company
Entities or any other issuance of capital stock or equity interests of any
such entity or sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant
portion of any such entity's properties or assets or similar transaction
involving the Business (an "Acquisition Transaction"); and (b) refrain, from
taking (and will not take or omit to take), directly or indirectly, any action
(or omit to take any action) (i) to encourage, solicit or initiate the
submission of any proposal or indication of interest relating to an
Acquisition Transaction with any Person (other than the Purchaser); (ii) to
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Transaction with any Person (other than Purchaser);
(iii) to authorize, engage in, or enter into any Contract, agreement or
understanding (other than with Purchaser) with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction (or any proposal or indication of interest relating thereto) or
(iv) sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or dispose of any
of the equity interests of any of the Company Entities, in each case other
than in respect of the Corporate Reorganization transactions. In addition,
Parent and Seller shall promptly advise Purchaser in writing (which may be
effected by email) of the receipt of any written offer from a third party that
would be likely, in the reasonable estimation of Parent and Seller, to lead to
an Acquisition Transaction having terms and conditions, in the aggregate, more
favorable to Parent and Seller than the aggregate terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

Section 6.15 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a)As an inducement to Purchaser to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to preserve the goodwill
associated with the Business, for a period of three (3) years from and after
the Closing Date, each of Seller and Parent shall not, and each of Seller and
Parent shall cause its respective Subsidiaries (other than the Company
Entities), including the Retained Subsidiaries (in each case, for so long as
such respective Subsidiaries continue to be Subsidiaries of Seller or Parent),
not to, directly or 

indirectly, engage in, continue in or carry on any business that competes in
any material respect with the Business; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prohibit (x) the ownership of the Retained Subsidiaries, and the
operation of their respective businesses as currently conducted and proposed
to be conducted, or the ownership and operation of the Retained Business; or
(y) the ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the securities of any
corporation or other entity that is listed on a national securities exchange
or traded in the national over-the-counter market. The geographic scope of
this covenant not to compete shall extend worldwide. Recognizing the
specialized nature of the Business, Parent and Seller acknowledge and agree
that the duration, geographic scope and activity restrictions of this covenant
not to compete are reasonable.

(b)During the period of twenty-four (24) months from and after the Closing
Date, each of Seller and Parent shall not, and each of Seller and Parent shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries (other than the Company Entities), including
the Retained Subsidiaries (subject to the last sentence of this Section
6.15(b) below), not to, directly or indirectly, including through any other
Person, solicit, induce or otherwise offer employment or engagement as an
independent contractor to, or hire or engage, any Person who is or was an
employee of any Company Entity or Retained Subsidiary who is a Continuing
Employee, unless such Person has been separated from his or her employment or
other relationship with Purchaser and each of its Affiliates (including the
Company Entities) for a period of at least six (6) consecutive months;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict any Person from
making general solicitations of employment in the ordinary course that are not
specifically directed to such employees. Seller and Parent shall use their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that any successor to all or substantially
all of the equity, business or assets of any such respective Subsidiaries
acquires such equity, business or assets subject to the restrictions set forth
in this Section 6.15(b) during such twenty-four (24) month restricted period.

(c)During the period of twenty-four (24) months from and after the Closing
Date, each of Purchaser and the Company shall not, and each of Purchaser and
the Company shall cause its respective Affiliates, including the Company
Entities, not to, directly or indirectly, including through any other Person,
solicit, induce or otherwise offer employment or engagement as an independent
contractor to, or hire or engage, any Person who is or was an employee of
Seller, any Company Entity or Retained Subsidiary who is not a Continuing
Employee, unless such Person has been separated from his or her employment or
other relationship with Seller, the applicable Retained Subsidiary, or an
Affiliate of Seller or the applicable Retained Subsidiary, for a period of at
least six (6) consecutive months; provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not restrict any Person from making general solicitations of employment in the
ordinary course that are not specifically directed to such employees. This
Section 6.15(c) is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable directly by,
each Retained Subsidiary and each successor to all or substantially all of the
equity, business or assets of each Retained Subsidiary.

Section 6.16 WARN Act. Purchaser shall not, nor shall it permit the Company
Entities to, at any time during the 90-day period immediately following the
Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act, without complying in all
material respects with the notice requirements and all other provisions of
applicable Law. 

Section 6.17 Wrong Pockets. To the extent that, following the Closing, a party
discovers any asset intended to be transferred to the other party or one of
its Affiliates pursuant to the Corporate Reorganization (each, an "Omitted
Asset"), such discovering party shall promptly notify the other party, and the
applicable party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) promptly assign
and transfer all right, title and interest in and to such Omitted Asset to
Purchaser or its designated assignee, and (ii) pending such transfer, (a) hold
in trust such Omitted Asset and provide to the other party or its designated
assignee all of the benefits associated with the ownership of the Omitted
Asset, and (B) cause such Omitted Asset to be used or retained as may be
reasonably instructed by the other party (subject to compliance with
applicable laws).

Section 6.18 Existing Indenture. Capitalized terms used in this Section 6.18
that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings assigned to them in
the Existing Indenture.

(a)Seller shall cause the Company to provide notice to the Trustee of the
Company's election to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 3.07 of the
Existing Indenture on or prior to the Closing Date, in form and substance
required by Section 3.01 of the Existing Indenture, and in connection
therewith Seller shall cause the Company to request that the Trustee provide a
notice of redemption to each Holder of Notes at least 30 days, but not more
than 60 days, before the notes redemption date set forth therein (such date,
the "Notes Redemption Date"), in form and substance required by Section 3.03
of the Existing Indenture. Such notice may condition such redemption election
upon the precedent occurrence of the Closing, as permitted pursuant to Section
3.07(f) of the Existing Indenture.

(b)At the Closing, and in any event prior to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, on the Company's behalf, deposit with the
Trustee or Paying Agent cash in the amount required pursuant to Section 3.05
of the Existing Indenture (which amount, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
take into account the redemption prices set forth in Section 3.06(e) of the
Existing Indenture, shall include interest accrued through the Notes
Redemption Date, and shall be included in the calculation of Closing
Indebtedness).

Section 6.19 Further Assurances. If prior to or at any time after the Closing
any further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to fully effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties shall take
such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other party may reasonably request. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Parent and
Seller shall provide and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company
Entities) to provide such cooperation in connection with the final binding of
the RandW Insurance Policy as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser.

(3) has not been waived by Seller and (iii) Seller has delivered written
notice to Purchaser of such breach, inaccuracy or failure, as applicable.

(e)By Purchaser, if (i) Purchaser, on the date of termination, is not in

to perform in all material respects its obligations, covenants or agreements
under this Agreement, (ii) (A) there is a breach or inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties of Seller or Parent set forth in this Agreement
and such breach or inaccuracy (1) would result in the failure of the condition
precedent set forth in Section 7.02 to be satisfied and (2) is incapable of
being cured or has not been cured by the Outside Date, and (3) has not been
waived by Purchaser or (B) Seller, Parent or the Company shall have failed to
perform in any material respect any material obligation under this 

Agreement required to be performed by any such party prior to the Closing and
such failure (1) would result in the failure of the condition precedent set
forth in Section 7.02 to be satisfied, (2) is incapable of being cured or has
not been cured by the Outside Date and (3) has not been waived by Purchaser
and (iii) Purchaser has delivered written notice to Seller of such breach,
inaccuracy or failure, as applicable.

(f)By (i) Purchaser, effective as of 5:00 pm pacific time on the last day of
the Interim Breach Review Period, if Purchaser shall have timely delivered
written notice of termination during the applicable Interim Breach Review
Period in accordance with Section 6.11(b)(iii)(1), or (ii) Seller, effective
as of 5:00 pm pacific time on the last day of the Interim Breach Standstill
Period, if Seller shall have timely delivered written notice of termination
during the applicable Interim Breach Standstill Period in accordance with
Section 6.11(b)(iii)(2).

(g)By Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if on or prior to the Outside
Date (i) Seller, on the date of such termination, is not in material breach of
any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in
this Agreement, (ii) Purchaser is not entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01, (iii) the conditions set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided such
conditions would reasonably be expected to have been satisfied as of such
date) and Purchaser is required to consummate the Closing hereunder, (iv)
Seller has delivered to Purchaser a certificate wherein Seller has certified
in writing that Parent and Seller are ready to consummate the Closing within
the later of (A) five (5) Business Days following receipt of such certificate
from Seller and (B) the Outside Date and (v) Purchaser fails to consummate the
Closing within five (5) Business Days following receipt of such certification.

Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any Liability or obligation on the part of
any party hereto, except that (i) the terms and conditions set forth in this
Article VIII and in Article X (other than Section 10.09) shall continue to
remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such termination, and (ii)
nothing contained herein shall relieve any party for any fraud, breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination.

Section 8.02 Purchaser Termination Fee. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or Section 8.01(g), and in connection
therewith a Financing Failure Event has occurred, then Purchaser shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Seller a termination fee of $20,000,000 in the aggregate
in cash in immediately available funds (the "Purchaser Termination Fee") as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within five (5)
Business Days following such termination), it being understood that in no
event shall Purchaser be required to pay (or cause to be paid) the Purchaser
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or Section 8.01(g), and in connection
therewith a Financing Failure Event has not occurred, then Seller, at its sole
option, may seek any remedies available to it, including specific performance
pursuant to Section 10.09; provided, that if Seller so desires in its sole
discretion, it may at any time following such termination elect in a writing
delivered to Purchaser liquidated damages in lieu of specific performance or
other monetary damages available to Seller, and in such event Purchaser shall
pay (or cause to be paid) 

to Seller a liquidated damages fee of $20,000,000 in the aggregate in cash in
immediately available funds (the "Purchaser Damages Fee") as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days
following notice of such election), it being understood that in no event shall
Purchaser be required to pay (or cause to be paid) (i) the Purchaser Damages
Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) both the Purchaser Termination Fee and
the Purchaser Damages Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(d) or Section 8.01(g) and the Purchaser Termination Fee, or at Seller's
election the Purchaser Damages Fee, is paid to Seller, or as directed by
Seller to another Person, the payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee or the
Purchaser Damages Fee, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 8.03 shall be
deemed to be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller, Parent and the Company
against the Purchaser and its Affiliates for any Losses, Liabilities or other
damages suffered in connection with this Agreement (including as a result of
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
provision in this Agreement), (ii) upon payment of the Purchaser Termination
Fee, or at Seller's election the Purchaser Damages Fee, none of Purchaser, its
Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
(iii) upon payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, or at Seller's election
the Purchaser Damages Fee, none of Seller, Parent nor the Company shall have
any further recourse against Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt
Financing) and Seller, Parent or the Company shall cause any litigation,
proceeding or similar Proceedings pending against Purchaser, its Affiliates or
the Debt Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement and/or any of the
transaction contemplated hereby to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, but
in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter. The parties hereto
agree that the Purchaser Termination Fee, and the Purchaser Damages Fee if
elected by Seller, is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 and
Section 8.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
this Agreement. Seller shall be entitled to seek both a grant of specific
performance if permitted pursuant to Section 10.09, and monetary damages or
the payment of the Purchaser Damages Fee under this Section 8.03, but under no
circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and an award of money damages, including all or any
portion of the Purchaser Damages Fee or Purchaser Termination Fee.

Section 8.04 Limitations on Liabilities.

(a)In no event shall any of Seller, Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates seek or permit to be sought
any Losses or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind from any
Affiliate of Purchaser, including, following the Closing, the Company Entities
in connection with this Agreement (including the Debt Financing) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Seller acknowledge and agree that
neither they nor any of their Affiliates have any right of recovery against,
and no personal liability shall attach to, any Affiliate of Purchaser, whether
by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or
limited liability company veil, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law, or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Closing, recourse against
Purchaser for the Purchaser Termination Fee, or at Seller's election the
Purchaser Damages Fee (in each case if, when and to 

the extent payable under this ARTICLE VIII (and subject to the limitations set
forth herein)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of monetary
damages of Seller, Parent and the Company (subject to the limitations set
forth herein) in respect of any Liabilities or obligations of Purchaser
arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Closing, in the event of a Financing Failure Event (i) Seller's receipt of the
Purchaser Termination Fee is the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller, Parent,
their respective Subsidiaries and their respective stockholders, affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and representatives against Purchaser or any of
its representatives, including any investment banker, financial advisor, Debt
Financing Source, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent, representative
or affiliate, (ii) the maximum aggregate liability of Purchaser or its
Affiliates for monetary damages in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to the amount of the
Purchaser Termination Fee, (iii) in no event shall any of Seller, Parent, the
Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates seek or
permit to be sought any monetary damages of any kind in excess of the
Purchaser Termination Fee, including, without limitation, (a) any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to
be consummated, (b) the termination of this Agreement, or (c) any liabilities
or obligations arising under this Agreement, and (iv) upon payment to Seller
of such Purchaser Termination Fee, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any further liability or obligation to Seller, Parent or the
Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event shall Seller, Parent or the Company be
entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or judgment against the Debt Financing
Sources, including for any type of damage relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. This Section 8.04(b) relates solely to monetary damages in
the event of a Financing Failure Event and does not limit the rights or
liabilities of the parties hereto in the event that a party hereto is entitled
to seek specific performance in accordance with (and to the extent permitted
by) this Agreement and a court of competent jurisdiction specifically enforces
the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement in accordance with
the terms and conditions herein; provided, however, that in no event shall any
of Seller, Parent, the Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates be entitled to receive both monetary damages and
specific performance in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

ARTICLE IX.

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.01 Survival. (a) The Specified Representations and Warranties shall
survive the Closing for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date; (b)
the representations and warranties of Parent and Seller contained in Article
III and Article IV (other than the Specified Representations and Warranties)
shall survive the Closing for a period of one year from the Closing Date; (c)
the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in Article V, and
the covenants and agreements of the parties contained herein that contemplate
actions to be taken only on or prior to Closing, shall survive the Closing for
a period of one year from the Closing Date; and (d) the covenants and
agreements of the parties contained herein that contemplate actions to be
taken after Closing shall survive the Closing and continue in effect until
ninety (90) days following expiration in accordance with their terms; and,
other than as set forth in Section 9.08, no claims 

may be brought with respect to each of the matters described in the foregoing
clauses (a) through (d) hereunder or in any forum after such applicable date.
It is the express intent of the parties that if the applicable survival period
for an item as contemplated by this Section 9.01 is longer or shorter than the
statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such item,
then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such
item shall be extended or decreased to the increased survival period
contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this Section 9.01 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement
are the result of arms'-length negotiation among the parties and that they
intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties. The
foregoing, and the other provisions of this Article IX, notwithstanding, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, other than in respect of the
Specified Representations and Warranties, the RandW Insurance Policy (to the
extent coverage therefor is available thereunder) shall be the first source of
recovery for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made in Article III or Article IV, prior to and in precedence of any recovery
from the Escrow Amount, and recourse to the Escrow Amount shall be the sole
source of recovery from Parent or Seller.

Section 9.02 Indemnification by Parent and Seller. From and after the Closing,
subject to the limitations in this Article IX, Parent and Seller shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and the Company Entities
(collectively, the "Purchaser Parties") for any Losses directly or indirectly
resulting from or arising out of:

(a)any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Seller or Parent in Article III and Article IV (other than the Specified
Representations and Warranties) or in any certificate in respect thereof
delivered by Seller or Parent pursuant to this Agreement;

(b)any breach of or inaccuracy in any Specified Representations and Warranties
or in any certificate in respect of the Specified Representations and
Warranties delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

(c)any breach or default in the performance by Seller of any covenant,
obligation or agreement contained herein;

(d)any Indemnified Taxes, but only to the extent such Indemnified Taxes were
not included in the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital or Closing
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.04);

(e)any Company Transaction Costs (but only to the extent not paid at or prior
to the Closing or to the extent not included in the calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital or Closing Company Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.04);

(f)any Indebtedness (but only to the extent not paid at or prior to the
Closing or to the extent not included in the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.04); and

(g)the Corporate Reorganization Liabilities and any Liabilities of the
Retained Subsidiaries or arising from or relating to the Retained Business. 

Section 9.03 Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, subject
to the limitations in this Article IX, Purchaser and the Company Entities
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and Seller from any Losses directly
or indirectly resulting from or arising out of:

(a)any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Purchaser in Article V or in any certificate in respect thereof delivered by
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement; and

(b)any breach or default in the performance by Purchaser of any covenant,
obligation or agreement contained herein.

Section 9.04 Limitations on Indemnification. In no event will Parent and
Seller have any Liability, or be required to indemnify or pay pursuant to (a)
Section 9.02 for any amounts that are in the aggregate in excess of
$200,000,000 in the aggregate, (b) Section 9.02(a) for any Losses that are not
in excess of $40,000 in respect of any single matter or claim or series of
clearly related matters or claims (provided that if Losses otherwise
recoverable but for this Section 9.04(b) aggregate to greater than $1,000,000,
this Section 9.04(b) shall be ignored for any subsequent Losses), (c) Section
9.02(a) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses relating thereto for which
the Seller and Parent would be liable exceeds the Deductible, and then only to
the extent of such excess, (d) Section 9.02(a) other than by recourse to the
Escrow Amount and (e) Section 9.02(a) for any amounts that exceed the Cap.

Section 9.05 Direct Claims for Indemnity. Whenever a claim for Losses shall
arise for which one party (the "Indemnified Party") shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder, (a) Indemnified Party shall notify the other party
(the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of such claim and (b) such notice shall
specify in reasonable detail such facts known to Indemnified Party giving rise
to such indemnity rights and shall estimate the amount of the Liability
arising therefrom (if reasonably known and quantifiable), which estimate is
advisory in nature and shall not be binding; provided, however, that the
failure to give notice as herein provided shall not relieve Indemnifying Party
of its obligation to indemnify Indemnified Party except to the extent that
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced in its ability to
defend such claim. If Indemnified Party shall be duly notified of such
dispute, the parties shall attempt to settle and compromise the same, or if
unable to do so within twenty (20) days of Indemnifying Party's delivery of
notice of a dispute, the Indemnified Party may institute appropriate
proceedings to resolve such dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnified Party is Purchaser and it is pursuing such claim solely against
the RandW Insurance Policy (at its option), the procedures set forth in this
Section 9.05 shall not be given effect during the pendency of such claim
against the RandW Insurance Policy. Any rights of indemnification established by
reason of such settlement, compromise or proceedings shall be paid and
satisfied by Indemnifying Party within five (5) days of such resolution.

Section 9.06 Third Party Claims.

(a)If any third party shall notify any party with respect to any matter (a
"Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against any other party under this Article IX, then the Indemnified Party
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within twenty
(20) days of notice thereof, notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; provided, however, that (i) if the Indemnifying Party is Parent
and/or Seller, the Indemnified Party need only notify Seller, and (ii) the
failure to give notice as herein provided shall not relieve Indemnifying Party
of its obligation 

to indemnify Indemnified Party except to the extent that Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced in its ability to defend such claim.
Subject to Section 9.06(b), if the Indemnifying Party (1) provides the
Indemnified Party with written notice of such election within thirty (30) days
of the date the Indemnifying Party receives notice of such Third-Party Claim
and (2) such claim is agreed by the Parties (as determined by each of them
reasonably and in good faith) to more likely not be the responsibility of the
Indemnifying Party, or if the Parties are unable to come to such an agreement,
the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to indemnify the Indemnified Party
pursuant to the terms and conditions (including limitation) of this Agreement,
then such Indemnifying Party will have the right at its expense to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice of recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
and Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate to the extent reasonably
requested by Indemnifying Party in the defense or prosecution thereof and
shall furnish such records, information (that are under its control) and
testimony and attend all such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith, in each case, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. If
Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and so elects to, assume the defense of
such claim, Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel
in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of Indemnified Party. If Indemnifying Party is entitled to and has
assumed the defense of any claim against Indemnified Party, for so long as the
Indemnifying Party is reasonably diligently defending such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any claim for which
indemnification has been sought and is available hereunder only upon receiving
the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) except if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement, the Indemnified Party is expressly and
unconditionally released (including for these purposes, the Company or its
Subsidiaries) in writing from all Liabilities and obligations with respect to
such claim with prejudice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim or
otherwise disputes Indemnified Party's right to indemnification, Indemnified
Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense of such claim
through counsel of its choice, the cost of which shall be at Indemnifying
Party's expense in the event that Indemnified Party's right of indemnification
is ultimately established through settlement, compromise or appropriate
proceeding.

(b)Notwithstanding Section 9.06(a), Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to assume control of such defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained
by Indemnified Party (i) unless the Third Party Claim involves only money
damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief or (ii) if
(A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal or quasi criminal Proceeding, indictment or allegation, (B) the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to
the Proceeding giving rise to such claim for indemnification would materially
injure the Indemnified Party's (including for these purposes, the Company's or
its Subsidiaries') reputation or future business prospects or customer or
supplier relations, (C) Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel in
writing that a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest exists between
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party, (D) the amount of such settlement
exceeds the maximum amount that such Indemnified Party 

would be entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of this Article
IX) in any material respect, or (E) the Indemnifying Party failed or is
failing to reasonably diligently prosecute or defend such claim. In addition,
this Section 9.06 shall not apply to any Third Party Claim concerning Taxes,
which instead shall be governed by Section 6.06.

Section 9.07 Recoveries. Any amount payable under this Article IX by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of (a) any amounts the Indemnified Party
actually recovers under applicable insurance policies in respect of such claim
or from third parties pursuant to indemnification (or otherwise) with respect
thereto (in each case net of any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the
collection of same, any deductible associated therewith, and Taxes imposed on
the amount of such recoveries, if any), and (b) net income Tax benefit
actually realized, in the form of a cash income Tax refund or a Tax deduction
reducing cash income Taxes otherwise due and payable by the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates; provided that such income Tax benefit is realized in a
Post-Closing Tax Period ending on or before the expiration of the last tax
year of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) that
includes December 31, 2021. The Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
duplicate recoveries for Losses arising out of a single set of related facts
(it being the intent of the parties to avoid "double-counting"); provided,
that the foregoing shall not restrict claims under any one or more
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement that may be applicable to such facts or circumstances. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be entitled to
recover on any claim for indemnification with respect to any matter that was
included in the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Company Transaction Costs as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.04. Indemnification payments of Parent and
Seller with respect to Section 9.02 (other than payments in respect of (i)
federal, state, local or foreign transfer Taxes or (ii) Indemnified Taxes in
respect of income, which shall first be made by Parent and Seller, including
as may be required by Section 6.06) shall first be made by application for
recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy (to the extent coverage therefor is
available thereunder), and then (unless Seller otherwise notifies Purchaser in
writing) from the Escrow Amount until the Escrow Amount is exhausted, and then
by Parent and Seller (if applicable) on a joint and several basis, in each
case on the terms and subject to the limitations provided in this Agreement.
In furtherance of the intent of the Parties in respect of the immediately
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall expend commercially reasonable efforts
present claims to the insurers under the RandW Insurance Policy and to realize
on the same.

Section 9.08 Survival of Indemnity. Any matter as to which a claim notice has
been submitted in the manner provided by Section 9.05 or 9.06 that is pending
or unresolved at the end of such applicable survival period set forth in
Section 9.01 shall continue to be covered by this Article IX, notwithstanding
the expiration of the applicable survival period, until such matter is finally
terminated or otherwise resolved under this Agreement and any amounts payable
hereunder are finally determined and paid; provided, however, that any such
matter and any such claim shall be deemed irrevocably withdrawn if such matter
and such claim is contingent and no litigation has been commenced within six
months (with respect to matters other than in respect of Specified
Representations and Warranties) or twelve months (with respect to matters in
respect of Specified Representations and Warranties) following the end of the
survival period applicable thereto set forth in Section 9.01. 

Section 9.09 Limitation on Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, neither party will be liable for any punitive or exemplary damages,
damages related to loss of reputation, or damages that were not reasonably
foreseeable and recoverable in a claim for contract damages; and each party
hereby releases and waives any claims against the other party regarding such
damages; provided, however, that this Section 9.09 shall not apply or
otherwise preclude the recovery of damages by any Indemnified Party in respect
of such damages awarded to a third party in a Third Party Claim. Unless
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, no party hereto shall have
any right to set off any amount to which it claims to be entitled from any
other party, including any amounts that may be owed under this Article IX or
otherwise, against amounts otherwise payable under any provision of this
Agreement. No Indemnified Party shall have any right to recover from any
Indemnifying Party any Loss to the extent it is not an actual Loss, cause of
action or claim that such Indemnified Party has sustained, paid or incurred.

Section 9.10 Exclusive Remedy. Except as set forth in Section 10.09, Article
II, Article VIII or in respect of remedies that cannot be waived as a matter
of law, the indemnification provisions in this Article IX shall be the
exclusive remedy of Purchaser, the Company Entities, Parent and Seller with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that this Section 9.10 shall not limit any claims by, or remedies of, the
Purchaser in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by or on behalf of any
Seller, Parent or Company Entity in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 9.11 Adjustments to Purchase Price. All indemnity payments made
hereunder shall be treated by the parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all Tax, accounting and other purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

Section 9.12 Materiality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, for purposes of determining after the Closing whether there has been
an inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or in each certificate
delivered pursuant hereto with respect to the representations and warranties,
and the amount of any Losses with respect thereto, each such representation,
warranty, and each certificate delivered pursuant hereto with respect to such
representations and warranties shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to any "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar standard
or qualification contained in such representation or warranty (as if such
standard or qualification were deleted from such representation or warranty).
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.12 is not applicable to, and shall
not in and of itself be taken into account in respect of, the determination as
to whether there has been fraud or an intentional misrepresentation by Seller,
as the matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule and the representations
made by Seller on the date hereof and on the Closing Date expressly do not
take into account the provisions of this Section 9.12 and expressly do take
into account and give effect to any "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"
or similar standard or qualification contained in such representation or
warranty.

Section 9.13 Knowledge. The right to indemnification, payment of Losses of an
Indemnified Party or for other remedies based on any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of an Indemnifying Party contained in or made pursuant
to this Agreement shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired), by
such Indemnified Party with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
(ii) the waiver of 

any condition in this Agreement based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
agreement.

Section 9.14 Circular Recovery. Parent and Seller shall not be entitled to
make any claim for indemnification or recovery against any Purchaser Parties
(or any of their respective insurance policies or insurance carriers) by
reason of the fact that Parent or Seller were a controlling Person,
shareholder, director, employee or representative of the Company Entities or
any Affiliate thereof or were serving as such for another Person at the
request of any such entity (whether such claim is for damages or losses of any
kind or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a Purchaser Party
against Parent or Seller under this Agreement or otherwise relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to any claim
brought by a Purchaser Party against Parent or Seller under this Agreement or
otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Parent and Seller expressly waives any right of subrogation,
contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against the Company
Entities and any Affiliate of any of the foregoing following the Closing with
respect to or relating to any amounts owed to or by the Parent or Seller
pursuant to this Article IX or otherwise.

Section 9.15 RandW Insurance Policy. The RandW Insurance Policy is a Contract
between the Purchaser and the insurers party thereto separate and apart from
this Agreement. As such, none of the limitations or exceptions set forth in
this Article IX shall in any way limit, affect, restrict, modify or impair the
ability of the Purchaser to make claims under or recover under the RandW
Insurance Policy.

ARTICLE X.

Section 10.03 Non-Reliance; No Other Representations.

(a)Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the specific
representations and warranties expressly made by Seller in Articles III and IV
of this Agreement and the certificates delivered in respect thereof, neither
Seller nor the Company are making any representations or warranties, expressed
or implied, at Law or in equity, with respect to the Company Entities or any
of the their respective businesses, assets, liabilities, operations,
prospects, or condition (financial or otherwise), including with respect to
(i) merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any assets of the
Company Entities or (ii) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or
made available to Purchaser of future revenues, future results of operations 

(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) of the Company Entities or the future business and
operations of the Company Entities. Purchaser specifically disclaims that it
is relying upon or has relied upon any such other representations or
warranties and acknowledges and agrees that Seller has expressly disclaimed
any such other representation or warranty made by Seller, Parent or any other
Person.

(b)Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning the Company Entities, (ii) has been furnished with or given
adequate access to such information about the Company Entities as it has
requested and (iii) will not assert any claim against any Seller or any
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant, counsel, accountants,
investment banker or representative of any Seller or any Company Entity, or
seek or otherwise attempt to hold any such Persons liable for, any
inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to information (other
than claims against Seller and/or Parent for fraud or based on the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement) furnished by
Seller, any Company Entity or any such other Person concerning the Company
Entities.

Section 10.04 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
hereto, whether by operation of Law or otherwise, absent the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that (a) Seller may
after the Closing, upon delivery of written notice to Purchaser, assign all or
any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate or to its
direct or indirect members or partners (without being relieved of its
obligations hereunder), or to a successor-in-interest, (b) Purchaser may
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a subsidiary without
being relieved of its obligations hereunder, and (c) Purchaser and the Company
may at or after the Closing, upon delivery of written notice to Seller, assign
this Agreement (x) in whole or in part as collateral to its applicable debt
financing providers and (y) in whole to a successor-in-interest to all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company Entities.

Section 10.05 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State; provided
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims or causes of action (whether
at law or equity, in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) against the Debt
Financing Sources shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
law of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of
such state.

Section 10.06 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the
parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its successors or
assigns shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware or in any federal court located in the State of Delaware, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each parties hereto agrees that
any legal action or proceeding against the Debt Financing Sources shall be
brought exclusively in the United States District Court of the Southern
District of New York or any New York State court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject
matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause
of action arising out of 

this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business
in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of
the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, all right to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Debt Financing).

Section 10.07 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Purchaser and Seller. At any time before the Closing Date, any party hereto
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only as against such party and
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 8.03,
Section 8.04(b), Section 10.05, Section 10.06, Section 10.13, Section 10.16,
and this Section 10.07 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment or waiver of such provision would modify the substance of the
aforementioned provisions) may not be amended or waived in a manner that is
materially adverse to any Debt Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source.

Section 10.08 Personal Liability. This Agreement shall not create or be deemed
to create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of, or
any recourse against, any direct or indirect member, partner, stockholder,
officer, director, employee, representative or investor of any party (other
than any such Person who is also a party to this Agreement), including under
theories such as "conspiracy", "acting in concert", "aiding and abetting" or
providing "substantial assistance". All proceedings, obligations, Losses or
causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or
relate in any manner to (a) this Agreement, (b) the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement
and (d) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated,
in each case, may only be made against (and are those solely of) the Persons
that are expressly named as parties hereto to the extent set forth herein. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto
covenants, agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives, that no recourse under this
Agreement or otherwise shall be had against (i) any past, present or future
direct or indirect equity holder, controlling Person, Affiliate, member,
manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator or
representative of any party hereto (unless such Person is also a party to this
Agreement) or (ii) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling Person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited
partner, stockholder, incorporator or representative of any of the foregoing
(unless such Person is also a party to this Agreement), and none of the
foregoing shall have any Liability hereunder (in each case, whether in tort,
contract or otherwise). 

Section 10.09 Enforcement.

(a)The parties acknowledge that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of
this Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages.
Accordingly, subject to the provisions of Article VIII, each of the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereby waives (i) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties
hereto agree Seller and Parent shall be entitled to enforce specifically
Purchaser's obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing), in each case,
only if (x) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02
have been satisfied (other than those conditions which are to be satisfied by
the delivery of documents or taking of any other action at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing and,
in addition, only if those conditions could be satisfied if the Closing were
to occur on the date Seller or Parent were first seeking specific performance)
or waived, and (y) all of other conditions to the granting of such specific
performance set forth in Section 10.09(b) have been satisfied.

(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties acknowledge
and agree that the Seller and Parent shall be entitled to specific performance
(or any other equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with Section 2.03, in each case on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, if, but only if, all of the following conditions
have been satisfied: (i) the time period set forth in the proviso to the first
sentence of Section 2.03 has ended and Purchaser is required to complete the
Closing pursuant to Section 2.03, (ii) all of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall have been satisfied (other
than those conditions which are to be satisfied by the delivery of documents
or taking of any other action at the Closing, but which conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time), (iii) each of the
Company, Seller and Parent have confirmed in writing to Purchaser that they
are ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, (iv) Purchaser has
failed to consummate the Closing in breach of Section 2.03 and (v) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing in an amount not
less than $250,000,000, on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments (the satisfaction of clauses (i) through (iv) above and failure of
clause (v) above being a "Financing Failure Event").

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing (or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement), in no event shall Seller, Parent and/or the Company be entitled
to, or be permitted to seek specific performance against any Debt Financing
Source.

Section 10.10 Headings; Construction. The Section headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, 

this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
maximum extent possible.

Section 10.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with all schedules
and Exhibits), the Escrow Agreement, the Transition Services Agreements, the
Trademark License Agreements, the Contract Manufacturing Agreements, the
Subleases and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
and supersede any and all other prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof. Prior drafts of this Agreement and any other
document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby will be deemed not to
provide any evidence as to the meaning of any provision hereof or the intent
of the parties with respect thereto.

Section 10.13 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 6.07, Article IX (including with respect to the Purchaser
Parties) and Section 10.14, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of
Section 8.03, Section 8.04(b), Section 10.05, Section 10.06, Section 10.07,
Section 10.16 and this Section 10.13 and any related definitions will inure to
the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources and their successors and assigns,
each of whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof (it being
understood and agreed that Section 8.03, Section 8.04(b), Section 10.05,
Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.16 and this Section 10.13 and any
related definitions will be enforceable by the Debt Financing Sources and
their respective successors and assigns).

Section 10.14 Conflict and Privilege Waiver. At the Closing, any attorney-
client relationship between Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP and the applicable
Company Entities shall terminate, and in the future Morgan, Lewis and Bockius
LLP may represent Seller (and any of its Affiliates, successors and assigns)
in any matter (including any dispute, negotiation, controversy, arbitration or
litigation which may arise between any such Person on the one hand, and
Purchaser or the Company Entities (and any of their respective Affiliates,
successors and assigns), on the other hand) with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, even if such matters are directly
adverse to the Company Entities and their respective Affiliates, successors
and assigns, and each of the Company and Purchaser hereby consents to such
representation and hereby waives any duty of confidentiality or attorney-
client privilege which may have arisen as a result of the representation by
Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP of any Company Entity or Seller (or any of their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns) solely in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP
shall not be obligated to 

notify any Person of any such representation as it arises. Further, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence in respect
of all communications between Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP on the one hand, and
Seller and (prior to the Closing) the Company and the other applicable Company
Entities, on the other hand, that solely relate to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, reside with Seller, and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Purchaser or the Company Entities after the applicable Closing.

Section 10.15 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement may be executed by delivery of a facsimile copy of
an executed signature page with the same force and effect as the delivery of
an originally executed signature page. In the event any party delivers a
facsimile copy of a signature page to this Agreement, such party shall deliver
an originally executed signature page within five (5) days of another party's
request; provided, however, that the failure to deliver any such originally
executed signature page shall not affect the validity of the signature page
delivered by facsimile, which has and shall continue to have the same force
and effect as the originally executed signature page.

Section 10.16 Debt Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except for the assertion by Purchaser of its
rights set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) neither any party nor any
of their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, officers, directors,
employees and representatives, nor any Person claiming by, through or under
any such Person, shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing
Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (ii) no Debt
Financing Source shall have any Liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to any Party or any of their respective Affiliates, equityholders,
members, officers, directors, employees and representatives, or any Person
claiming by, through or under any such Person for any obligations or
Liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise.

Section 10.17 Mutual Releases.

behalf of each of its respective Retained Subsidiaries, hereby releases each

costs, loans, debts and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs actually
incurred), compensation or deferred compensation of any nature whatsoever,
known, unknown or presently unknowable, contingent or absolute which releasing
Persons ever had, now has, or hereafter can, shall or may have against the
Company Entities that arise based on Seller's capacity as the owner of the
Shares prior to the Closing, in each case except for (i) any rights of 

the parties under this Agreement or any other agreements entered into in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or after the
Closing Date, or (ii) any claim that cannot be released or waived as a matter
of law or any right to enforce this release.

(b)Effective as of the Closing, the Company, on its behalf and on behalf of
each of the Company Entities, hereby releases Seller from all charges,

contingent or absolute which such Company Entity ever had, now has, or
hereafter can, shall or may have against Seller, in each case except for (i)
any rights of the parties under this Agreement or any other agreements entered
into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or after
the Closing Date, or (ii) any claim that cannot be released or waived as a
matter of law or any right to enforce this release.

(c)Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that the releases in this Section
10.17 include claims that such Person does not know or suspect to exist in its
favor at the time of the giving of the foregoing releases which, if known by
it, might affect its decision regarding the releases set forth herein, and
that it might hereafter discover facts or documents in addition to or
different from those which it now knows or believes to be true or exist with
respect to the subject matter of any of the foregoing releases, and that any
such discovery shall not affect the foregoing releases.
