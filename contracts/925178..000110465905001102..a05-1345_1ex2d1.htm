Effective Time shall be converted into one newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 

  

## 3.2 _Cancellation of Parent and Acquiror-Owned Shares_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the

be made or consideration delivered in respect therefor.

  

## 

  

## 3.3 _Conversion of Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company
Share, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than any Company Shares to be cancelled pursuant to

converted automatically into the right to receive from Parent (or a
Subsidiary thereof) an amount in cash equal to Thirteen and 25/100 Dollars
($13.25) (the " **Merger Consideration** "), payable by Parent (or a
Subsidiary thereof) to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate
(a " **Certificate** ") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section
3.4; and no other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable on or in
exchange therefor.

  

## 

  

## 3.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company as agent (the "
**Exchange Agent** ") for the benefit of holders of Company Shares for the
purpose of exchanging, pursuant to this Article III, Certificates
representing Company Shares for the Merger Consideration. On or before
the Closing Date, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
all Company Shares pursuant to this Article III (the " **Exchange Fund** "),
and except as contemplated by Section 3.4(e), Section 3.4(f) or Section
3.4(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Agent shall invest such Merger Consideration as directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid

by Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the

(" **Record Holder** ") immediately prior to the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall be in customary form and specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), for use in the
exchange contemplated by this Section 3.4. Upon surrender of a Certificate
to the

  

   

     
   

  



  

### Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the
holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article III in respect of the Company
Shares represented by the Certificate (after giving effect to any required
withholding Tax).  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4,
each such Certificate representing Company Shares shall be deemed, after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid on any such delivery of cash to be
paid pursuant to this Article III upon such delivery.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Further Rights in Company Shares_.  Holders of Company Shares
shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company,
other than to receive (i) any dividend or other distribution with respect to
the Company Shares with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the Merger Consideration provided in Section 3.3. All cash paid upon
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company
Shares represented thereby. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the Companys stock transfer books of
any Company Shares, other than transfers that occurred before the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
Company Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.4.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Alternate Endorsement_. If payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of Company Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not payable.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Upon demand by Parent, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to Surviving Corporation any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 3.4 (with any interest and earnings thereon) that remains
undistributed to Record Holders twelve (12) months after the Effective Time.
Record Holders who have not complied with this Section 3.4 prior to
the demand by Parent shall thereafter look only to Surviving Corporation
for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

### 

  

### (f) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable hereunder to

  

   

     
   

  

### 

  

### any holder of any Certificate any amounts that it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been or is claimed to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming that a Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to that
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver to such Person in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the proper amount of the
Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Exchange of Acquiror Stock Certificates_.  Immediately after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to Parent in exchange
for the certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented all the outstanding Acquiror Common Shares that were converted
into the right to receive shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with Section 3.1, share certificates registered in the name of
Parent, representing the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation to which Parent is so entitled by virtue of Section 3.1.

  

### 

  

## 3.5 _Company Stock Options_. With respect to each outstanding
Company Option, the Board of Directors of the Company shall provide a 30-day
period prior to the consummation of the Merger during which time each
outstanding Company Option shall be exercisable to the extent vested. At the
Effective Time, each unexercised Company Option (whether vested or unvested)
shall be cancelled with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration
over (ii) the per share exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by
the number of Company Shares subject to such cancelled Company Options, as
such amount may be reduced by any applicable withholding Taxes.

  

## 

  

## 3.6 _Adjustments_.  If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the number of outstanding Company Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or the like other than pursuant to the
Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted
and, if and as appropriate, all other appropriate corresponding adjustments
shall be made.

maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)

Incorporation or By-laws or Acquirors Articles of Incorporation or By-laws,
(b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.3,
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
Law binding upon or applicable to Parent or the Acquiror or by which any of
their respective properties is bound or affected, (c) constitute a Default
under (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both could reasonably
be expected to become a Default) or give rise (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) to a right of

  

   

     
   

  



  

## termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration under any agreement,
contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, franchise, Permit or other
similar authorization or joint venture, limited liability or partnership
agreement or other instrument binding upon Acquiror, other than, in the case

## 

  

## 5.5 _Financing_.  Acquiror has delivered to the Company signed
counterpart(s) of the Credit Facilities Commitment Letter dated as of January
9, 2005 made by Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation (" **MLCC** "), Wachovia
Bank, National Association (" **WB** "), Wachovia Capital Investments, Inc.
(" **WCI** " and, together with (1) MLCC and WB and (2) up to two (2)
assignees of any or all of WCI, MLCC and/or WB that are Eligible Assignees
(as hereinafter defined), the " **Lenders** ") and Wachovia Capital Markets,
LLC (" **WCM** " ), and accepted by Parent, pursuant to which the Lenders
have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
provide or cause to be provided up to an aggregate of $1,195,000,000 of debt
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
**Bank Commitment Letter** "; and the financing referred to in the Bank
Commitment Letter is herein referred to as the " **Financing** "). The Bank
Commitment Letter has not been amended and is in full force and effect as of
the date hereof. The Acquiror shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, agree to any amendment or modification of the Bank Commitment
Letter that (i) reduces the respective commitments of the Lenders thereunder
upon receipt, acceptance and allocation of commitments of other lenders, (ii)
amends or modifies any of conditions precedent to the availability of the
commitments provided by the Lenders in a manner that is materially
more onerous or burdensome to the Acquiror to obtain the Financing provided
for in the Bank Commitment Letter, (iii) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing to an aggregate amount below that which is necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or (iv) change the identity of the
Lenders (other than the addition of two additional Lenders as contemplated in
subclause (2) above); provided that, without the prior consent of the
Company, the Bank Commitment Letter may be amended or modified to substitute
other lenders for any of the Lenders, so long as such substitute lenders are
among the financial institutions identified in the letter of even date with
this Agreement addressed by the Company to the Acquiror, MLCC, WB, WCI and
WCM (such financial institutions are referred to herein as "
**Eligible Assignees** ") or to add up to two (2) Eligible Assignees as
Initial Senior Secured Lenders and/or Initial Interim Lenders (both as
defined in the Bank Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof) (in
such case, the " **Bank Commitment Letter** " shall mean the Bank Commitment
Letter as so amended or modified; provided further that nothing herein shall
be construed to prevent the Acquiror from consenting to the receipt,
acceptance and allocation commitments with respect to the Financing so long
as the commitments of the Lenders with respect thereto are not
reduced thereby). The funds in the amounts set forth in the Bank Commitment
Letter (including the sources and uses of funds contemplated thereby
(including the cash on hand of the Company)) will be sufficient to enable
Acquiror and the Company to pay the Merger Consideration, to make all other
necessary payments by them in connection with the Merger (including the
repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of the Company) and to pay all
of the related fees and expenses, in each case as contemplated by the Bank
Commitment Letter (collectively, the " **Merger Funds** ").

## 5.6 _Finders  Fees_.  Other than fees and expenses to be borne by the
Surviving Corporation at the Closing and except for Merrill Lynch and Co. and
Wachovia Securities there is no investment banker, financial advisor, broker,
finder or other intermediary which has been retained by, or is authorized to
act on behalf of, the Parent, Acquiror or any Affiliate thereof, which might
be

  

   

     
   

  



  

## entitled to any fee or commission from the Parent, Acquiror, Company, any
Company Subsidiary, or of any of their respective Affiliates upon
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

such Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement (it being
understood than an Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement
by a Person who made an Acquisition Proposal prior to the date of

  

   

     
   

  



  

### this Agreement shall be considered a new Acquisition Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement) and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives (including any Representative of the Special Committee)
has violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.2, (B) such
Person shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company
on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or Parent than the
Confidentiality Agreement (including without limitation the standstill
provisions thereof), (C) each of the Board of Directors of the Company and
the Special Committee has determined in good faith by resolution duly
adopted, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and (D) within 24 hours after participating or engaging in any such
discussions or negotiations or disclosing or providing any such non-public
information or affording such access, the Company shall give Parent and
Acquiror written notice of the identity of such Person and the terms of the
Acquisition Proposal and, prior to or concurrently with disclosing or
providing any such non-public information, the Company shall disclose or
provide all such information to Acquiror. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and instruct their Representatives (including any
Representative of the Special Committee) to, immediately cease and cause to

### (b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section

inquiry or request and the identity of the Person making the same.  The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status and all
material terms (including any change to the material terms) of any
such Acquisition Proposal. Immediately upon determination by the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
deliver to Parent and Acquiror a written notice (a " **Notice of Superior
Proposal** ") advising them of such determination, specifying the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal, and providing Parent and Acquiror with a copy of the
Superior Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Special
Committee has adopted a resolution recommending the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Company Shareholders (the "
**Company Recommendation** "). Neither the Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall
be considered an adverse modification, provided that taking a neutral
position or no position with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer that
is an Acquisition Proposal for a period of time not in excess of thirty (30)
days after commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer shall not be
considered an adverse modification) or (ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in clause (i) or (ii) being referred to as a "
**Company Adverse Recommendation Change** ").  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if it reasonably determines in
good faith

  

   

     
   

  



  

### (following consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to do
so in order to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders
under applicable Law and the Company has fully complied with its obligations
under this Section 6.2; provided, however, that no Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made in response to an Acquisition Proposal
until after the third Business Day following Parents receipt of written
notice from the Company (an " **Adverse Recommendation Notice** ")
advising Parent that the Board of Directors or the Special Committee, as
applicable, has determined that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, that the Board of Directors or the Special Committee, as
applicable, intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and
containing all information required by Section 6.2(a), together with copies
of any written offer or proposal in respect of such Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three Business Day period. In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company and
the Special Committee shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation
Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such Acquisition Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal (which changes Company and Parent and
Acquiror agree, and agree to cause their respective Representatives, to
negotiate in good faith).  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors or the
Special Committee from taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a
position, or any information, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a
Third Party to the extent required under applicable Law (including Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act); provided that unless and
until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.1 hereof,
nothing in this sentence shall affect the obligations of the Company and its
Board of Directors under any other provision of this Agreement, including
Section 8.2(b).

  

### 

  

## 6.3 _The Notes_ _Tender Offer_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 10.1, at the request of the Parent, the Company will
commence a tender offer (the " **Notes Tender Offer** ") in respect of
the $225,000,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Senior
Subordinated Notes, as and at the time that the Parent shall request, with
the cooperation of the Parent. If commenced, the Notes Tender Offer shall be
in accordance with applicable Law and shall be solely on the terms and
conditions specified by the Parent; provided, that the Notes Tender Offer
(and all obligations to make any payments to holders of all or any portion of
Senior Subordinated Notes in connection therewith or to modify the terms or
provisions of any Senior Subordinated Notes) shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger, and shall terminate immediately upon
the termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. The Company
agrees not to consummate the Notes Tender Offer unless the Parent consents in
writing to such consummation. The Company agrees to use its reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Parent and, subject to the preceding sentence
and applicable Law, to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Notes Tender Offer if so requested by the Parent. If commenced, the Company
shall terminate the Notes Tender Offer upon request of the Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) If requested by the Parent, the Company shall promptly prepare an
Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement in connection with the
Notes Tender Offer in form and substance satisfactory to the Parent (as
amended from time to time, the " **Notes Offer to**

  

   

     
   

  



  

### **Purchase** "), together with related letters of transmittal and
similar ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all supplements
and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "
**Notes Tender Offer Documents** "), relating to the Notes Tender Offer, and
to disseminate to the record holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, and to
the extent known by the Company, the beneficial owners of the Senior
Subordinated Notes (collectively, the " **Noteholders** "), the Notes Tender
Offer Documents; provided, however, that prior to the dissemination thereof,
the Company shall consult with Parent with respect to the Notes Tender Offer
Documents and shall afford Parent reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.
Parent and the Acquiror shall provide the Company with any information for
inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer Documents which may be required under
applicable Law and which is reasonably requested by the Company. If at any
time prior to the acceptance of Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the
Notes Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by applicable Law
to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Notes Tender
Offer Documents, the Company will prepare and disseminate such amendment or
supplement; provided, however, that prior to such dissemination, the Company
shall consult with Parent with respect to such amendment or supplement and
shall afford Parent reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. The Company
will notify Parent at least 48 hours prior to the dissemination of the Notes
Tender Offer Documents, or 24 hours prior to the mailing of any amendment or
supplement thereto, to the Noteholders.

  

### 

  

## 6.4 _Real Property_ _Holding Company_. The Company shall provide to Parent,
at the Effective Time, a certificate from an officer of the Company, signed
under penalty of perjury, to the effect that the Company is not, and has not
been at any time during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

# **ARTICLE VII**

  



  

# ** _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUIROR_**

  



  

Parent and Acquiror, jointly and severally, agree as set forth below:

  



  

## 7.1 _Director and Officer_ _Liability_.

  

## 

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to
the extent provided under the Company Articles of Incorporation and the
Company By-laws and other indemnity arrangements in effect on the date hereof
(to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law), and shall not amend (in
a manner adverse to such present and former officers and directors) the
provisions relating to indemnification, exculpation or the liability of
directors in the Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company By-laws for
at least six (6) years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation to provide such
indemnification to the extent that it is ultimately determined that such
indemnification is prohibited under applicable Law. In respect of any
matter for which a present or

  

   

     
   

  



  

### former director or officer may be entitled to indemnification, subject to
receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a writing that sets forth (i) that
such person has a good faith belief that the person is entitled to
indemnification and (ii) an undertaking from such person to repay any amount
advanced hereunder if it is ultimately determined that the person is not
entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation shall advance to such
person all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by him or her within twenty
(20) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a written request for
such advance. The Surviving Corporation shall not require any security for
any such undertaking. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the current
policies of officers and directors liability insurance maintained by the
Company (the " **Current Policies** ") (provided that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially
sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable (the " **Replacement Policies** ")) in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Person currently covered by such Current Policies; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend, per annum, in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage (or such coverage as is available for 200% of
such annual premium); provided, further, that if the annual premium required
to provide the foregoing insurance exceeds 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company (which the Company represents and warrants is
equal to approximately $1,200,000 per annum), the Company shall provide as
much of such insurance as can be purchased for such premium, and, any present
or former officer or director, upon reasonable written notice thereof from
the Surviving Corporation, who desires to be covered by the Current Policies
may so elect and shall be covered by the Current Policies so long as such
former offer or director pays the portion of the premium for such Current
Policies in excess of the amount which the Surviving Corporation is obligated
to pay pursuant to this Section 7.1. Alternatively, with the consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company may
purchase "tail" insurance coverage covering a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, at a cost no greater than that set forth above, that
provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage
described above. The insurance purchased pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall
be prepaid at the Effective Time and shall be non-cancelable.

#### 10.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement has resulted in the failure of the Merger to
occur on or before the End Date; provided further, however, that if the
failure to consummate the Merger by such date is due solely to a delay in

Section 8.2 of this Agreement, (I) neither Parent nor the Company shall be

nonappealable and, prior to that termination, the parties shall have used
reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, the Law,
ruling, judgment, injunction, order or decree; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
results in the imposition of such ruling, judgment, injunction, order or
decree or the failure of such ruling, judgment, injunction, order or decree
to be resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable; or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) at the Company Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof at

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent

forth in Section 9.2(a) would not be satisfied, and such condition is
either incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or is not cured within
ten (10) Business Days after notice from the Company; provided, however, that
the Company shall not also then be in material breach of this Agreement;

  

### 

  

### (d) by Parent, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in
Section 9.3(a) would not be satisfied, and such condition is either incapable
of being satisfied by the End Date or is not cured within ten (10) Business
Days after notice from the Parent; provided, however, that Parent or Acquiror
shall not also then be in material breach of this Agreement; or

  

### 

  

### (e) by Parent, if:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Company shall have breached, in any material respects, any of
its obligations under Section 6.2 or Section 8.2 (other than breaches which
are cured within three (3) Business Days after notice from Parent) of this
Agreement;

  

   

     
   

  



  

#### (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall (A) withdraw, modify,
condition or qualify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
or Acquiror or approve or recommend to the Company Shareholders an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) approve or recommend that the Company Shareholders
tender their Company Shares in any tender or exchange offer that is an
Acquisition Proposal or fail, within thirty (30) days of commencement of any
such tender or exchange offer, to send to Company Shareholders a statement
disclosing that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer, or (C) approve a resolution or agree to do, or publicly propose to do,
any of the foregoing;

Company Shares; or

  

####

#### 

  

### (f) by the Company, if (i) the Company enters into a definitive agreement
for a Superior Proposal in accordance, and has otherwise complied, with
Section 6.2 hereof in all material respects, (ii) concurrently with such
termination, the Company shall have paid Parent the Termination Fee and (iii)
at the time and in accordance with Section 10.2, the Company pays Parent the

### 

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1(b)
through (f) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party

Amount required to be then paid by it pursuant to Section 10.2 of this
Agreement.

  



  

## 10.2 _Effect of_ _Termination_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company
or Acquiror as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the
Company or Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors
except (i) with respect to Section 8.3, Section 8.7, this Section 10.2,
Section 10.3 and Article XI and (ii) with respect to any liabilities for
damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the willful and
material breach by the other party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Effective Time as a consequence of a failure or non-waiver of any condition
contained in Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.3(c) or pursuant to Section
10.1(b)(iii), Section 10.1(d), Section 10.1(e) or Section 10.1(f), then the
Company shall pay Acquiror an amount equal to the Parent Expense
Reimbursement Amount. Payment of the Parent Expense Reimbursement Amount
pursuant to this Section 10.2(b) shall be made not later than five
(5) Business Days after Parent has delivered to the Company a notice of
demand for payment and a documented itemization setting forth in reasonable
detail all expenses for which it seeks payment (which itemization may be
supplemented and updated from time to time until the thirtieth (30th) day
after Parent delivers notice of demand for payment).

  

   

     
   

  



  

### (c) In addition to any payment required by Section 10.2(b) and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company and Parent
agree that:

  

### 

  

#### (i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(e)(i), (ii)
or (iii) or Section 10.1(f) then the Company shall immediately pay to Parent
the Termination Fee;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iii) or
Section 10.1(d) then, in the event that, prior to such termination, (A) any
Third Party Acquisition occurs or (B) any Third Party shall have publicly
made, proposed, communicated or disclosed an intention to make a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal (or such Acquisition Proposal becomes publicly known or
is otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company or the
Special Committee) that, in the event of a termination pursuant to Section
10.1(d), could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall immediately pay to Parent the Termination Fee;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.1(b)(iii) or Section 10.1(d) and (B) no Termination Fee has been paid by
the Company to Parent and (C) within twelve (12) months following such
termination, (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or (2) any Third Party Acquisition occurs, then
the Company shall immediately pay to Parent the Termination Fee upon the
first to occur of the events described in clause (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this
sentence; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) if (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i)
(provided that at the time of such termination pursuant to Section
10.1(b)(i), the conditions precedent in Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.3(d)
shall have been capable of being satisfied and the reason for the Closing not
having previously occurred shall not be the failure to satisfy the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 9.2 through no fault of the Company) and (B)
prior to such termination, (1) any Third Party Acquisition occurs or (2) any
Third Party shall have publicly made, proposed, communicated or disclosed an
intention to make a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, or such Acquisition
Proposal becomes publicly known or is otherwise communicated to the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Special Committee, and (C) no Termination Fee
has been paid by the Company to Parent and (D) within twelve (12) months
following such termination, (1) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (2) any Third Party
Acquisition occurs, then the Company shall immediately pay to Parent the
Termination Fee upon the first to occur of the events described in clause
(D)(1) and (D)(2) of this sentence.  Solely for the purposes of Sections
10.2(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv) and Section 10.1(e)(iv) hereof, all references to
15% in the definition of the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to
be 20%.

  

#### 

  

### (d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section
10.2(b) and Section 10.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without the agreement, they would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
promptly the Parent Expense Reimbursement Amount or the Termination Fee
payable by it pursuant to this Section 10.2, then the Company shall pay to
Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
collecting such amounts, together with interest on the amounts at the prime
rate in effect from time to time and quoted in _The Wall Street Journal_
during such period from the date such payment was due under this Agreement
until the date of payment.

  

   

     
   

  



  

## 10.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

## 11.2 _Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants or

## 

  

## 11.3 _Amendments_ _; No Waivers_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time, if, and only if, the amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Acquiror, or

### 

  

### (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company may
with respect to the other party (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of such other party and (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of such other

this Agreement not expressly identified in such extension or waiver on the
same or any other occasion. No failure or delay by any party in exercising

shall any single or partial exercise thereof

  

   

     
   

  



  

### preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any

shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Law.

  

### 

  

## 11.4 _Successor_ _s and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall

their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that all or any
of the rights or obligations of Acquiror may be assigned to any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror (which assignment shall not
relieve Acquiror of its obligations hereunder); provided, further, that other
than with respect to the foregoing proviso, no party may assign, delegate or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment in
violation hereof shall be null and void.

  

## 

  

## 11.5 _Counterpart_ _s; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto
were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when
each party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of
the other parties hereto.  Except as set forth in Sections 3.3, 3.4 or 7.1,
no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 11.6 _Governing_ _Law_.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to

State of Oregon.

  

## 

  

## 11.7 _Jurisdiction_.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, County of New Castle or, if such court does not have jurisdiction
over the subject matter of such proceeding or if such jurisdiction is not
available, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and
each of the parties hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any suit, action or proceeding in any of those courts or that any
suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any of those courts has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any suit, action or proceeding
may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any of the named courts.  Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on it by notice as
provided in Section 11.1 shall be deemed effective service of process.

  

## 

  

## 11.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the exhibits and
schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

## 

  

## 11.9 _Authorship_.  The parties agree that the terms and language of this
Agreement were the 

  

   

     
   

  



  

## result of negotiations between the parties and, as a result, there shall
be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved
against any party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall
be decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

  

## 

  

## 11.10 _Severability_.  If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

## 

  

## 11.11 _Waiver of_ _Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

## 

  

## 11.12 _Headings_ _; Construction_. The headings contained in this Agreement

the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and if the
last day of such period is not a Business Day, then the period shall end
on the next day which is a Business Day.
