STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of February 4,
2016, is made by and among Premier Farnell plc, a public limited company
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and the ultimate parent of
Celdis and PF Corp (the "Ultimate Parent"), Celdis Limited, a private limited
company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales ("Celdis"), Premier
Farnell Corp., a Delaware corporation ("PF Corp" and together with Celdis and
Ultimate Parent, each a "Seller" and collectively the "Sellers"), Akron Brass
Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and IDEX Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article XII below.

WHEREAS, PF Corp owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Company's Class A Cumulative Voting Preferred Stock (the "Company Preferred
Stock"), par value $0.01 per share;

WHEREAS, Celdis owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's
Class B Common Stock (the "Company Common Stock"), par value $0.01 per share
(the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock collectively, the
"Shares");

WHEREAS, the Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock constitute all
of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Company; and

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire, and PF Corp and Celdis desire to
sell to the Purchaser, all of the Shares on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Article I



PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

1.01 Purchase and Sale of Shares

.

(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, PF Corp shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from PF Corp, all of
the outstanding Company Preferred Stock, free and clear of all Liens, in
exchange for the payment of an amount equal to the Preferred Stock
Consideration in cash to PF Corp.

(b)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, Celdis shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from Celdis, all of
the outstanding Company Common Stock, free and clear of all Liens, in exchange
for the payment of an amount equal to the Closing Cash Consideration in cash
to Celdis.

(c)Payment for such Shares shall be made by wire transfer on the Closing Date
of immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by PF Corp and
Celdis to the Purchaser prior to the Closing.



1.02 Calculation of Consideration

. 

(d)For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Preferred Stock Consideration"
means an amount equal to the sum of (A) the product of (i) the number of
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Closing
multiplied by (ii) $93,200 per share of Company Preferred Stock, plus (B) the
aggregate of all accrued, undeclared, unpaid and outstanding dividends on all
shares of Company Preferred Stock.

(e)For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Closing Cash Consideration" means
(i) $224,200,000 (the "Base Consideration"), minus (ii) the Preferred Stock
Consideration, plus (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds $40,687,000 (the "Net Working Capital Target"), or
minus (iv) the amount, if any, by which Estimated Net Working Capital is less
than the Net Working Capital Target, plus (v) the amount of Estimated Cash,
minus (vi) the amount of the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of the Closing,
minus (vii) the Estimated Indebtedness.

(f)For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Final Cash Consideration" means
(i) the Base Consideration, minus (ii) the Preferred Stock Consideration plus
(iii) the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the Net
Working Capital Target, or minus (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Net
Working Capital is less than the Net Working Capital Target, plus (v) the
amount of Cash, minus (vi) the amount of the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of
the Closing, minus (vii) the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiary
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (other than Indebtedness of
the Company or its Subsidiary referenced in clause (vii) of the definition of
Indebtedness to the extent released as of the Closing).



1.03 Cash, Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Indebtedness

. Not less than three (3) business days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Ultimate Parent shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Purchaser its
good faith calculation of its estimate of (a) Cash (the "Estimated Cash"), (b)
Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") and (c) Indebtedness
of the Company and its Subsidiary outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing (other than Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiary referenced
in clause (vii) of the definition of Indebtedness to the extent released as of
the Closing) (the "Estimated Indebtedness"). In the event the Purchaser
disputes in good faith any amounts provided by the Ultimate Parent in respect
of the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Ultimate Parent and the Purchaser
shall work in good faith to resolve such disputes. If the Ultimate Parent and
the Purchaser are unable to resolve any such disputes within the two (2)
business days following the Ultimate Parent's delivery of the Estimated Net
Working Capital, and the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital
calculated by the Ultimate Parent and the Purchaser's good faith estimate of
Net Working Capital is equal to or less than $1,000,000, then the Estimated
Net Working Capital calculated by the Ultimate Parent shall be used to
determine the Closing Cash Consideration. If the Ultimate Parent and the
Purchaser are unable to resolve any such disputes within the two (2) business
days following the Ultimate Parent's delivery of the Estimated Net Working
Capital, and the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital
calculated by the Ultimate Parent and the Purchaser's good faith estimate of
Net Working Capital is greater than $1,000,000, then the Estimated Net Working
Capital used to determine the Closing Cash Consideration shall be set at an
amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000,000 plus the Purchaser's good faith
estimate of Net Working Capital and (ii) the midpoint between the Estimated
Net Working Capital calculated by the Ultimate Parent and the Purchaser's good
faith estimate of Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any such changes to the Estimated Net Working
Capital amount from the amounts initially provided by the Ultimate Parent
shall not limit, modify or affect in any respect the determination of the
actual Net Working Capital in accordance with Section 1.04.

1.04 Adjustment to Consideration

. 

(g)As promptly as possible, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Ultimate Parent a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiary (the "Closing
Balance Sheet") as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date and a statement showing the calculation of the Net Working
Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet, the actual Cash and the actual
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiary outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing (other than Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiary
referenced in clause (vii) of the definition of Indebtedness to the extent
released as of the Closing) (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the
"Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be prepared and the Net Working Capital, Cash and Indebtedness shall be
determined on a consolidated basis using the accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation methodology, as set forth on Section 1.04 of the
Disclosure Schedules and consistent with this Section 1.04 and the definitions
contained in this Agreement. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing
the Closing Balance Sheet and determining Net Working Capital, actual Cash and
actual Indebtedness and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by
this Section 1.04 is to measure changes in Net Working Capital, Cash and
Indebtedness consistent with this Section 1.04 and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet or determining Net Working Capital, Cash or Indebtedness consistent with
this Section 1.04, and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities
as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from
or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby. For
forty-five (45) days after the Purchaser's delivery of the Preliminary Net
Working Capital Statement, the Ultimate Parent and its accountants shall be
permitted access to review the Purchaser's work papers related to the
preparation of the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement; provided that
such access shall occur only during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice to the Purchaser. The Ultimate Parent's right of access under this
Section 1.04(a) shall terminate immediately upon the final determination of
Net Working Capital pursuant to this Section 1.04(a). The Ultimate Parent and
its accountants may make inquiries of the Purchaser and its accountants
regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the Preliminary Net
Working Capital Statement (including the Purchaser's statement of the actual
Cash and actual Indebtedness) arising in the course of their review thereof.
If the Ultimate Parent has any objections to the Preliminary Net Working
Capital Statement (including the Purchaser's statement of the actual Cash and
actual Indebtedness), it shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting
forth its objections thereto (an "Objections Statement"). If an Objections
Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after
delivery of the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement, the Preliminary Net
Working Capital Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the
parties hereto. The Purchaser and the Ultimate Parent shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Purchaser and the Ultimate Parent shall submit such dispute to
Duff and Phelps LLC (the "Dispute Resolution Auditor"). Any subsequent
submissions to the Dispute Resolution Auditor must be written and delivered to
the other party. The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall consider only those
items and amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement as being
items which the Purchaser and the Ultimate Parent are unable to resolve. The
Dispute Resolution Auditor's determination will be based solely on the
definition and method of calculation of Net Working Capital, Cash and
Indebtedness contained or referred to (as the case may be) herein. The
Purchaser and the Ultimate Parent shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor to resolve all disagreements
as soon as practicable. Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditor's 

determination shall be based solely on the presentations by the Ultimate
Parent and the Purchaser, which are in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution
Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The
costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be allocated
between the Ultimate Parent and the Purchaser based upon the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the Ultimate Parent
claims the Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
the Purchaser's accountants, and the Purchaser contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by the Ultimate Parent, and if the Dispute Resolution Auditor
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Ultimate Parent $300 of the
$500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated
60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the
Ultimate Parent.

(h)If the Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.04(a) above is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital as determined
pursuant to Section 1.03, the Purchaser shall pay such excess to Celdis. If
the Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.04(a)
above is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to
Section 1.03, Celdis shall (and the Ultimate Parent shall cause Celdis to)
deliver to the Purchaser such shortfall. Payments to be made pursuant to this
Section 1.04 shall be made in accordance with Section 1.05.

(i)If the actual Cash as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.04(a) above
is greater than the Estimated Cash as determined pursuant to Section 1.03, the
Purchaser shall pay such excess to Celdis. If the actual Cash as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.04(a) above is less than the Estimated Cash
as determined pursuant to Section 1.03, Celdis shall (and the Ultimate Parent
shall cause Celdis to) deliver to the Purchaser such shortfall. Payments to be
made pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be made in accordance with Section
1.05.

(j)If the actual Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiary outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Closing as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.04(a) above is less than the Estimated Indebtedness as determined pursuant
to Section 1.03, the Purchaser shall pay such difference to Celdis. If the
actual Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiary outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing as finally determined pursuant to Section
1.04(a) above is greater than the Estimated Indebtedness as determined
pursuant to Section 1.03, Celdis shall (and the Ultimate Parent shall cause
Celdis to) deliver to the Purchaser such difference. Payments to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be made in accordance with Section 1.05.

(24) hours and prior to providing any such Person with any non-public
information) notify the Purchaser in writing if any proposal, inquiries or
offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations

or non-binding letter of intent, option, joint venture, partnership or other
arrangement or understanding in connection with any Competing Proposal (other

and in accordance with the limitations set forth therein). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the board of directors of the Ultimate Parent may, prior to the
Ultimate Parent Approval, in response to a Superior Proposal received after
the date of this Agreement and in the absence of any violation of this Section
7.05, make a Change in Recommendation or cause the Ultimate Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(i) and concurrently with
such termination enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, subject to satisfaction of its obligations under Section
10.03; provided, however, that:

effect a Change in Recommendation or exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(i) until five (5) full business days

directors of the Ultimate Parent intend to take such action, including a
description of the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal and
a copy of the proposed transaction agreement for any such Superior Proposal in
the form to be entered into (it being understood and agreed that, in the event
of an amendment to the financial terms or other material economic terms of
such Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the Ultimate Parent shall
not be entitled to exercise such right based on such Superior Proposal, as so
amended, until five (5) full business days following delivery of written
notice to the Purchaser of a Section 7.05(f) Notice with respect to such
Superior Proposal as so amended). In determining whether to terminate this
Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal or to make a Change in
Recommendation, the board of directors of the Ultimate Parent shall take into
account any proposals made by the Purchaser to amend the terms of this
Agreement, and the Ultimate Parent shall, and shall cause the Ultimate
Parent's financial advisor and legal counsel to negotiate in good faith with
the Purchaser regarding any such proposals and shall not make a Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement unless, prior to the effectiveness
of such Change in Recommendation or termination, the board of directors of the
Ultimate Parent, after considering the results of any such negotiations and
any revised proposals made by the Purchaser, concludes in good faith (after
consultation with the Ultimate Parent's outside counsel and financial
advisors) that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Section 7.05(f) Notice
continues to be a Superior Proposal.

event on or before March 7, 2016, subject to any required approval of the
UKLA, the Ultimate Parent shall prepare and deliver a Class 1 circular (which

Listing Rules and any other applicable Law, that has been approved by the FCA
(the "Class 1 Circular") to the Ultimate Parent Shareholders (the "Circular
Distribution"). The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its authorized
representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and
promptly provide in good faith any information to the Ultimate Parent
reasonably required for the preparation of the Class 1 Circular and all other
documentation necessary in connection with the

filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the UKLA or its
staff with respect to the Class 1 Circular will be made by the Ultimate
Parent, without providing the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and the Ultimate Parent shall give reasonable consideration
to all reasonable comments promptly suggested by the Purchaser or its
counsel).

(h)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Circular Distribution, and,
in any event, no later than twenty (20) days after the delivery of such Class
1 Circular, the Ultimate Parent shall duly convene the Ultimate Parent GM for
purposes of considering and passing an ordinary resolution of the shareholders
(the "Ultimate Parent Class 1 Resolution") of Ultimate Parent to approve,
implement and effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Sellers' sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance of the Shares
to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the "Ultimate
Parent Approval").



7.07 Non-Solicitation of Employees; Non-Competition

.

(a)For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, as to any Company Employee who either (1)
was retained, (2) became employed or (3) was offered employment by the
Purchaser or a Subsidiary of the Purchaser (including the Company and its
Subsidiary) (a "Covered Person"), the Sellers agree that no Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller will solicit for employment any Covered Person;
provided that each Seller and its Affiliates shall not be precluded from
soliciting, hiring or taking any other action with respect to any such
individual (i) whose employment with the Purchaser or a Subsidiary of the
Purchaser (including the Company and its Subsidiary) has been terminated by
the Purchaser or such Subsidiary for at least six (6) months prior to
commencement of employment discussions between such Seller or its Affiliates
and such individual, and (ii) who responds to any solicitation not
specifically targeted at employees of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiary) (including by a search firm or
recruiting agency); and provided, further, that each Seller and its Affiliates
shall not be restricted from engaging in solicitations or advertising not
specifically targeted at any Covered Persons described above.

(b)Each Seller agrees and acknowledges that in order to assure the Purchaser
that the Business, the Company and its Subsidiary will retain their value as a
going concern, it is necessary that such party undertake to not utilize its
special confidential knowledge of the Business, the Company and its Subsidiary
and their respective relationships with clients or customers to compete with
the Purchaser. Each Seller further agrees and acknowledges that the Business
could be irreparably damaged if such party were to engage in a business
substantially similar to, or competitive with the Business (a "Competing
Business") for the Restricted Period. Therefore, as a significant inducement
to the Purchaser to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement, each Seller agrees that for a period of five (5) years from the
Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, it will not, and will cause each of its successors, assigns and
Affiliates to not, anywhere in the world, directly or indirectly, either for
itself or any other Person, engage in, own, operate, manage, control, invest
in or participate in any manner or permit its name to be used by, act as a
consultant or advisor to, render services for (alone or in association with
any Person), or otherwise assist in any manner any Person that engages in or
owns, operates, manages, controls, invests in or participates in, any
Competing Business; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude any
Seller from (i) owning five percent (5%) or less of the outstanding securities
of any Person or (ii) acquiring any Person, whether through a business
combination, acquisition or otherwise, (x) whose gross revenues (including
revenues of Affiliates of such Person only to the extent acquired) generated
from the Competitive Business does not exceed ten percent 

(10%) of the total gross revenues of such Person (including revenues of
Affiliates of such Person to the extent acquired) during the twelve (12)-month
period immediately preceding the acquisition or (y) if the Competitive
Business operated or owned by such Person does not exceed thirty percent (30%)
of the total gross revenues of such Person (including revenues of Affiliates
of such Person only to the extent acquired) and is sold or otherwise disposed
of by such Seller during the twelve (12)-month period immediately following
such acquisition.

(c)Each Seller recognizes that the territorial, time and scope limitations set
forth in this Section 7.07 are reasonable and are properly required for the
protection of the Company's and the Purchaser's legitimate interests in client
relationships, goodwill and trade secrets, and in the event that any such
territorial, time or scope limitation is deemed to be unreasonable or by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the Purchaser and each Seller agree to submit
to the reduction of any or all of said territorial, time or scope limitations
to such area, period or scope as said court shall deem reasonable or
enforceable under the circumstances, and in its reduced form, such provision
shall then be enforceable.



7.08 Intercompany Arrangements

(a). Except as set forth in Section 7.08 of the Disclosure Schedules,
effective upon the Closing, all intercompany accounts among any Seller or its
Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiary), on the one hand, and

terminated and discharged. In the event that any of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates is unable to settle all such intercompany accounts prior to
the Closing, the parties shall cooperate in good faith from and after the
Closing to equitably settle such accounts. The Sellers shall be entitled to
terminate, effective upon the Closing, any intercompany Contracts (or portions
thereof) or other arrangements (whether written or oral) relating to the
Business, the Company and its Subsidiary between any of the Sellers and any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or its Subsidiary, on the
other hand, and from and after the Closing, no further rights or obligations
of any party shall continue under such terminated Contracts (or portions
thereof) or arrangements.



7.09 Confidentiality

(a). During the Restricted Period, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives and Affiliates to, keep all non-public information,
including documents, materials and records that they have or have obtained
prior to the Closing regarding the Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiary or
the Business ("Confidential Information") confidential and will not disclose
such information without the Purchaser's prior written consent; provided,
however, that the Sellers shall not be liable hereunder with respect to any
disclosure of any such information to the extent such disclosure is determined
by such Seller (with the advice of counsel) to be required under any
applicable Law or order, including applicable rules of any securities exchange
so long as, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, (i) promptly
notify the Purchaser in writing of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such requirement, (ii) cooperate with the Purchaser, at the
Purchaser's expense, to take legally available steps to resist or narrow such
requirement and obtain an appropriate protective order or other remedy and
(iii) if disclosure of such information is required, notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, such Seller shall be permitted to disclose only any such

accorded to such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential

Seller or its Representatives or Affiliates in violation of this Section
7.09), (ii) is or becomes available to any Seller or its respective
Representatives or Affiliates from a source that is not known by such Seller
or such Representatives or Affiliates to be bound by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Purchaser or any if its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiary) or (iii) has been 

independently developed by any Seller or its respective Representatives or
Affiliates (other than by the Company or any of its Subsidiary) without
reference to Confidential Information.



7.10 Intellectual Property

(a). The Sellers will, at their own cost and expense, use commercially
reasonable efforts to file, prior to the Closing Date, all such documents with
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or similar offices in other
jurisdictions) as are necessary to record the Subsidiary as the owner of all
patents and patent applications set forth in Section 4.10 of the Disclosure
Schedules to the extent not already recorded as owned by the Company or its
Subsidiary, and provide Purchaser with copies of such filings and filing
receipts issued in connection therewith.



7.11 Assignment of Agreements

Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to, identify any
Canadian distributor contracts to which any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiary) is the contracting party
and which are exclusively used in the Business. Promptly after identifying any
such distributor contracts, the Ultimate Parent will provide copies thereof to
the Purchaser. No such distributor contracts shall be transferred or assigned
to the Purchaser or any Subsidiary designated by the Purchaser without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

7.12 Release

. Effective upon the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, and each of their respective successors and assigns (each, a
"Releasor"), and in its capacity as a direct or indirect shareholder of the
Company or its Subsidiary, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company, its Subsidiary and their
respective current officers, directors, stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates and employees (each, a "Releasee") of, from and against any and all
actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues
and suits of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, which such
Releasor ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever arising prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
this release does not extend to any claim to enforce the terms of, and such
Seller's rights under, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

7.13 Certain IP Assignment Matters

. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers will, at their own cost and expense,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each third party identified in

acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), with
the Company's Subsidiary pursuant to which such third party assigns to the
Company's Subsidiary all right, title and interest in and to all Intellectual
Property developed by such third party on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiary.



Article VIII



COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER



8.01 Access to Books and Records

. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, provide each Seller and its Representatives during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice, and in accordance with the Purchaser's procedures
relating to books and records then in place, reasonable access to the books
and 

records of the Company and its Subsidiary with respect to periods or
occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date to the extent that such access may
be reasonably requested by Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to disclose any
information to any Seller if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to:
(x) jeopardize any attorney client or other legal privilege (provided that the
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow such access
or disclosure without jeopardizing such privilege) or (y) contravene any
applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement with a third party
(provided that the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure).
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Ultimate Parent, the Purchaser
shall not, and shall not permit the Company or its Subsidiary, until the
expiration of the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date to destroy,
alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Company or
its Subsidiary for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior notice to the Ultimate Parent and offering to surrender to
the Ultimate Parent such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8.01, while the existence of an
adversarial proceeding between the parties will not abrogate or suspend the
provisions of this Section 8.01, as to such records or other information
directly pertinent to such dispute, the parties may not utilize this Section
8.01 but rather, absent agreement, must utilize the rules of discovery.

8.02 Notification

. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Purchaser may disclose to
the Ultimate Parent in writing any material variances from the representations
and warranties contained in Article VI. No such disclosure shall be deemed to
amend and supplement the Disclosure Schedules delivered on the date hereof or
have any impact on any rights or remedies of Sellers set forth in this
Agreement.

8.03 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification

.

(a)For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not
permit the Company or its Subsidiary to amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provision in the Company's or its Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent governing document) relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any officers and/or directors (unless required by Law), it
being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of the Company
and its Subsidiary (the "DandO Indemnitees") shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent of the Law.

(b)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain commercially reasonable,
prepaid "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from
the Closing Date which have terms and conditions providing directors' and
officers' liability insurance benefits that are consistent with the Company's
existing policies which cover acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the Company shall consult with Purchaser
in good faith prior to obtaining such "tail" insurance policies. The Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary not to, cancel or
change such insurance policies in any material respect.

(c)In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are
sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, then the
Purchaser and the Company shall, and in each such case, ensure that the
successors and assigns of the Company assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 8.03.



8.04 Employee Matters

. 

(d)During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide or cause to
be provided to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiary who remains an
employee of the Company or its Subsidiary (collectively, the "Company
Employees") the same base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and, subject to
subsections (b) through (i) below, other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding equity-based incentive compensation) that are substantially similar
in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided to such
employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to each Company
Employee who is covered by the collective bargaining agreements set forth on
Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedules the compensation and employee
benefits as of and for the time periods required by the terms of such
collective bargaining agreements.

(e)As of the Closing Date, (i) all Company Employees shall, subject to
subsection (c) below, cease active participation in all Plans sponsored by PF
Corp or its Affiliates that are not Company Plans or Transferred Company
Plans, and (ii) shall begin participation in employee benefit plans and
programs that the Purchaser maintains, establishes or causes the Company to
maintain or establish on or after the Closing Date for Company Employees ("New
Plans"). With respect to the New Plans, the Purchaser agrees to grant Company
Employees, or cause to be granted to such employees, credit for any service
with the Company or its Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date (x) for
eligibility and vesting purposes and (y) for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance benefit determinations under any New Plan. In addition, the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance
and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before the Closing Date by any
Company Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, co-insurance and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan
in the year of initial participation. The Purchaser and the Sellers
acknowledge and agree that none of the transactions contemplated hereby will
trigger a payment or distribution of compensation under the Premier Farnell
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (as amended and restated, and as
subsequently amended) (the "PF Corp NQDC Plan") for any Company Employee and,
consequently, that the payment or distribution of any compensation to which
any Company Employee is entitled under the PF Corp NQDC Plan will occur upon
such individual's "separation from service" from the Company or its Subsidiary
from and after the Closing Date, or at such other time as specified in the PF
Corp NQDC Plan. With respect to any Company Employee who is a participant in
the PF Corp NQDC Plan, the Purchaser and/or the Company, as applicable, shall
notify the Sellers in writing of any such Company Employee who incurs a
"separation from service" within five (5) business days following such
separation.

(f)Each Company Employee who, prior to the Closing Date, became disabled as
defined in the Plans that provide short and long-term disability benefits (a
"Disabled Company Employee") and, as of the Closing Date, is receiving or is
entitled to receive long-term disability benefits under a Plan sponsored by PF
Corp or its Affiliates that is not a Company Plan shall continue to receive or
be entitled to receive such long-term disability benefits under such Plan in
accordance with its terms and conditions. On and after the Closing Date, (i)
the Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided short-term disability
benefits under a New Plan to each Disabled Company Employee who, as of the
Closing Date, is receiving or is eligible to receive short-term disability
benefits under a Plan, and (ii) the Sellers and its Plans shall have no
Liability or obligation with respect to such short-term disability benefits,
but shall provide long-term disability benefits to such Disabled Company
Employee in accordance with the preceding sentence if such Disabled Company
Employee becomes entitled to long-term disability benefits. 

(g)On and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall or shall cause the Company
promptly to reimburse the Sellers for any claim not covered by insurance
incurred by or on behalf of a Company Employee (and their eligible dependents
or beneficiaries), notice of which is received after the Closing Date for a
claim related to a pre-Closing incurrence, under any Plan providing health
benefits (including medical, dental, prescription drug, and vision benefits)
sponsored by PF Corp or its Affiliates that is not a Company Plan. For
purposes of this Section 8.04(d), a claim for such health benefits shall be
deemed to be incurred upon the provision of the treatment, service, material
or supply giving rise to the claim.

(h)The Purchaser shall provide the Company Employees and their "qualified
beneficiaries" (as defined in Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code) with
continuation coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code as a result
of any "qualifying events" (as defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code)
that occur after the Closing.

(i)The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, the Company and its Subsidiary shall assume or retain, as applicable,
all obligations and responsibilities (including any and all reporting,
disclosure and administrative obligations or responsibilities) and Liabilities
arising under or relating to (i) the collective bargaining agreements set
forth on Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedules, (ii) the Plans set forth on
Section 8.04(f)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules, (the "Transferred Company
Plans"), (iii) any benefit plan or arrangement established by the Purchaser,
the Company or its Subsidiary to comply with the requirements of the
collective bargaining agreements set forth on Section 4.16 of the Disclosure
Schedules (or any successor thereto) and (iv) any obligations to provide
Company Employees retiree health care benefits upon their retirement from the
Company or its Subsidiary on and after the Closing Date, and that from and
after the Closing Date, under clauses (i) through (iii), none of the Sellers,
any of their Affiliates, or any employee, officer or director of any of them
shall have any obligation, responsibility or Liability with respect thereto
and under clause (iv) none of the Sellers, any of their Affiliates, or any
employee, officer or director of any of them shall have any obligation,
responsibility or Liability with respect to Company Employees. From and after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties
from and against (1) any Losses or obligations that may be incurred at any
time with respect to clauses (i) through (iii) and (2) any Losses or
obligations that may be incurred at any time with respect to clause (iv) as
relates to Company Employees. Provided that the Purchaser does not take or
agree to take, or cause the Company or its Subsidiary to take or agree to
take, any action after the Closing Date that increases the health benefits
provided to Company Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
which could result in an increase in the health benefits provided to retirees
under the terms of the collective bargaining agreements, the Sellers agree to,
or to cause a health care plan sponsored and maintained by the Sellers to: (y)
retain all obligations, responsibilities and Liabilities to provide retiree
health benefits to those eligible retirees of the Company or its Subsidiary
who retired from the Company or its Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date and
are entitled to such retiree health benefits under the terms of the collective
bargaining agreements set forth on Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedules
(or any predecessor thereof) as of the Closing Date, subject to any right of
the Sellers to amend or terminate such plan and (z) indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses or obligations that may be
incurred at any time with respect to such retiree health benefits. In the
event any severance, separation or similar payment or benefit is or becomes
due or payable to any of the individuals identified on Section 8.04(f)(ii) of
the Disclosure Schedules prior to, on or after the Closing as a result of or
in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event, except for terminations by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any such individuals after the Closing)
("Foreign Severance Obligations"), whether due or payable by any of the
Sellers, the Company or its Subsidiary, the Sellers acknowledge and agree that
(i) all Foreign Severance Obligations shall be paid by Sellers and neither the
Company nor its Subsidiary shall have any Liability therefor and (ii) Sellers
shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses
or obligations that may be incurred at any time with respect to any Foreign
Severance Obligations. The Purchaser and the Sellers (1) agree to fully
cooperate with each other, 

as and when required, (A) to ensure that these covenants are satisfied from
and after the Closing Date and (B) to enter into agreements and take any other
actions that are necessary to effect the transfer of the individuals
identified on Section 8.04(f)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules to one or more
of the Purchaser's Affiliates, as requested in writing by the Purchaser from
time to time during the period commencing with the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the thirtieth (30th) day following the Closing Date, which
transfers shall be effected as promptly as possible following the earlier of
the Closing Date or the date on which Purchaser makes such written request and
(2) agree to take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Foreign
Severance Obligations to any such individuals that may become due or payable
by any of the Sellers, the Company or its Subsidiary as a result of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that
such reasonable steps shall not include any payment, assumption of liability
or adverse tax consequence by or to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for
the Foreign Severance Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible and shall pay or promptly
reimburse the Sellers for all costs and expenses (including salaries, wages,
benefits and Taxes, but not including the Foreign Severance Obligations)
related to the employment of the individuals identified on Section 8.04(f)(ii)
of the Disclosure Schedules during the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the date the employment of such employee is transferred to the
Purchaser's Affiliates as described in clause (1)(B) of the preceding
sentence.

(j)As of the Closing Date, Company Employees shall become members of a class
of employees eligible to participate in a New Plan that is a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code ("Purchaser 401(k)
Plan"). The Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Purchaser
401(k) Plan to accept eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section
402(c)(4) of the Code), including a rollover of any associated plan loans.

(k)The Purchaser will indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties from and
against any Losses that may be incurred by them under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act or under any state, local or foreign Law with
respect to any plant or office closing, layoff or relocation occurring after
the Closing as a result of any action taken by the Purchaser or the Company
following the Closing, or with respect to any obligation to provide notice,
payment or any other benefit as a result of or arising out of any termination
of employment of any employee of the Company following the Closing. Prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide a list of all terminations of
employment affecting any employees of the Company within ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall update this list up to and including
the Closing Date.

(l)The provisions of this Section 8.04 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 8.04 shall
create such rights in any such Persons, including the right to: (i) guaranteed
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the Purchaser to
terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time and for any
reason, or (ii) require the Purchaser or the Company to continue any Company
Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Closing. Nothing in
this Section 8.04 or otherwise in this Agreement shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Plan or any other employee benefit
plans of the Company, its Subsidiary or the Purchaser.



8.05 Conditions

. The Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 3.02 to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article III (other than those to
be satisfied at the Closing). 

8.06 Contact with Customers and Suppliers

. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser (and the Purchaser's Representatives, as
applicable) shall contact and communicate with the employees, customers and
suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby only after prior consultation with and
written approval of Joseph R. Daprile (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the foregoing shall not
prohibit the Purchaser from contacting its customers and suppliers in the
ordinary course of business who are also customers or suppliers of the Company
or its Subsidiary; provided that, no such contact or communication with the
Purchaser's customers and suppliers may disclose or refer to in any way this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Promptly after the
date of this Agreement, the Ultimate Parent and the Purchaser will confer and
reasonably cooperate to form a joint strategy in order for the Purchaser to
contact and communicate with the employees, customers and suppliers of the
Company and its Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

8.07 Seller Marks

. Except as specifically set forth herein, following the Closing Date, none of
the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiary shall use the names, marks, trade
names, trademarks, service marks or domain names, or telephone or other
contact information of any of the Sellers (collectively, the "Seller Marks"),
including those incorporating "Premier Farnell"; provided, however, the
Sellers hereby grant to the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiary a
limited, fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferrable, worldwide, non-
exclusive license to use the Seller Marks, to use and distribute existing
tangible printed materials bearing the Seller Marks on hand as of the Closing
Date, and to use the Seller Marks on existing signage, marketing materials and
other materials, which license and/or rights to use any such Seller Marks,
materials, or signage shall expire upon the earlier of (a) six (6) months
after the Closing Date and (b) the depletion of such materials or, in the case
of signage, the removal of the Seller Marks from such signage. Nothing herein
shall require the Purchaser to modify any products or materials of the
Business that have been distributed to customers or other third parties to
remove the Seller Marks, to modify any existing Books and Records of the
Business or to refrain from stating factually (other than on the Company's or
its Subsidiary's products) that the Business was previously owned by the
Sellers (or other "fair uses" of Seller Marks). The Purchaser, the Company and
its Subsidiary shall comply with all quality control requirements and
guidelines in effect for the Seller Marks as of the Closing Date, but in any
event shall maintain quality and service standards at least equal to those
maintained by the Sellers prior to the Closing Date; provided that the Sellers
shall have a right to revoke and terminate the license granted in this Section
8.07 upon reasonable advance notice and with a reasonable right to cure if the
Company, its Subsidiary or the Purchaser fail to maintain such standards in
any material respect. Any goodwill arising from the use of the Seller Marks by
the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiary shall inure to the benefit of the
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Company or the
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be in breach of this Section 8.07 with respect
to use of the Seller Marks on any exterior signage if the consent of any third
party is required to remove or change such signage, such consent has been
requested in writing within one (1) month following the Closing Date and
Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiary use commercially reasonable efforts
to remove the Seller Marks from such signage within six (6) months following
the Closing Date.

.

(m)From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article
IX), the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Purchaser and any
of its Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnified
Parties"), and hold them harmless against any Losses which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties actually sustain, as a result of: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Sellers or the Company contained in Article
IV or Article V of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder
(excluding any breach of representation or warranty relating to Taxes), (ii)
any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant to be performed by the Sellers or
the Company under this Agreement (excluding any nonfulfillment or breach of

asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise
be payable in the case of clause (i) (other than Losses resulting from

amount equal to one percent (1%) of the Base Consideration (the "Deductible"),
and then only in the amount by which such Losses exceed the Deductible;
provided further that no individual claim by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall be asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would
be payable pursuant to such claim (together with all related claims arising
out of the same set of facts) exceeds an amount equal to $25,000 (the "Mini-
Basket") (it being understood that any such claims 

for amounts less than the Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in determining
whether the Deductible has been exceeded).

(n)The aggregate Liability of the Sellers (i) pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i)
(other than Losses resulting from breaches of a Fundamental Representation)
shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount equal to one percent (1%) of the
Base Consideration (the "General Cap") and (ii) pursuant to Section
9.02(a)(iv) shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000
(the "Special Indemnification Cap") and, in each case, the Purchaser

to Section 9.02(a)(i) or Section 9.02(a)(iv), as applicable, after such time
as the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have received an aggregate amount equal
to the General Cap or the Special Indemnification Cap, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the aggregate
Liability of the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.02(a) shall in no event exceed

(o)The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that, from and after the Closing, the
sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto for any Losses based upon,
arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules, exhibits attached hereto and

hereby are the indemnification obligations of the parties as set forth in this
Article IX. The Purchaser expressly waives any and all rights and remedies
against the Sellers under any Law, including the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other Environmental Law.
The provisions of this Section 9.02(c) will not, however, prevent or limit a
cause of action (i) under Section 13.17 to obtain an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, (ii) under Section 1.04 to enforce any decision or
determination of the Dispute Resolution Auditor, (iii) related to any breach

. From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article
IX), the Purchaser shall indemnify each Seller and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") and
hold them harmless against any Losses which the Seller Indemnified Parties may
suffer or sustain, as a result of: (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Purchaser under this Agreement and (b) any nonfulfillment or
breach of any covenant to be performed by the Purchaser under this Agreement.

9.04 Additional Provisions

.

(a)Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all steps
required by Law to mitigate any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith. In the event that an Indemnitor makes any
payment to any Indemnitee for indemnification for which such Indemnitee could
have collected on a claim against a third party under any contract or any
third party insurance, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the rights that
such Indemnitee, to the extent of such payment, may have against such third
party with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification
claim. The Indemnitee shall, and 

shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company if the Company is an
Affiliate) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Indemnitor, at the Indemnitor's expense, with respect to any such effort to
pursue and collect with respect to any claim that Indemnitor has been granted
such subrogation rights.

(b)The Purchaser acknowledges that except as indicated on Schedule 4.17, (i)
all of the insurance policies applicable to the Company or its Subsidiary are
held by a Seller or an Affiliate thereof (other than the Company and its
Subsidiary), (ii) that no such policies shall be transferred to the Company,
its Subsidiary or to the Purchaser, and (iii) that following the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiary shall cease to be covered under such policies and
the Purchaser will have to obtain replacement coverage. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, solely with respect to
"occurrence-based" insurance policies (excluding health and welfare and other
similar insurance policies) applicable to the Company or its Subsidiary and
held by a Seller or an Affiliate thereof (other than the Company) (the
"Retained Occurrence Policies"), the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Purchaser in pursuing claims for any loss, liability or
damage under such Retained Occurrence Policies which are not transferred to
the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiary at Closing, solely arising out of
insured incidents occurring during the coverage period of such Retained
Occurrence Policies prior to the Closing Date to the extent that the terms and
conditions of such Retained Occurrence Policies so allow; provided that (A)
all of the Sellers' and their respective Affiliates' costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the foregoing (including the payment of any
required deductibles, increases in premiums and legal fees in connection with
any such matter) shall be the sole obligation of the Purchaser and such costs
and expenses shall be promptly paid by the Purchaser, (B) the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates may, at any time, amend, replace, terminate,
buyout, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any such Retained
Occurrence Policies without liability to the Purchaser or any other Person and
(C) any such claim will be subject to all terms and conditions of such
Retained Occurrence Policies.

(c)The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on the Purchaser's remedies with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically
taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to the
Sellers hereunder.



9.05 Defense of Third Party Claims

. Any Person making a claim for indemnification under Section 9.02 or Section
9.03 (an "Indemnitee") shall notify the indemnifying party (an "Indemnitor")
of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by a third
party) or becoming aware of the facts giving rise to such claim, describing
the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable, or if not known and
quantifiable, a good faith and reasonable estimate thereof) and the basis
thereof. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to
an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by giving notice to
the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of the notice of such claim by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnitor and, within such thirty (30) days period,
appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be
the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that any Indemnitor
shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained
herein; provided further that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose and to participate in the defense as counsel of record, if applicable,
in such action or proceeding (and the parties shall jointly control the
defense), and the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of such separate counsel if (i) there exists any actual or potential
(in the reasonable opinion of counsel) conflict of interest between the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor in connection with the defense of the third
party claim that would make representation by the same counsel 

or the counsel selected by the Indemnitor inappropriate, (ii) such third party
claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee or
(iii) such third party claim is related to or otherwise arises in connection
with any criminal or regulatory enforcement action. If the Indemnitor does not
assume the defense and control of any third party claim pursuant to this
Section 9.05, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense but the Indemnitor may nonetheless participate in the defense of such
third party claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of any such third party claim then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; provided that, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a third party claim if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement, (A) injunctive or other equitable or non-monetary
relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee, (B) any assets of the
Indemnitee will be encumbered, (C) the Indemnitee is not expressly and
unconditionally released from all Liabilities with respect to such third party
claim, (D) there is a finding or admission of any violation of Law or
admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnitee or (E) the damages payable under
the settlement are limited only to monetary payments for which the Indemnitee
is fully indemnified by the Indemnitor. No Indemnitee shall settle, compromise
or discharge, any claim hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 11.01(g), and not this
Section, shall apply to any Tax Contest.

9.06 Determination of Loss Amount

.

(d)The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 9.02 or
Section 9.03 shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit realized by the
Indemnitee on account of such Loss and (ii) any amounts recovered (net of any
costs incurred to recover such proceeds) by any Indemnitee or any of such
Indemnitee's Affiliates under or pursuant to any insurance policy, title
insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or contract pursuant to
which or under which such Indemnitee or such Indemnitee's Affiliates is a
party or has rights (collectively, "Alternative Arrangements"). For purposes
hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean (x) any refund of Taxes paid (including a
credit in lieu of a Tax refund) received in (or prior to) the taxable year of
the Loss or any of the three (3) taxable years immediately following the
taxable year of the Loss or (y) the amount by which the Indemnitee's Liability
for Taxes for all taxable years prior to and including the tax year of the
Loss, calculated by excluding the relevant amount of credit, deduction or
Loss, would exceed the Indemnitee's actual Liability for Taxes for such
period, calculated by taking into account the relevant amount of credit,
deduction, or Loss, in each case computed at the actual Tax rates applicable
to the recipient of such benefit. The Indemnitee shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all Alternative Arrangements
covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that a recovery is made
under an Alternative Arrangement by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss
for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal
to the recovery to the extent of the indemnification payment made shall be
made promptly to the Indemnitor.

(e)In no event shall any party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any
amounts in respect of, and "Losses" shall not include, punitive damages except
to the extent awarded against an Indemnitee in connection with a third party
claim.

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have no right to indemnification hereunder with respect to any
Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such matter was taken into account as a
liability or reserve on the Closing Balance Sheet (as finally 

determined pursuant to Section 1.04) or otherwise included in the calculation
of the Final Cash Consideration.

(g)In no event shall the Purchaser be entitled to recover for any Losses that
(i) are attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date, (ii) are due to the unavailability in any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating losses,
credits or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) that result from the breach
of the covenant in Section 11.01(e).

(h)In no event shall the Purchaser be entitled to recover for any Losses with
respect to any environmental investigation, monitoring, clean-up, containment,
restoration, removal or other corrective or response action (collectively,
"Response Actions") unless the Purchaser is required by Environmental Laws to
undertake such Response Action assuming the continued industrial use of the
relevant property or facility, employing where available risk-based remedial
standards and institutional controls, provided that such standards or controls
would not materially interfere with ongoing industrial operations at the
relevant property or facility. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Purchaser be entitled to recover for any
Losses with respect to any Response Action resulting or arising from any
conditions of contamination identified through any environmental invasive
sampling or disclosure to any Governmental Entity, except as relates to
sampling or disclosure that is (a) required by Law; (b) necessary to respond
to a material threat to human health or the environment; or (c) conducted when
a routine maintenance or operational project performed in the ordinary course
of business indicates evidence of a Release of Hazardous Materials that is not
permitted by Environmental Law or Environmental Permits.

(i)Any "Material Adverse Effect" or materiality qualifications in the
representations and warranties made in connection with this Agreement shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty and for purposes of calculating the amount of
Losses, in each case, under this Article IX, other than the representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.05(b), Section 4.06(a), Section 4.18,
Section 4.19 and Section 4.23.

Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of

with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts.

hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. 

Article XI



ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

11.01 Tax Matters

.

(x)Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(i)Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. The Sellers, at the sole cost and expense
of the Company, shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Income Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiary for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, the due date (including extensions of time to file) of which is
after the Closing Date (the "Seller Returns"). All such Seller Returns shall
be timely prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the
Company and its Subsidiary, as applicable, unless otherwise required by a
change in applicable Law. Except with respect to any Seller Return with
respect to an Affiliated Group which includes any of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates (other than any Seller Return for an Affiliated Group
comprised solely of the Company and its Subsidiary), the Sellers shall submit
each of the Seller Returns to the Purchaser at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Seller Returns (taking into account any
extensions) and the Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment on
such Seller Returns, and the Sellers shall reflect such comments from the
Purchaser on such Seller Returns to the extent such comments are consistent
with the standard set forth in the previous sentence.

(ii)Other Tax Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed any (A) Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiary for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date ("Straddle Period") and (B) any non-Income Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiary for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, in each case, the due date (including extensions of time to
file) of which is after the Closing Date (the "Purchaser Returns"). All such
Purchaser Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with the
past practice of the Company and its Subsidiary, as applicable, unless
otherwise required by a change in applicable Law. The Purchaser shall submit
each such Purchaser Returns to the Sellers at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Purchaser Returns (taking into account any
extensions) and the Sellers shall have the right to review and comment on such
Purchaser Returns, and the Purchaser shall reflect such comments from the
Sellers on such Purchaser Returns to the extent such comments are consistent

(iii)For the portion of the day of the Closing after the time of Closing,
other than the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiary to carry on its business only in the
ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore conducted. The Purchaser, the
Company and the Subsidiary shall not take any action, or permit any action to
be taken, that may prevent the Tax year of the Company and its Subsidiary from
ending for all relevant Tax purposes at the end of the day on which the
Closing occurs and shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect
with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiary. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to join the "consolidated
group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(h)) of which the
Purchaser is a member effective on the day after the Closing Date. The parties
agree that the Purchaser and its Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiary
shall not make (A) an election under Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate items (or any make any similar
election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding provision of state,
local or foreign law) or (B) apply the 

"next-day" rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with
respect to any of the Transaction Tax Deductions.

(iv)With respect to the preparation of Tax Returns hereunder, the Purchaser
and the Sellers agree that all Transaction Tax Deductions that are "more
likely than not" deductible in the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be treated as
properly allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. The parties agree to make
the safe harbor election set forth in Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2011-29 to determine the amount of permitted deductions for any
success based fees with respect to any Tax Returns filed hereunder. The
Purchaser shall (a) claim all such deductions on such Tax Returns, and (b)
request a refund (rather than a credit against future Taxes) with respect to
any overpayment for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(v)The Purchaser, the Sellers, and the Company consent and agree that the
Company and its Subsidiary, as appropriate, shall elect to carryback any item
of loss, deduction, or credit, including any Transaction Tax Deductions, for
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date to prior taxable years to the
fullest extent permitted by Law (using any available short-form or accelerated
procedures and filing amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary) to obtain
any potential Tax refunds or claims related thereto. The Seller, with respect
to any carryback related to a Seller Return, and the Purchaser, with respect
to any carryback related to a Purchaser Return, shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, any claim for refund resulting from such
carryback as part of the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns described
in Section 11.01(a)(i) and (ii) (and the Sellers or the Purchaser, as
applicable, shall have the review and approval rights described in the last
sentence of Section 11.01(a)(i) and (ii)).

(vi)Tax Refunds. The Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (or
overpayment of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that generates a
credit in lieu of a refund and is applied to reduce Taxes in a tax period
beginning after the Closing Date and ending no later than three years after
the Closing Date (an "Overpayment Credit")) that are received by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, the Company or its Subsidiary attributable to Taxes
paid by any Seller, the Company or its Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including any Tax refunds attributable to the carryback of
items under Section 11.01(a)(v) above) to the extent attributable to (A) Taxes
paid by or on behalf of any Seller, the Company or the Subsidiary prior to the
Closing Date, (B) Taxes included as a liability in Net Working Capital (as
finally determined hereunder) or (C) Taxes paid by any of the Sellers pursuant
to Section 9.02(a)(iii), but excluding the carryback of any items arising in a
period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Taxes that are included as
assets in Net Working Capital (as finally determined hereunder)). The
Purchaser shall pay over to the Sellers any such Tax refund (or Overpayment
Credit) within ten (10) business days after (A) actual receipt of such refund
of Taxes and (B) with respect to the utilization of any Overpayment Credit,
actual reduction in the amount of any Taxes paid for a tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, in each case, net of any Taxes,
costs or expenses incurred by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, the
Company or its Subsidiary in connection with obtaining such Tax refund or
Overpayment Credit that were not previously reimbursed by the Sellers. After
the Closing, at the sole expense of the Sellers, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiary to continue to work in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to diligently prosecute any Tax refund (or Overpayment
Credit) claims in order to legally maximize and obtain any such Tax refunds
(or Overpayment Credits). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Purchaser shall request, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to
request, a refund (rather than a credit in lieu of refund) with respect to all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, to the extent the Sellers are entitled to any such
amount pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 11.01(a)(vi). In the
event that any Tax refund (or Overpayment Credit) that has been paid to the
Sellers pursuant to this Section 11.01(a)(vi) is subsequently denied by a Tax
Authority, the Sellers shall promptly repay such amount (including any related
interest or 

penalties imposed by such Tax Authority) to the Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiary, as applicable.

(y)Books and Records; Cooperation. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and
shall cause their respective representatives to, (i) provide the other party
and its representatives with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, including the filing of any
claim for refund resulting from a carryback of any net operating losses, or
any audit or other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiary or the computation or verification of amounts under this Section
11.01 and (ii) retain and provide the other party and its representatives with
reasonable access to all records or information that may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided thereunder, provided that the foregoing
shall be done at the expense of the party making such request and in a manner
so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
parties.

(z)Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, will each pay fifty percent (50%) of any stamp Tax, stock transfer
Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Company, its Subsidiary or the
Sellers as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties, interest or additions to
Tax with respect to the Transfer Taxes, and will indemnify and hold each other
harmless with respect to the amount of Transfer Taxes in excess of fifty
percent (50%) of the total amount of Transfer Taxes. Each Seller agrees to
cooperate with the Purchaser in the filing of any returns with respect to the
Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in their
possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

(aa)Amendment of Tax Returns. After the Closing, the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not permit
the Company or its Subsidiary to, (a) other than Tax Returns that are filed
pursuant to Section 11.01(a)(i) and (ii), file or amend or otherwise modify
any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) after the date any
Tax Returns filed pursuant to Section 11.01(a)(i) and (ii) is filed, amend or
otherwise modify any such Tax Return, (c) without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, extend
or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or
other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (d) make or change any Tax election or accounting method
or practice with respect to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or (e) make or initiate any voluntary contact with a Tax
Authority regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(ab)No Section 338 or Section 336 Election. The Purchaser shall not make any
election under Code Section 338 or Code Section 336 (or any similar provision
under Law) with respect to the acquisition of the Company and its Affiliates.

(ac)Straddle Period Allocation. To the extent it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period,
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the
Company and its Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
other pass-through entity in which the Company or its Subsidiary holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount
of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiary for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(ad)Tax Contests. If a claim for Taxes (including notice of a pending audit)
shall be made by any Governmental Entity (such Governmental Entity, a "Tax
Authority," and such claim, a "Tax Claim"), which, if successful, could result
in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, the party
first receiving written notice of such Tax Claim shall notify the other
parties within twenty 

(20) days of the receipt of such a Tax Claim. A failure by any party receiving
written notice of a Tax Claim to provide proper notice of a Tax Claim shall
not relieve any Indemnitor from its indemnification obligations under this
Agreement, except to the extent that such Indemnitor is actually and
materially prejudiced as a result thereof. The Sellers shall have the sole
right to represent the Company's and the Subsidiary's interests and to employ
counsel of their choice at their expense with respect to any Tax Claim to the
extent the Tax Claim is for one or more Pre-Closing Tax Periods and for which
they are required to indemnify the Purchaser and/or the Company, in full
(taking into account any limitations on indemnification), pursuant to Section
9.02; and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to execute
any powers of attorney necessary in order to allow the Sellers to control and
to settle any such Tax Claim; provided that any party to this Agreement shall
be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in any Tax Claim to the extent
it relates to a Tax for which such party bears any liability (whether by
operation of law or under this Agreement). No party may settle or otherwise
dispose of any Tax Claim for which another party may have a liability
hereunder without the prior written consent of such other party, which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



11.02 Further Assurances

. From time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto and at such
party's expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting party
may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.03 Efforts

.

(ae)From and after the date hereof, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Sellers agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under any applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner possible, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable and (ii) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser and
the Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions necessary to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in obtaining)
any regulatory or other approvals from any Governmental Entities (which
actions shall include furnishing all information required in connection with

not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is
or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and

shall be enforceable by, the DandO Indemnitees. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be

respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

13.12 Waiver of Trial by Jury

. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH

LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS

obligations under this Agreement, the prevailing party in any action or
proceeding in any court or arbitration in connection therewith shall be
entitled to recover from such other party its costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such action or proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable legal fees and associated court costs.

13.14 Electronic Delivery

. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the
extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or electronic mail (any such
delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense related to
lack of authenticity.

13.15 Counterparts

. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, any one of which
need not contain the signature of more than one party, but all such
counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

13.16 Governing Law 

. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits and
schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

13.17 Specific Performance

. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party hereto would be
irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this
Agreement by any party could not be adequately compensated in all cases by
monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy
to which any party may be entitled, at law or in equity, such party shall also
be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.
