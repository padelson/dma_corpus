\- iii -  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 17, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between Bank of Montreal, a Schedule I Bank under the
Bank Act (Canada) (" _Purchaser_ ") and Marshall and Ilsley Corporation, a
Wisconsin corporation (" _Company_ "). 

RECITALS

A. The Boards of Directors of Company and Purchaser have determined that it is
in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to
consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in
this Agreement in which Company will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Merger Sub (the "
_Merger_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ").

B. As an inducement and condition to the entrance of Purchaser into this
Agreement, Company and Purchaser are entering into a Stock Option Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the " _Option Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Company is
granting to Purchaser an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ").

 

C. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, a United States
Subsidiary of Purchaser (which shall be the direct parent of Merger Sub) ("
_Holdco_ "), will purchase each share of the Companys Senior Preferred Stock,
Series B, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
" _Series B Preferred Stock_ ") (such purchase, the " _TARP Purchase_ ") and
may purchase the Warrant issued by the Company on November 14, 2008 to the
United States Department of the Treasury (" _Treasury_ ") in connection with
the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock (the " _Company Warrant_ ")
(such purchase, the " _Warrant Purchase_ ").

D. The parties intend the Merger, together with the TARP Purchase, to qualify
(i) as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and intend for this
Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code and (ii) for an exception to the general rule of
Section 367(a)(1) of the Code.

 

E. Purchaser shall form or cause the formation of a Delaware limited liability
company and indirect, wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Merger Sub_ ")
and cause Merger Sub to join as a party to this Agreement in accordance with
its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the date hereof and
covenants to the extent made by and with respect to Merger Sub shall be
deemed to refer to the date of formation of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub
Effective Date_ ").

F. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with (i) the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_
") and (ii) the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the " _WBCL_ "), at the
Effective Time Company shall merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub shall
be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence under
the laws of the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Company shall cease.

(b) Subject to the consent of Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, Purchaser may at any time change the method of effecting
the combination and/or the method of effecting the TARP Purchase if and to the
extent requested by Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences of
the Merger to shareholders of Company or the tax treatment of the parties
pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be filed (i) with the
Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the " _DFI_
"), articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") as provided in Section
180.1105 of the WBCL, and (ii) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "), a certificate of merger as provided
in Section 18-209(c) of the DLLCA (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The
Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the
Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger. The term " _Effective Time_
" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in
the Articles of Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA.

1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) The common stock of Merger Sub, the terms of which shall be set forth in
the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Common Stock_ "), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall constitute, in addition to the New Surviving
Company Shares (issued pursuant to Section 1.4(h)), the only outstanding
common stock of the Surviving Company.

 



\- 2 -  (b) All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Company, Purchaser, Holdco or Merger Sub (other than shares of Company Common
Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned
by third parties, which shall include any shares of Company Common Stock held
in a rabbi or other trust for purposes of funding a Company Benefit Plan (any
such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of
Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Company, Purchaser,
Holdco or Merger Sub in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such
shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no stock of Purchaser or cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Company Common Stock shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Subject to Section 1.4(e), each share of Company Common Stock, including
Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares, but excluding all other
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company, Purchaser, Holdco or Merger
Sub, shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Article II, into the right to receive 0.1257 (the " _Merger Consideration_ ")
common shares, without nominal or par value, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser
Common Stock_ "), subject to the payment of any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

(d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each non-
certificated share of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares into which
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any
dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in
accordance with Section 2.3(c).

1.5 _Stock Options_.

director options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") will vest in full and then cease to represent an

(ii) the per share exercise price for each Company Stock Option will equal

the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such
option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option

deferred share of Company Common Stock, granted under any of the Company
Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares) (each, a " _Company
Stock Award_ ") shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time,
into a right or award with respect to Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser
will assume each Company Stock Award subject to its terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time the number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Award will equal the product of (a)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Award immediately before the Effective Time and (b) the Merger Consideration,

following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Award shall continue to be

payment in respect of the Company Performance Units shall be made to the
holders thereof as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time

Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(c) of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint a
bank or trust company selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to
Company, or Purchasers transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the "
_Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") hereunder.

 



\- 6 -  2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall (a) authorize the Exchange Agent to deliver an aggregate
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration and (b) deposit, or cause to be deposited with, the Exchange
Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

2.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s)
or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s))) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such
other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder
of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the
Effective Time the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by its Certificate(s) or Book Entry Shares. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall represent after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without
interest, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented
thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article
II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of
Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender
date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Purchaser
Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 



\- 7 -  (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock
transfer records of Company, the shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock comprising the Merger
Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by
reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that the tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-
year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination
of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Purchaser or the Surviving Company) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or
Purchaser, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent, Purchaser or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the
case may be.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Article II.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Purchaser shall pay to each
former shareholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth, of the
closing sale prices of Purchaser Common Stock based on information reported
by the Toronto Stock Exchange (" _TSX_ ") as reported in _The Toronto Stock
Exchange Daily Record_ (with each such trading days applicable price
converted into United States dollars using the noon rate of exchange reported
with respect to such day by the Bank of Canada) for the five (5) trading days
immediately preceding the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 



\- 8 -  (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company as of the one year anniversary of the Effective Time
may be paid to Purchaser. In such event, any former shareholders of Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Purchaser with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Purchaser, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Purchaser may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

to applicable Law (and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith), except where the failure to hold such license,
franchise, permit or authorization or to pay such fees or assessments would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, no
suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or
authorization has, prior to the date hereof, been threatened in
writing. Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material

\- 29 -  4.11 _Absence of Changes_. Since October 31, 2010, no event or events
have occurred that have had or would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

Subsidiaries that is provided by Purchaser or its representatives for

impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger,

the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) result in gain recognition
to the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to Section
367(a) of the Code (assuming that, in the case of any such holder who would be
treated as a "five-percent transferee shareholder" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such holder enters into a
five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8, as provided for in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B), and complies with the requirements of that
agreement and Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding the
recognition of gain). Purchaser will satisfy the "active trade or business
test" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.367(a)-3(c)(3)) applicable
with respect to the Merger.

file with the SEC the Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included
as a prospectus. Each of Purchaser and Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company shall thereafter mail
or deliver the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Purchaser shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Company shall furnish all
information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(a) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger, the TARP Purchase and the Warrant Purchase),
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental
Entities. Company and Purchaser shall have the right to review in advance,
and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws, all the information relating to Company or
Purchaser, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall consult with the other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or
its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences; _provided_ that Purchaser shall be permitted to redact from
copies provided to Company of written materials submitted or intended for
submission by Purchaser to OSFI, information relating to the business or
operations of Purchaser to the extent that access to such information is not
required for Company to reasonably assess the status of matters relating to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
Purchaser need not include Company in meetings, or portions of meetings,
between Purchaser (or any of its affiliates) and OSFI in which the business or
operations of Purchaser will be discussed with OSFI, provided that if such
a discussion is germane to the status of matters relating to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser will promptly
inform Company of the occurrence of such a meeting and the general subject
discussed and provide Company with summary information conveying the import
of the matters discussed.

 



\- 34 -  (b) Each of Purchaser and Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Purchaser,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (1) the Form F-4 will, at the
time the Form F-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Companys meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of Purchaser and Company further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Form F-4 or the
Proxy Statement.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser
and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any applicable law so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Purchaser, Company and
their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained
in this Agreement shall require Purchaser to take any actions specified in
this Section 6.1(c) that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to Company) on
Purchaser or Company.

 



\- 35 -  (d) Purchaser agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company, at or prior to the
Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of Companys outstanding debt,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the
terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

(e) Each of Purchaser and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

(f) Purchaser shall cause Holdco and the Surviving Company to comply with the
"reporting requirements" of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of Purchaser,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and, during such period, Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to Purchaser (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents
that Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Purchaser may reasonably request. Upon the reasonable request of Company,
Purchaser shall furnish such reasonable information about it and its business
as is relevant to Company and its shareholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Company nor Purchaser,
nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements
entered into between the parties as of December 9, 2010 and December 15, 2010
(the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ ").

 



\- 36 -  (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect or
be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or covenants of
the other party set forth in this Agreement.

6.3  _Shareholder A_ pproval. The Board of Directors of Company has resolved
to recommend to Companys shareholders that they approve this Agreement and
will submit to its shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required
to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of
this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, Company will take, in
accordance with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws,
all action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as
practicable, to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement as well as
any other such matters. The Board of Directors of Company will use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders a vote approving this
Agreement. However, if the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation
with (and based on the advice of) outside counsel, determines in good faith
that, because of the receipt by Company of an Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal, it would more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement,
then in submitting this Agreement to Companys shareholders, the Board of
Directors of Company may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;  _provided_
that Company may not take any actions under this sentence until after giving
Purchaser at least three business days to respond to any such Acquisition
Proposal or other circumstances giving rise to such particular proposed
action (and after giving Purchaser notice of the latest material terms,
conditions and identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal or
describe in reasonable detail such other circumstances) and then taking into
account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
Purchaser. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the
Company of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders for a
vote. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

6.4 _TSX and NYSE Listing_. Purchaser shall cause the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to have been authorized for listing on
the TSX and NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively employed by Company and
its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide
employee benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and
its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), as applicable;
_provided_ that (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen Purchaser Plan; and (ii) until such time
as Purchaser shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Purchaser
Plans, a Covered Employees continued participation in employee benefit plans
and compensation opportunities of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that
participation in the Purchaser Plans may commence at different times with
respect to each Purchaser Plan). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to maintain the Companys Reduction in Force Severance Policy (as
amended) without amendment following the Effective Time (the " _Company
Severance Plan_ ") and provide each Covered Employee whose employment is
terminated (other than under circumstances that constitute a termination for
"cause" or who are not otherwise party to an individual agreement that
provides for severance pay) during the one-year period following the Effective
Time with severance under the Company Severance Plan. ;  _provided_ that, the
severance benefits provided to a terminated Covered Employee shall be
determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time
in compensation paid to such Covered Employee and may be conditioned on
the Covered Employee signing a separation and general release agreement in
the form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. In addition, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor the obligations with respect to
Companys retiree medical program as set forth in Section 6.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



\- 37 -  (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Purchaser Plan, Purchaser shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i)
recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its
Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual (other than for purposes of benefit accruals
under any Purchaser Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan), under such
Purchaser Plan, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service (A) shall not
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to
the same period of service and (B) shall not apply for purposes of any
Purchaser Plan under which similarly-situated employees of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service; and (ii) with respect to
any Purchaser Plan that provides health plan or other welfare benefits in
which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in
which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, use its
reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations
or eligibility waiting periods under such Purchaser Plan to be waived with
respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
recognize any health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year
that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Purchaser Plan. For purposes of any cash balance pension plan maintained
or contributed to by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered
Employees become eligible to participate following the Effective Time, the
Covered Employees level of benefit accruals under any such plans (for periods
of service following the Effective Time) shall be determined based on the
Covered Employees credited service prior to the Effective Time (as recognized
for the same purpose by Company for purposes of the tax-qualified retirement
plans maintained or sponsored by Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time) and with the Surviving Company following the Effective Time.

 



\- 38 -  (c) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing
Date, Company shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to terminate the
Company Retirement Savings Plan or any 401(k) plan of any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). Company shall provide Purchaser
with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments evidencing that the
Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated in accordance with its terms. Prior to
the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), Company and Purchaser shall
take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to the
Company 401(k) Plan and/or the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement
plan designated by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") to (i) permit
each Covered Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
including of loans) in the form of cash, shares of Parent Common Stock, notes
(in the case of loans) or a combination thereof, in an amount equal to the
full account balance distributed to such Company Employee from the Company
401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, and (ii) obtain from the IRS a
favorable determination letter on termination for the Company 401(k) Plan.
Each Covered Employee shall become a participant in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan
on the Closing Date (giving effect to the service crediting provisions of
Section 6.5(b)); it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation
in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

(d) If requested by Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) business
days prior to the Effective Time, effective as of, and contingent upon, the
Closing Date, Company shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments terminate
each Company Benefit Plan listed in Section 6.5(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each, a " _Terminated Benefit Plan_ "). Company shall provide
Purchaser with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments evidencing
that each Terminated Benefit Plan has been terminated. Each Covered Employee
or other eligible participant shall become a participant in the Purchaser
benefit plan that is comparable to the Terminated Benefit Plan on the Closing
Date (giving effect to the service crediting provisions of Section 6.5(b)), it
being agreed that there shall be no gap in coverage under, or participation
in, any benefit plan or program of the type that Purchaser requests Company to
terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Company be
required to terminate the Companys Flex Benefit Plan until December 31,
2011, unless Purchaser makes arrangements, including amendments to the
Purchaser flex benefit plans, to ensure that the participants in the Companys
Flex Benefit Plan for the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs are able to have the full plan year in which to use the amounts
elected under such plan and are not otherwise adversely impacted.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of
applicable law, Purchaser shall honor all obligations to current and former
employees of Company and its Subsidiaries under the Company Benefit Plans,
including all employment or severance agreements entered into by Company or
its Subsidiaries or adopted by the Board of Directors of Company. From and
after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, take all action necessary to effectuate the agreements
set forth in Section 6.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



\- 39 -  (f) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan
or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 6.5 be construed to require the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to
retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period
of time following the Closing Date. This Agreement shall inure exclusively to
the benefit of, and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors, assigns, executors and legal representatives. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any person other than
the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plans_ " means each
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not
subject to ERISA, and each employment, consulting, bonus, incentive or
deferred compensation, retirement or post-retirement, vacation, stock option,
stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based or other equity-based,
severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-sharing, fringe
benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether
written or unwritten, for the benefit of any employee, former
employee, director or former director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
entered into, maintained or contributed to by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to
contribute, or with respect to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise (including any
liability arising out of an indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or
similar agreement) or otherwise providing benefits to any current, former or
future employee, officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
to any beneficiary or dependant thereof.

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Purchaser and the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law (and shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification),
each present and former director, officer and employee of Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Option Agreement; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 



\- 40 -  (b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, Purchaser will provide directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified
Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for Company)
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided
by Company; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser be required to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 350% of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for any such insurance (the "
_Premium Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such annual expense at
any time would exceed the Premium Cap, then Purchaser will cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. At the option of Company,
prior to the Effective Time and in lieu of the foregoing, Company may purchase
a tail policy for directors and officers liability insurance on the terms
described in the prior sentence (including subject to the Premium Cap) and
fully pay for such policy prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Purchaser; _provided_ that failure to so
notify will not affect the obligations of Purchaser under Section 6.6(a)
unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually and materially prejudiced
as a consequence.

(d) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Purchaser will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser will
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Purchaser and Company shall each take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.8 _No Solicitation_. 

(a) Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to,
initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, in
the event Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and
the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is more likely than not to result in
a Superior Proposal, Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
Subsidiaries representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent
that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (and based on
the advice of outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be more
likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or engaging in any
negotiations, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such third party on terms no less favorable to Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement of December 9, 2010. Company will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons
other than Purchaser with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to (x) enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and
(y) within ten business days after the date hereof, request and confirm the
return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person
(other than Purchaser and its affiliates) pursuant to any such
confidentiality or similar agreement. Company will promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) advise Purchaser following receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Purchaser promptly apprised
of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

 



\- 41 -  (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or
exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power
in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or
deposits of, Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any sale of whole loans and
securitizations in the ordinary course and any _bona fide_
internal reorganization.

As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes
in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a
nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any
other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more
than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to "a majority."

6.9 _Takeover Laws_. No party will take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreement, to
be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect.

 



\- 42 -  6.10 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
30 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date hereof,
Company will furnish to Purchaser (a) consolidated financial statements
(including balance sheets, statements of operations and stockholders equity)
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent available) as of and for
such month then ended, (b) internal management reports showing actual
financial performance against plan and previous period, and (c) to the extent
permitted by applicable law, any reports provided to Companys Board of
Directors or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and
risk management of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company and Purchaser will give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII. 

6.12 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Purchaser the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Option Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Purchasers prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

6.13 _Dividend Reinvestment_. Company shall take all necessary action to
terminate any dividend reinvestment plans and stock purchase plans effective
as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement (taking into account any
Company dividends that have been declared but not yet paid as of the date
hereof). In addition, upon the effective termination of any dividend
reinvestment plan, each participants account will continue to be maintained
with Companys transfer agent in accordance with the terms of such plan. Cash
will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares upon distribution.

6.14 _Restructuring Efforts_. If Company shall have failed to obtain the
required vote of its shareholders for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its shareholders or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good
faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transactions provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall
have any obligation to alter or change any material terms of this Agreement,
including the amount or kind of the merger consideration, in a manner adverse
to such party or its shareholders) and/or to resubmit the transaction to
Companys shareholders for approval.

 



\- 43 -  6.15 _TRUPS Redemption_. Company shall take all action necessary to effect, or
cause to be effected, at least three business days prior to the Closing Date,
but contingent upon the occurrence thereof, the redemption of all outstanding
junior subordinated debt securities issued to any trust Subsidiary of Company,
including Gold Banc Trust III, Gold Banc Trust IV, Gold Banc Capital Trust V
and Trustcorp Statutory Trust I, and the concurrent redemption of all
preferred capital securities issued by such trust Subsidiaries, in each case
in accordance with the terms thereof and the indentures related thereto.

waiver by Purchaser, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following

Section 368(b) of the Code and (ii) and that the Merger will not result in
gain recognition to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
367(a) of the Code (assuming that, in the case of any such holder who would be
treated as a "five-percent transferee shareholder" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such holder enters into a
five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8, as provided for in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B), and complies with the requirements of that

individually or in the aggregate, would, after the Effective Time, restrict
or burden Purchaser or Surviving Company or any of their respective
affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or with respect to the business or operations of Purchaser or Surviving
Company that would have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, Surviving
Company or any of their respective affiliates, in each case measured on a
scale relative to Company.

 



\- 45 -  (e) _TARP_. Holdco shall have purchased from Treasury, and shall beneficially
own all right, title and interest in, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price
equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the

date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as though made on and as
of the Effective Time (except that representations and warranties that by
their terms speak specifically as of the date of this Agreement or another
date shall be true and correct as of such date); _provided_ , _however_ , that
no representation or warranty of Purchaser shall be deemed untrue or incorrect

facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation
or warranty of Purchaser has had or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that for

correct for purposes of this Section 7.3(a), any qualification or exception
for, or reference to, materiality (including the terms "material,"
"materially," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse Effect"
or similar terms or phrases) in any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded; and Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Purchaser by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of
Purchaser to the foregoing effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Purchaser_. Purchaser shall have performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Purchaser by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Purchaser to such effect.

(c) _Tax Opinion_. Company shall have received an opinion of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, dated the Closing Date and based on facts,

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code and (ii) and
that the Merger will not result in gain recognition to the holders of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code (assuming that, in the
case of any such holder who would be treated as a "five-percent transferee
shareholder" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), such holder enters into a five-year gain recognition
agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8, as
provided for in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B), and
complies with the requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations

opinion, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz will be entitled to receive and rely
upon customary certificates and representations of officers of Purchaser,

shareholders, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

(g) by Purchaser, if a tender or exchange offer for 20% or more of the

recommends that its shareholders tender their shares in such tender or
exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject
such tender or exchange offer within the 10 business day period specified in

(h) by Company, if its Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith
by a majority vote that Purchaser has substantially engaged in bad faith in

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts

other than the Confidentiality Agreements.

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed entirely within such state, without giving effect
to its principles of conflicts of laws; _provided_ that the WBCL, including

Wisconsin corporation, shall govern as applicable. The parties hereto agree
that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties
hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from
present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each
party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

 

9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any

or relating to, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this

or otherwise make any public statement, or, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic information to a
third party, concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of Purchaser, in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or
disclosure by Company, or Company, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that either
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after

in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Article III, or to one or more covenants contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and

warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means information set
forth by Company in the applicable paragraph of its Company Disclosure
Schedule, or any other paragraph of its Company Disclosure Schedule (so long

paragraph of its Company Disclosure Schedule is also applicable to the section
of this Agreement in question).
