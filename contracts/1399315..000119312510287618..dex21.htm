by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, Company will take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a
meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as practicable, to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement as well as any other such matters. The Board of Directors of Company will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders a
vote approving this Agreement. However, if the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) outside counsel, determines in good faith that, because of the receipt by Company of an Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this
