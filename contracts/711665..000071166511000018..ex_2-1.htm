AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of July 4, 2011 by and among Radiancy, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Radiancy"), PhotoMedex, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("PhotoMedex"), and PHMD
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
PhotoMedex ("Merger Sub"). Radiancy, PhotoMedex and Merger Sub are sometimes
referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties".

  

  

WITNESSETH:

  

  

A. The Parties intend to effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Radiancy (the "Merger"), with Radiancy continuing as the surviving entity in
the Merger, and as a result of which all issued and outstanding common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Radiancy (the "Radiancy Common Stock"), will be
deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined hereafter) upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporations Law, as amended (the "DGCL").

  

  

B. Each of the board of directors of Radiancy (the "Radiancy Board"), the
board of directors of PhotoMedex (the "PhotoMedex Board") and the board of
directors of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Board"), respectively, has approved
this Agreement and each of them has determined that this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the
respective best interests of each of Radiancy, PhotoMedex and Merger Sub,
respectively, and their respective stockholders.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  


 

  

  

TERMS OF THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as hereafter defined), Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into Radiancy. Upon the consummation of the
Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and
Radiancy, as the surviving company in the Merger (hereafter sometimes referred
to as the "Surviving Company"), shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of PhotoMedex.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) On the Closing Date, PhotoMedex shall (i) cause to be paid or issued to

Effective Time, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the allocation attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1(b)(i) (the "Radiancy
Stockholder Allocation"), newly issued common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of PhotoMedex (the "PhotoMedex Common Stock") equal to the sum of [A]
the number of shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock that is equal to three (3)
times the number of shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (including,
for these purposes, any shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock that are issuable
upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding convertible securities of
PhotoMedex having a conversion price or exercise price that is less than
$25.00 per share, but excluding those certain options to purchase 95,200
shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock which are provided for in the employment
agreements of Messrs. Dennis McGrath and Michael Stewart), plus [B] Three
Million Forty Thousand (3,040,000) shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock
(collectively, the "Merger Consideration") and (ii) cause to be paid or issued
to the stockholders of record of PhotoMedex entitled to vote for or against
the Merger at the stockholder meeting (the "PhotoMedex Stockholders") to
approve the Merger, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, warrants to purchase an aggregate of Nine Hundred Forty One
Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty Seven (941,667) shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock
(the "Warrants"), of which warrants to purchase 95,200 shares of PhotoMedex
Common Stock will instead be issued as options to Messrs. Dennis McGrath and
Michael Stewart under their employment agreements with PhotoMedex, such
Warrants to be issued pro rata to such stockholders based upon the number of
issued and outstanding shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock held by each such
holder on the record date (the "PhotoMedex Stockholder Allocation").

  

  

(c) Intentionally Omitted.

  

  

(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, PhotoMedex shall cause
Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. (or such other Person as may be
mutually agreed upon by the Parties, the "Exchange Agent") to mail each holder
of record holding a Radiancy Common Stock certificate (the "Certificate") a
letter of transmittal as prepared by PhotoMedex and reasonably acceptable to
Radiancy (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
actual receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or
Certificates for exchange, together with such properly completed letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and any other documents and instruments reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore a certificate representing
the number of whole PhotoMedex Common Stock to which such holder of Radiancy
Common Stock shall have become entitled to hereunder and in accordance with
the Radiancy Stockholder Allocation, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) If any certificate representing PhotoMedex Common Stock is to be issued in
a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition to the
issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
Taxes (as defined below) required by reason of the issuance in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

  

(f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Radiancy of the shares of Radiancy Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Radiancy Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (properly endorsed or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.1.

  

  

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to PhotoMedex. Any former stockholders of Radiancy who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 1.1 shall thereafter look only to
PhotoMedex (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws (as defined below)) for payment of the Merger
Consideration to such stockholder as determined pursuant to this Agreement and
without any interest thereon. Any consideration remaining unclaimed
immediately prior to such time when such consideration would otherwise escheat
or become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined below),
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
PhotoMedex, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Radiancy, PhotoMedex,
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such
Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Law.

  

  

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
PhotoMedex, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as PhotoMedex
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(i) The Warrants shall be in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
1.1(i) and shall have the terms set forth therein, including, without
limitation, (i) a warrant exercise price of Twenty Dollars ($20.00) per share
of PhotoMedex Common Stock, (ii) an exercise period of three (3) years
following the Effective Time, and (iii) notwithstanding the three-year
exercise period, the right of PhotoMedex to notify the holders of Warrants of
an earlier expiration of the Warrants at any time following such time as the
PhotoMedex Common

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Stock will have had a closing trading price in excess of Thirty Dollars
($30.00) per share for a period of twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days,
provided that such earlier expiration date shall not be earlier than that date
which is twenty (20) Business Days following the delivery of such notification
by PhotoMedex. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, PhotoMedex
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail the Warrants to each holder of record
of PhotoMedex Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the PhotoMedex Stockholder Allocation.

  

  

(j) At the Effective Time, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Radiancy,
PhotoMedex or Merger Sub, shall be converted into one share of the Surviving
Company.

  

  

(k) By virtue of the Merger, (i) the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company, and (ii) the by-laws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Company.

  

  

(l) At and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, the Surviving Company shall possess all properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Radiancy and Merger Sub and all of the
claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of Radiancy and Merger Sub
shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Surviving Company.

  

  

(m) Tax Withholding. PhotoMedex, the Surviving Company and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable in accordance with this Agreement such amounts as
PhotoMedex, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent reasonably believe
are required by applicable Law (including, without limitation, Israeli Tax
Laws). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by PhotoMedex, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Radiancy Stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by PhotoMedex, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 1.1(m), PhotoMedex, the
Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, shall: (i) not
withhold any amounts in the event that the Israeli Tax Ruling (as defined in
Section 5.13 below) is obtained, unless such withholding (if any) is made only
in accordance with the provisions of said Israeli Tax Ruling; (ii) comply with
a withholding Tax extension (if obtained); (iii) not withhold any amounts
pursuant for Israeli Tax purposes if the recipient has represented to
PhotoMedex, the Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, in
an Israeli tax declaration which will be attached to a letter of transmittal
(the "Israeli Tax Declaration") that the recipient is not a resident of the
State of Israel; and (iv) not withhold or withhold a reduced Tax amount if the
recipient has provided a Valid Certificate at least three (3) Business Days
prior to any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement. A "Valid Certificate"
shall be a certificate or ruling issued by the Israeli Tax Authority (the
"ITA") which is sufficient to enable PhotoMedex, the Surviving Company or the
Escrow Agent, as the case may be, to conclude that no withholding (or reduced
withholding) of Israeli Tax is required

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

with respect to such recipient.

  

  

1.2 The Closing; Effective Time; Effect

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
Section 7.1 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place by the exchange of original or facsimile or electronic copies of this
Agreement and each ancillary agreement hereto at 10:00 a.m. (EST) no later
than the third Business Day (as defined herein) after the date that all of the
closing conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) unless
another time, date or place is agreed upon in writing by the Parties hereto;
provided, however, that the Closing shall occur, subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, no later than January 31,
2012 (the "Drop Dead Date"). The date on which the Closing occurs is herein
referred to as the "Closing Date."

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, concurrently with the Closing
and after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI, the Parties shall as promptly as practicable cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of State") a certificate of merger for the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL (referred to herein as the "Certificate of
Merger"), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in order to
effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger or at such other time (on or before the Drop Dead Date)
as is agreed in writing by the Parties hereto and specified in the Certificate
of Merger. The time when the Merger shall become effective is herein referred
to as the "Effective Time."

  

  

1.3 Escrow

  

  

.

  

  

(a) At Closing, PhotoMedex, Radiancy, the PhotoMedex Representative (as
defined below), the Radiancy Representative (as defined below) and Broadridge
Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. (or such other Person as may be mutually
agreed upon by the Parties, the "Escrow Agent") shall enter into an Escrow
Agreement, in the form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties
(the "Escrow Agreement") and PhotoMedex shall deposit with the Escrow Agent
certificates representing Eight Hundred Thousand (800,000) shares of
PhotoMedex Common Stock (the "Escrow Securities"). As the remedy of PhotoMedex
and the PhotoMedex Indemnified Parties (as defined below), on one hand, or as
the remedy of Radiancy and the Radiancy Indemnified Parties (as defined
below), on the other hand, the Escrow Securities shall be applied to satisfy
any PhotoMedex indemnification claims or Radiancy indemnification claims
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.18. Upon release from escrow, the
Escrow Securities shall be allocated in accordance with the PhotoMedex
Stockholder Allocation in the event of a PhotoMedex indemnification claim or
allocated in accordance with the Radiancy Stockholder Allocation in the event
of a

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Radiancy indemnification claim. The Escrow Securities shall no longer be
subject to any PhotoMedex Claim or Radiancy Claim after the six (6) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Claim Termination Date"); provided,
however, that with respect to any PhotoMedex Claim(s) and/or Radiancy Claim(s)
that remains unresolved at the time of the Claim Termination Date and notice
of which was properly and timely delivered pursuant to Section 5.18, a portion
of the Escrow Securities reasonably necessary to satisfy such claim(s) shall
remain subject to escrow until such time as such claim(s) shall have been
finally resolved pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.18 and, in the event
the aggregate amount of the unresolved claim(s) is in excess of the value of
the remaining Escrow Securities in the escrow fund (as calculated pursuant to
the next sentence), all such Escrow Securities shall remain subject to escrow
until final resolution of such claim(s). For purposes of satisfying any
Damages (as defined below) incurred by PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex
Indemnified Parties pursuant to a PhotoMedex Claim or Radiancy and the
Radiancy Indemnified Parties pursuant to a Radiancy Claim, as the case may be,
the Escrow Securities shall be deemed to be valued at the average closing
trading price of PhotoMedex Common Stock for the period beginning ten (10)
Trading Days prior to the date of this Agreement and ending ten (10) Trading
Days after the date of this Agreement. Any Escrow Securities released to the
Radiancy Stockholders shall be deemed to be Merger Consideration. Any Escrow
Securities remaining in escrow after the Claim Termination Date and not
subject to any unresolved PhotoMedex Claim or Radiancy Claim shall be
cancelled.

  

  

(b) The Parties agree that (i) Dr. Yoav Ben-Dror shall be appointed as the
Radiancy Representative and the attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the
Radiancy Stockholders with respect to this Section 1.3, Section 5.18 and the
Escrow Agreement and the taking by the Radiancy Representative of any and all
actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by
him or her under this Section 1.3, Section 5.18 or the Escrow Agreement; and
(ii) James W. Sight shall be appointed as the PhotoMedex Representative and
the attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the PhotoMedex Stockholders with
respect to this Section 1.3, Section 5.18 and the Escrow Agreement and the
taking by the PhotoMedex Representative of any and all actions and the making
of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by him or her under this
Section 1.3, Section 5.18 or the Escrow Agreement; including in each case the
exercise of the power to (i) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of and comply with orders of courts with respect to any
indemnification claims, (ii) resolve any indemnification claims, and (iii)
take all actions necessary in the judgment of the Radiancy Representative or
the PhotoMedex Representative, as the case may be, for the accomplishment of
the other terms, conditions and limitations of this Section 1.3, Section 5.18
and the Escrow Agreement. Each Party and the Escrow Agent shall only be
required to acknowledge or act upon written communication signed by the
Radiancy Representative and/or the PhotoMedex Representative. No bond shall be
required of the Radiancy Representative or the PhotoMedex Representative, and
neither the Radiancy Representative nor the PhotoMedex Representative shall
receive any compensation for his or her services under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement with respect to the Escrow Securities and any indemnification
claims hereunder. The Radiancy Representative shall have no liability
whatsoever to the Radiancy Stockholders relating to his or her service as
Radiancy Representative (including any action taken or omitted to be taken),
except that he or she shall be liable for harm that he or she directly causes
by an act of willful misconduct. The PhotoMedex Representative shall have no
liability whatsoever to the PhotoMedex Stockholders relating to his

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

   
 

or her service as PhotoMedex Representative (including any action taken or
omitted to be taken), except that he or she shall be liable for harm that he
or she directly causes by an act of willful misconduct. PhotoMedex shall pay
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants) incurred by the
Radiancy Representative or the PhotoMedex Representative, as the case may be,
in connection with the performance of his or her respective obligations as the
Radiancy Representative or the PhotoMedex Representative, as the case may be,
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

1.4 Other Effects of the Merger

  

  

. The Merger shall have all further effects as specified in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

  

  

1.5 Additional Actions

  

  

. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances
or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Radiancy
or Merger Sub, or otherwise carry out this Agreement, the officers of the
Surviving Company shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of Radiancy and Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
Radiancy or Merger Sub, all such other actions and things as may be necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Company or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

  

  

1.6 Organic Anti-Dilution

  

  

. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into PhotoMedex Common
Stock), dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to
PhotoMedex Common Stock (each, an "Organic Dilution Event") occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the issuance, conversion or other like change of the Merger
Consideration (and the securities underlying the Merger Consideration) as
contemplated by Section 1.1 of this Agreement shall not be deemed an Organic
Dilution Event, and/or (ii) the issuance of PhotoMedex Common Stock and/or
other securities of PhotoMedex pursuant to any exercise or conversion of
securities of PhotoMedex issued and outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement shall not be deemed an Organic Dilution Event.

  

  

1.7 Tax Consequences

  

  

. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) and Section
368(a)(2)(E) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) and Section
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

  

  

1.8 Treatment of Options

  

  

. The Radiancy Board shall take such necessary steps to provide that (i) all
Radiancy options that are issued and outstanding under any Radiancy option or
incentive plan shall be accelerated and vested and become exercisable into
shares of Radiancy Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) any
options not exercised prior to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the Effective Time shall terminate as of the Effective Time. PhotoMedex
options which remain unexercised at the Effective Time will remain
outstanding.

  


 

  

1.9 Dissenting Stockholders; Appraisal Rights

  

  

. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if holders of
shares of Radiancy Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date (the "Appraisal Shares") properly demand appraisal
pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section 262 of the DGCL, the Appraisal
Shares shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section
1.1, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder of Appraisal Shares shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Date into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.1.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  


 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PHOTOMEDEX AND MERGER SUB

  

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by PhotoMedex to
Radiancy on the date hereof (the "PhotoMedex Disclosure Letter"), the Section
numbers of which are numbered to correspond to the Section numbers of this
Agreement to which they refer (provided, however, that an item disclosed in
any Section of the PhotoMedex Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to have been
disclosed on all other Sections of this Agreement (if such disclosure is in
sufficient detail to make it readily apparent to a reasonable Person that such
disclosure applies to the other Sections thereof to which such disclosure is
responsive)), PhotoMedex and Merger Sub represent and warrant to Radiancy as
follows:

  

  

2.1 Due Organization and Good Standing

  

  

. Each of PhotoMedex and each wholly owned or partially owned subsidiary of
PhotoMedex (each a "PhotoMedex Subsidiary") is a corporation, limited
liability company or other entity, duly incorporated, formed, or organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, formation, or organization and has all requisite corporate,
limited liability, or other organizational power and authority to own, lease
and operate its respective properties and to carry on its respective business
as now being conducted. Each of PhotoMedex and each PhotoMedex Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the property owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to result in a
PhotoMedex Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). PhotoMedex has
heretofore made available to Radiancy accurate and complete copies of
PhotoMedex's articles of incorporation and by-laws, as amended to date and as
currently in effect (the "PhotoMedex Organization Documents"), and the
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent organizational document of
each of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries, each as amended to date and as currently
in

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

   
 

effect (the "PhotoMedex Subsidiary Organization Documents"). None of
PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary is in violation of any PhotoMedex
Organization Document or PhotoMedex Subsidiary Organization Document, as the
case may be.

  


 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "PhotoMedex Material Adverse Effect"
shall mean any change or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has,
or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect upon the
financial condition or operating results of PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except any changes or effects directly or
indirectly attributable to, resulting from, relating to or arising out of the
following (by themselves or when aggregated with any other, changes or
effects) shall not be deemed to be, constitute, or be taken into account when
determining whether there has or may, would, or could have occurred a
PhotoMedex Material Adverse Effect: (i) the effect of any change in the
general political, economic, financial, capital market or industry-wide
conditions (except to the extent that PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary
is affected in a disproportionate manner relative to other companies in the
industries in which PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries conduct
business), (ii) the effect of any change that generally affects any industry
or market in which PhotoMedex or any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries operate to
the extent that it does not disproportionately affect, individually or in
aggregate, PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
relative to other participants in the industries in which PhotoMedex and the
PhotoMedex Subsidiaries operate, (iii) the effect of any change arising in
connection with any international or national calamity, commencement,
continuation or escalation of a war, armed hostilities or act of terrorism
which does not disproportionately affect PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, relative to other participants in the
industries in which PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries operate; (iv)
the announcement of the execution of this Agreement, the pendency of or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions expressly contemplated
hereby, (v) any change in applicable Law or GAAP (as defined below) or
interpretation thereof, (vi) the execution by PhotoMedex and performance of or
compliance by PhotoMedex with this Agreement or the taking of any action
expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, (vii) any shareholder
litigation brought or threatened against PhotoMedex, Merger Sub or any member
of the PhotoMedex Board or Merger Sub Board by shareholder(s) of PhotoMedex
owning less than ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding PhotoMedex
Common Stock in the aggregate in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (viii) changes in the market price or trading volume of
the PhotoMedex Common Stock (provided that the underlying causes of such
changes shall not be excluded), (ix) any matter disclosed in the PhotoMedex
Disclosure Letter or (x) any failure to meet any financial or other
projections.

there are no (i) outstanding options, warrants, puts, calls, convertible

exchangeable into securities having such rights, or (iii) except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, subscriptions or other rights, agreements,
arrangements, contracts or commitments of any character, relating to the
issued or unissued capital equity of PhotoMedex or obligating PhotoMedex to

delivered, sold or repurchased any options, capital stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such securities, or obligating PhotoMedex
to grant, extend or enter into any option, warrant, call, subscription or
other right, agreement, arrangement or commitment for such securities.

  

  

The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 100 shares of common stock are
issued and outstanding. No other shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of Merger Sub are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All
outstanding shares of Merger Sub common stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation
of any purchase option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the PhotoMedex
Subsidiary Organization Documents or any contract to which Merger Sub is a
party or by which Merger Sub is bound. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of Merger Sub to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Merger Sub common stock or any capital equity of Merger Sub. There
are no outstanding contractual obligations of Merger Sub to provide funds to,
or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or

Subsidiaries. There are no (i) outstanding options, warrants, puts, calls,
convertible securities, preemptive or similar rights, (ii) bonds, debentures,

equity of, or other equity interests in, any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries or
obligating any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, deliver or
sell or cause to be issued, transferred, delivered, sold or repurchased any
options, equity interest or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such securities, or obligating any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries to grant,
extend or enter into any option, warrant, call, subscription or other right,
agreement, arrangement or commitment for such securities. There are no
outstanding obligations of PhotoMedex or any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem (except

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

10

(Section 906) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act")
with respect to any report referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above
(collectively, the "Certifications"). The SEC Reports were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations thereunder. The SEC Reports did not, at the time they
were filed with the SEC (except to the extent that information contained in
any SEC Report has been revised or superseded by a later filed SEC Report, in
which case on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Certifications
were each true and correct on the date made. To the extent required by the

controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the

made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the

Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of PhotoMedex, each director and executive
officer of PhotoMedex has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements

in the SEC Reports (the "PhotoMedex Financials") fairly present the financial
condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and

dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements, all in
accordance with (i) GAAP and (ii) Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as
applicable, subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal
recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or
in the aggregate, be materially adverse) and the omission of notes to the
extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable. To the
extent required by the Exchange Act, PhotoMedex has designed and maintains a
system of internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. No financial statements other than those of PhotoMedex and the
PhotoMedex Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of PhotoMedex. Section 2.7(b) of the

the-Shelf Software Agreements, that is licensed to PhotoMedex or any of the
PhotoMedex Subsidiaries and is material to the business of PhotoMedex

be expected to result in a PhotoMedex Material Adverse Effect, each of
PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries (x) has all right, title and
interest in and to PhotoMedex Intellectual Property owned by it, free and
clear of all Encumbrances, other than rights and interest licensed to any
other Person and Permitted Encumbrances, and (y) has valid rights to use the

PhotoMedex, there is no valid basis for any such allegation. Except as set
forth in Section 2.15(a)(iv) of the PhotoMedex Disclosure Letter, to

nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will materially
impair or materially alter PhotoMedex's or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary's rights
to any PhotoMedex Intellectual Property or PhotoMedex Licensed Intellectual
Property. To PhotoMedex's knowledge, all of PhotoMedex Intellectual Property
and the license rights to the PhotoMedex Licensed Intellectual Property are

challenges the rights of PhotoMedex or any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries in
any material respect of any PhotoMedex Intellectual Property or PhotoMedex
Licensed Intellectual Property or the validity, enforceability or
effectiveness thereof. PhotoMedex Intellectual Property and the PhotoMedex
Licensed Intellectual Property constitute all material Intellectual Property
owned by or licensed to PhotoMedex or the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries and used in

expected to result in a PhotoMedex Material Adverse Effect.

otherwise, remain for the benefit of, or relating to, any present or former
employee, consultant, manager or director, or which could reasonably be
expected to have any material liabilities or obligations (together, the
"PhotoMedex Benefit Plans"). The term PhotoMedex Benefit Plans also includes
all benefit plans subject to Title IV of ERISA in connection with which any
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a single
employer with PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries within the meaning of
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a "PhotoMedex ERISA Affiliate")
may have any liability.

  

  

(b) Other than as would not reasonably be expected to result in a PhotoMedex
Material Adverse Effect, (i) there has been no "prohibited transaction," as
such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, by
PhotoMedex or by any trusts created thereunder, any trustee or administrator
thereof or any other Person, with respect to any PhotoMedex Benefit Plan, (ii)

Plans that are subject to Title IV of ERISA, and (iv) all contributions and
premiums required to be made by PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex ERISA Affiliate
to any PhotoMedex Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due dates,
including any legally permitted extensions. Except with respect to claims for
benefits in the ordinary course, no Action has been brought, or to the
knowledge of PhotoMedex is threatened, against or with respect to any such
PhotoMedex Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS, United
States Department of Labor (the "DOL") or other Governmental Authority (other
than as would not reasonably be expected to result in a PhotoMedex Material
Adverse Effect). Each PhotoMedex Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and any
awards thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has been operated in good faith compliance, in all material respects, with
Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005. Each PhotoMedex Benefit Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the
subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS upon which the
sponsor of such PhotoMedex Benefit Plan is entitled to rely, has applied to
the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial
amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, or is maintained pursuant
to a volume submitter or prototype document for which it may properly rely on
the applicable advisory or opinion letter, and neither PhotoMedex nor any
PhotoMedex Subsidiary is aware of any circumstances that could result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the
qualification of such PhotoMedex Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code.

Plans, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any ancillary agreement related hereto to which PhotoMedex is a party, will
not, either alone or in combination with any other event or events, (i)
entitle any current or former employee, manager, director or consultant of
PhotoMedex or any of the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries to any payment of severance
pay, golden parachute payments, or bonuses, (ii) accelerate, forgive
indebtedness, vest, distribute, or increase benefits or obligation to fund
benefits with respect to any employee or director of PhotoMedex or any of the

with respect to any (i) employee pension benefit plan that is subject to Part
3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the

maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with their
terms and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, orders, decrees,
judgments, writs, and regulations of any controlling governmental authority or
instrumentality and all PhotoMedex Foreign Benefit Plans that are required to

3.15 Intellectual Property

  

  

. Section 3.15(a)(i) of the Radiancy Disclosure Letter contains a list of: (i)
all right, title and interest in and to all registered Intellectual Property
and Intellectual Property that is the subject of a pending application for
registration in each case that is, owned by Radiancy or any of the Radiancy

conducted ("Radiancy Intellectual Property"); and (ii) all material
Intellectual Property, other than as may be licensed pursuant to Off-the-Shelf
Software Agreements, that is licensed to Radiancy or any of the Radiancy
Subsidiaries and is material to the business of Radiancy ("Radiancy Licensed
Intellectual Property"). Except where failure to own, license or otherwise
possess such rights has not had and would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Radiancy Material Adverse Effect, each of Radiancy and the Radiancy
Subsidiaries (x) has all right, title and interest in and to Radiancy
Intellectual Property owned by it, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other
than rights and interest licensed to any other Person and Permitted
Encumbrances, and (y) has valid rights to use the Radiancy Licensed
Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in Section 3.15(a)(ii) of the
Radiancy Disclosure Letter, neither Radiancy nor any of the Radiancy
Subsidiaries has received any written notice alleging that it has infringed,
diluted or misappropriated, or, by conducting its business as currently
conducted, has infringed, diluted or misappropriated, the Intellectual
Property rights of any Person, and, except as set forth in Section
3.15(a)(iii) of the Radiancy Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of Radiancy,
there is no valid basis for any such allegation. Except as set forth in
Section 3.15(a)(iv) of the Radiancy Disclosure Letter, to Radiancy's knowledge
neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will materially impair or materially
alter Radiancy's or any Radiancy Subsidiary's rights to any Radiancy
Intellectual Property or Radiancy Licensed Intellectual Property. To
Radiancy's knowledge, all of Radiancy Intellectual Property and the license
rights to the Radiancy Licensed Intellectual Property are valid, enforceable
and subsisting

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

and, as of the date hereof, there is no material Action that is pending or, to
Radiancy's knowledge, threatened that challenges the rights of Radiancy or any
of the Radiancy Subsidiaries in any material respect of any Radiancy
Intellectual Property or Radiancy Licensed Intellectual Property or the
validity, enforceability or effectiveness thereof. Radiancy Intellectual
Property and the Radiancy Licensed Intellectual Property constitute all
material Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to Radiancy or the
Radiancy Subsidiaries and used in or necessary for the operation by Radiancy
and the Radiancy Subsidiaries of their respective businesses as currently
conducted. Neither Radiancy nor any of the Radiancy Subsidiaries is in breach
or default in any material respect (or would with the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both be in such breach or default) under any license to use
any of the Radiancy Licensed Intellectual Property, except for such breaches
and defaults which would not reasonably be expected to result in a Radiancy
Material Adverse Effect.

written or otherwise, as to which material unsatisfied liabilities or
obligations, contingent or otherwise, remain for the benefit of, or relating
to, any present or former employee, consultant, manager or director, or which

(together, the "Radiancy Benefit Plans"). The term Radiancy Benefit Plans also

which any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a
single employer with Radiancy and the Radiancy Subsidiaries within the meaning
of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a "Radiancy ERISA Affiliate")
may have any liability.

  

  

(b) Other than as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Radiancy
Material Adverse Effect, (i) there has been no "prohibited transaction," as
such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, by
Radiancy or by any trusts created thereunder, any trustee or administrator
thereof or any other Person, with respect to any Radiancy Benefit Plan, (ii)

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

no knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any of
Radiancy Benefit Plans that are subject to Title IV of ERISA, and (iv) all
contributions and premiums required to be made by Radiancy or any Radiancy
ERISA Affiliate to any Radiancy Benefit Plan have been made on or before their
due dates, including any legally permitted extensions. Except with respect to

the knowledge of Radiancy is threatened, against or with respect to any such
Radiancy Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS, the DOL or
other Governmental Authority (other than as would not reasonably be expected
to result in a Radiancy Material Adverse Effect). Each Radiancy Benefit Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and any awards thereunder, in each case that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, has been operated in good faith
compliance, in all material respects, with Section 409A of the Code since
January 1, 2005. Each Radiancy Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS upon which the sponsor of such Radiancy Benefit Plan is
entitled to rely, has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination
letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of
the Code, or is maintained pursuant to a volume submitter or prototype
document for which it may properly rely on the applicable advisory or opinion
letter, and neither Radiancy and nor any Radiancy Subsidiary is aware of any
circumstances that could result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such Radiancy Benefit
Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(c) of the Radiancy Disclosure Letter
or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any ancillary agreement related
hereto or as provided by applicable Law, with respect to Radiancy Benefit
Plans, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any ancillary agreement related hereto to which Radiancy is a party, will not,
either alone or in combination with any other event or events, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, manager, director or consultant of Radiancy or any
of the Radiancy Subsidiaries to any payment of severance pay, golden parachute
payments, or bonuses, (ii) accelerate, forgive indebtedness, vest, distribute,
or increase benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any
employee or director of Radiancy or any of the Radiancy Subsidiaries, or (iii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting of options to purchase securities of
Radiancy, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee,
director or consultant.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(d) of the Radiancy Disclosure Letter,
none of Radiancy Benefit Plans contains any provision requiring a gross-up
pursuant to Section 280G or 409A of the Code or similar Tax provisions.

  

  

(e) No Radiancy Benefit Plan maintained by Radiancy or any of the Radiancy
Subsidiaries provides material benefits, including death or medical benefits

(other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Laws, (ii) death benefits or
retirement benefits under any "employee pension benefit plan," as that term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, or (iii) benefits, the full direct cost of
which is borne by the current or former employee (or beneficiary thereof)).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(f) Neither Radiancy nor any Radiancy ERISA Affiliate has any liability with
respect to any (i) employee pension benefit plan that is subject to Part 3 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
(ii) "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or (iii)
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063 and 4064 of ERISA
or Section 413(c) of the Code.

  

  

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(g) of the Radiancy Disclosure Letter,
no Radiancy Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United
States (any such Radiancy Benefit Plan set forth in Section 3.16(g) of the
Radiancy Disclosure Letter, "Radiancy Foreign Benefit Plans"). All Radiancy
Foreign Benefit Plans have been established, maintained and administered in
compliance in all material respects with their terms and all applicable
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, orders, decrees, judgments, writs, and
regulations of any controlling governmental authority or instrumentality and
all Radiancy Foreign Benefit Plans that are required to be funded are fully
funded, and with respect to all other Radiancy Foreign Benefit Plans, adequate

hand, and PhotoMedex and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
respectively, and its respective Representatives, at reasonable times during
normal business hours and upon reasonable intervals and notice, and subject to
any confidentiality agreements with third Persons (the existence and scope of
which have been disclosed to the other Parties), access to all offices and
other facilities and to all employees, properties, contracts, agreements,
commitments, books and records, financial and operating data and other
information (including Tax Returns, internal working papers, client files,
client contracts and director service agreements), of or pertaining to such
Party and its subsidiaries, as the requesting Party or its Representatives may
reasonably request regarding such Party's business, assets, liabilities,

statement, each as they become available during the Executory Period, a copy
of each material report, schedule and other document filed with or received by
a Governmental Authority pursuant to the requirements of applicable securities
Laws, and independent public accountant's work papers (subject to the consent
or any other conditions required by such accountant, if any)) and instruct
such Party's Representatives to reasonably cooperate with the requesting Party
in its investigation; provided that the requesting Party shall conduct any
such activities in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of such Party providing such information; provided
further that in no event shall a Party have access to any information that (x)
based on advice of counsel, disclosure of such information (A) would violate
applicable Laws, including U.S. Antitrust Laws, or (B) violate any obligation
of such other Party with respect to confidentiality so long as, with respect
to confidentiality, such party has made reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver
regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom it owes an
obligation of confidentiality, or (y) in the reasonable judgment of the other
Party, could result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
and, in each such case, such Party shall only be entitled to withhold those
portions of such information which are subject to the foregoing limitations.
No information or knowledge obtained by any Party hereto pursuant to this
Section 4.2(a) will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
to consummate the Merger.

  

  

(b) All information obtained by PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary, on
the one hand, and Radiancy or any Radiancy Subsidiary, on the other hand,
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be kept confidential in
accordance with and subject to the reciprocal Confidentiality and Non-Use
Agreements, dated March 23, 2011, by and between Radiancy and PhotoMedex (the
"Confidentiality Agreements"). The Parties further acknowledge and agree that
the existence and terms of this Agreement and the Merger are strictly
confidential and that they and their respective officers, managers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, agents
or other representatives (collectively, the "Representatives") shall not
disclose to the public or to any third Person the terms of this Agreement and
the Merger other than with the express prior written consent of the other
Parties, except (i) as may be required by applicable Law or at the request of
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the such Party or any of
its Representatives, control persons or affiliates (including, without
limitation, to the extent applicable, the rules and regulations of the SEC and
FINRA), (ii) as required to carry out a Party's obligations hereunder, or
(iii) as may be required to defend any action brought against such Person in
connection with the Merger, and in the case of clause (iii), in accordance
with and subject the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreements.

  

  

4.3 No Solicitation; No Change in Recommendation.

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means (other than
the transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger) any inquiry, proposal, offer, plan, arrangement or any other
indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, from any Person or
group at any time relating to a merger, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series
of related transactions, involving (i) any of PhotoMedex and/or the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

PhotoMedex Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any third Person, on the other
hand, or any acquisition, purchase, sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer
or other acquisition or disposition involving twenty percent (20%) or more of
PhotoMedex's and/or the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries' assets or business, or any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in a third party beneficially owning twenty percent
(20%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of PhotoMedex, or
(ii) any of Radiancy and/or the Radiancy Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any third Person, on the other hand, or any acquisition, purchase, sale,
lease, license, exchange, transfer or other acquisition or disposition
involving twenty percent (20%) or more of Radiancy's and/or the Radiancy
Subsidiaries' assets or business, or any tender offer (including a self-tender
offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a third party
beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of Radiancy.

  

  

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.3, during the Executory
Period neither PhotoMedex nor any PhotoMedex Subsidiary, on the one hand, nor
Radiancy or any Radiancy Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall, directly or
indirectly, authorize or permit any of its respective Representatives to, (i)
solicit, assist, initiate or facilitate the making, submission or announcement
of, or intentionally encourage, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any
non-public information regarding PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary, on
the one hand, or Radiancy or any Radiancy Subsidiary, on the other hand, to
any Person or group (other than a Party to this Agreement or their respective
Representatives) in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person or
group with respect to, or that could be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) withdraw or propose publicly to withdraw the approval of this
Agreement or the Merger or the PhotoMedex Board's, the Merger Sub Board's or
the Radiancy Board's (or any respective committees of any of such Boards),
respective recommendation that holders of such Party's voting equity
securities adopt this Agreement (with respect to PhotoMedex, such
recommendation being the "PhotoMedex Board Recommendation", and with respect
to Radiancy, such recommendation being the "Radiancy Board Recommendation"),
(v) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (vi) negotiate or enter into any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) agree to do any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that prior to the meeting of the PhotoMedex
Stockholders or the meeting of the Radiancy Stockholders, each as contemplated
by Section 5.5 hereof, as the case may be, this Section 4.3(b) shall not
prohibit PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as the case may be, from furnishing nonpublic
information regarding PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as applicable, to, or entering
into discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response to an
Acquisition Proposal made by such Person (and not withdrawn) that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to result in the submission by such Person to
PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as applicable, of a Superior Proposal if: (1) neither
PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as the case may be, nor any of their Representatives
or their Subsidiaries' Representatives shall have breached any of the
provisions of this Section 4.3, (2) the PhotoMedex Board or the Radiancy
Board, as the case may be, determines in good faith and after consultation
with outside legal counsel that, in light of such Superior Proposal, not
taking such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
PhotoMedex Board or the Radiancy Board, as the case may be, to the
stockholders of PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as the case

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

may be, under applicable Law, (3) PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as the case may be,
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
provisions (including non-disclosure provisions) that are at least as
favorable to PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as the case may be, as the provisions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreements, and (4) PhotoMedex or Radiancy,
as the case may be, shall provide the other with notice and information as are
required to be provided by it pursuant to Section 4.3(c) hereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of PhotoMedex and Radiancy agrees that it shall
be responsible for the actions of its and the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries'
Representatives or the Radiancy Subsidiaries' Representatives, as the case may
be, that would constitute a violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 4.3 if done by such Person. PhotoMedex and Radiancy shall promptly
inform their respective Representatives and PhotoMedex Subsidiaries'
Representatives and Radiancy Subsidiaries' Representatives, as the case may
be, of the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.3.

  

  

(c) Each of PhotoMedex and Radiancy shall notify the other hereto as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) orally and in writing of the
receipt by PhotoMedex, the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, on one hand, or Radiancy, the Radiancy Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives, on the other hand, of (i) any bona fide
inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests for
discussions or negotiations regarding or constituting any Acquisition Proposal
or any bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or
requests for discussions or negotiations that could be expected to result in
an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary or Radiancy or any
Radiancy Subsidiary, as applicable, specifying in each case the material terms
and conditions thereof (including a copy thereof if in writing or a written
summary thereof if verbal) and the identity of the party making such inquiry,
proposal, offer or request for information. PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as
applicable, shall keep the other Party hereto promptly informed of the status
of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for information. During
the Executory Period, PhotoMedex and Radiancy shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall direct, and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause, PhotoMedex's
Representatives, the PhotoMedex Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives, on one hand, and Radiancy's Representatives, the Radiancy
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, on the other hand, to cease
and terminate any such solicitations, discussions or negotiations.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.3 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the time that the PhotoMedex Stockholder Approval is obtained, if
PhotoMedex receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal which the PhotoMedex
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal that was made
after the date hereof and that did not result from a breach of this Section
4.3 by PhotoMedex, the PhotoMedex Board may, if it determines in good faith
and after consultation with outside legal counsel that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, not taking such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the PhotoMedex Board to its stockholders under applicable
Law, the PhotoMedex Board may withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose
to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Radiancy, the approval
or recommendation by such board or committee of the adoption of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
effectuation of the Merger

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(a "PhotoMedex Change of Board Recommendation"), and approve or recommend such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that PhotoMedex shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a PhotoMedex Change of Board Recommendation
pursuant to this sentence unless PhotoMedex has: (A) provided Radiancy five
(5) Business Days' prior written notice (such notice, a "PhotoMedex Notice of
Superior Proposal"), which notice shall not be deemed to be a PhotoMedex
Change of Board Recommendation, advising Radiancy that the PhotoMedex Board
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the
then current material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action by the PhotoMedex Board and the identity of
the Person making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any material amendment to any other
material term of any such Superior Proposal shall require a new PhotoMedex
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three (3) Business Day period), (B)
during the applicable notice period, if requested by Radiancy, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Radiancy to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
any Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of the applicable
notice period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Radiancy following a PhotoMedex Notice of
Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required by clause (A) or
otherwise).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.3 to the contrary, at any prior
to the time that the Radiancy Stockholder Approval is obtained, if Radiancy
receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal which the Radiancy Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal that was made after the date hereof
and that did not result from a breach of this Section 4.3 by Radiancy, the
Radiancy Board may, if it determines in good faith and after consultation with
outside legal counsel that, in light of such Superior Proposal, not taking
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Radiancy
Board to its stockholders under applicable Law, the Radiancy Board may
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to PhotoMedex, the approval or recommendation by
such board or committee of the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the effectuation of the
Merger (a "Radiancy Change of Board Recommendation"), and approve or recommend
such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that Radiancy shall not be entitled
to exercise its right to make a Radiancy Change of Board Recommendation
pursuant to this sentence unless Radiancy has: (A) provided PhotoMedex five
(5) Business Days' prior written notice (such notice, a "Radiancy Notice of
Superior Proposal"), which notice shall not be deemed to be a Radiancy Change
of Board Recommendation, advising PhotoMedex that the Radiancy Board intends
to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the then
current material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action by the Radiancy Board and the identity of the
Person making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of
any such Superior Proposal shall require a new Radiancy Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new three (3) Business Day period), (B) during the applicable
notice period, if requested by PhotoMedex, engaged in good faith negotiations
with PhotoMedex to amend this Agreement in

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

such a manner that any Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute
a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of the
applicable notice period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by PhotoMedex following a Radiancy
Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required by
clause (A) or otherwise).

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to prohibit PhotoMedex from
complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith
judgment of the PhotoMedex Board, after receiving advice from its outside
legal counsel, failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law. In addition, it is understood and
agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public
statement by PhotoMedex that merely describes PhotoMedex's receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto,
any statement to the effect that PhotoMedex is discussing or evaluating such
Acquisition Proposal, or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the
PhotoMedex Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar
communication to PhotoMedex's Stockholders, shall not constitute a PhotoMedex
Change of Board Recommendation.

  

  

(g) For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified) on terms which the PhotoMedex Board or Radiancy
Board, as applicable, has determined in its good faith judgment are more
favorable to the stockholders of PhotoMedex or Radiancy, as applicable, if
consummated in accordance with its terms from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, after consultation with its
respective legal counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account
all legal, financial (including the financing terms of such proposal),
regulatory, conditions to consummation, timing and other aspects of such
proposal and this Agreement (taking into account any modifications to this
Agreement that the other Party proposes to make), and taking into account the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the likelihood of
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that for
purposes of this definition, the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"fifty percent (50%)."

  

  

4.4 Payment to Perseus.

  

  

(a) Contemporaneously with the Closing (or at such other time and upon such
terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties), Radiancy
agrees to provide, from its available cash, to PhotoMedex an aggregate amount
as shall be sufficient to allow PhotoMedex to satisfy in full its payment
obligation under that certain Repurchase Right Agreement, dated as of May 27,
2011 (the "Repurchase Right Agreement"), by and between PhotoMedex and Perseus
Partners VII, L.P. ("Perseus"). The Parties hereby agree that any payments to
be made pursuant to this Section 4.4 may be made by Radiancy, in its sole
discretion, directly to Perseus.

  

  

(b) The payment described in Section 4.4(a) above shall exclusively be

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 

used to satisfy the obligations of PhotoMedex to Perseus in accordance with
the terms of the Repurchase Right Agreement and the satisfaction of the
foregoing obligations to Perseus (the "Repurchase Transaction") shall be a
condition to the Closing of this Agreement.

  

  

4.5 Disclosure Updates

  

  

.

  

  

(a) PhotoMedex and Radiancy shall each have, upon written notice to the other
Party hereto (a "New Disclosure Notice"), the right at any time after the date
of this Agreement, until that date which is two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, to amend the PhotoMedex Disclosure Letter or Radiancy Disclosure
Letter, as the case may be, to reflect any new disclosure information not set
forth in such letter as of the date of this Agreement; provided, that any such
new disclosure information does not reflect facts, circumstances or events
that would reasonably be expected to result in a PhotoMedex Material Adverse
Effect or a Radiancy Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. In the event
that any such new disclosure information reflects facts, circumstances or
events that would reasonably be expected to result in a PhotoMedex Material
Adverse Effect or a Radiancy Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, a
Party may notify the other Party in writing of its election to reject the
inclusion of such new disclosure information in the applicable disclosure
letter within two (2) Business Days of receipt of the New Disclosure Notice (a
"Disclosure Rejection Notice"), in which case such new disclosure information
shall not be included in the PhotoMedex Disclosure Letter or the Radiancy
Disclosure Letter, as the case may be. Failure by a Party to reject such new
disclosure information within such two (2) Business Day period shall be deemed
an acceptance by a Party of such new disclosure information in the PhotoMedex
Disclosure Letter or Radiancy Disclosure Letter, as the case may be.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.5(a) above, no new disclosure
information contained in a New Disclosure Notice shall be deemed to cure any
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement, provided,
however, that any update of information in the PhotoMedex Disclosure Letter or
the Radiancy Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall not be deemed to be
a breach of any representation or warranty for any purpose under this
Agreement, including the indemnity obligations under Section 5.18 of this
Agreement, so long as such update reflects actions which are permitted to be
taken pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement.

applicable, or any of their affiliates with respect to the consummation of the

admission by the Party providing notice regarding whether or not any of the
conditions to Closing or to the consummation of the Merger have been satisfied
or in determining whether or not any of the representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement have been breached. Moreover, no
information or knowledge obtained by any Party hereto pursuant to this Section

contained in Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b), if any objections are asserted

or any other applicable Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority
or any private Person challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
as violative of any Antitrust Law or any other applicable Law or which would
otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Radiancy, PhotoMedex and Merger
Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(d) For purposes of Section 5.2(c), "commercially reasonable efforts" shall
not include nor require any Party or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) propose,
negotiate, or offer to commit or agree to or effect by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, disposition or
hold separate of any asset, in each case if such sale, divestiture, license,
disposition or hold separate with respect thereto would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a PhotoMedex Material Adverse
Effect or a Radiancy Material Adverse Effect (after giving effect to the
Merger), as the case may be, or (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business
in any particular manner if such conduct or agreement with respect thereto
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
PhotoMedex Material Adverse Effect or a Radiancy Material Adverse Effect
(after giving effect to the Merger), as the case may be. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither PhotoMedex, Radiancy, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall propose, negotiate or offer to commit to
any sale, divestiture, license, disposition or hold separate of any asset
contemplated to be held by the Surviving Company following the consummation of
the Merger without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

other and use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the expiration
of the Executory Period, PhotoMedex shall use its commercially reasonable

contemplated hereby.

PhotoMedex shall be required to agree to any commercially unreasonable consent
fee, term, condition or modification with respect to obtaining any Consents or
Requisite Regulatory Approvals in connection with the Merger and consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required
by applicable Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
under applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of PhotoMedex.

stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement,

respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority, including, without
limitation, FINRA, in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Each of Radiancy and PhotoMedex shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or from FINRA, that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite approval will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially
delayed, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall promptly
provide the other Party with a copy of such communication.

effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder during the term
thereof.

  

  

(d) In the event the execution of this Agreement or the undertaking of any act
or omission by PhotoMedex required by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date
causes any insurance policy, in place for the benefit of any PhotoMedex or
PhotoMedex Subsidiary Covered Persons immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, to terminate or causes any reduction in the benefits of such

and/or Merger Sub of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any representation

of a condition set forth in Section 6.3 (a "Terminating Radiancy Breach");

Radiancy prior to the Drop

Dead, then PhotoMedex may not terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(d) for fourteen (14) calendar days after delivery of written notice from
PhotoMedex to Radiancy of such Terminating Radiancy Breach, provided Radiancy
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such Terminating
Radiancy Breach (it being understood that PhotoMedex may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) if it shall have materially breached
this Agreement or if such Terminating Radiancy Breach by Radiancy is cured
during such fourteen (14) calendar day period);

  

  

(e) by written notice by Radiancy if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the Drop Dead Date; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available
to Radiancy if Radiancy or any Radiancy Subsidiary is in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, or materially fails to fulfill any of its respective obligations
under this Agreement, which, in any such case, results in, or otherwise
causes, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before the Drop Dead
Date;

  

  

(f) by written notice by PhotoMedex if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the Drop Dead Date; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available
to PhotoMedex if PhotoMedex or any PhotoMedex Subsidiary is in material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, or materially fails to fulfill any of its respective obligations
under this Agreement, which, in any such case, results in, or otherwise
causes, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before the Drop Dead

successors and assigns, the "Company"), hereby certifies that [_____________]
is entitled to subscribe for and purchase, during the Term (as hereinafter
defined), up to [_____] ([_____]) shares (subject to adjustment as hereinafter
provided) of the duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), at an exercise price per share equal to the Warrant Price then in
effect, subject, however, to the provisions and upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth in this Warrant.

  

  

1. Term

  

  

The term of this Warrant shall commence on [___________ __], 2011 (the "Date
of Issuance") and shall expire at 6:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the earlier of:
(i) the date that is three years after the date of issuance hereof, or (ii)
the Expiration Date (as defined below) (such period being the "Term").

  

  

2. Method of Exercise; Payment; Issuance of New Warrant

  

  

  

  

(a) Time of Exercise. The purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be
exercised in whole or in part during the Term beginning on the date of
issuance hereof.

  

  

(b) Method of Exercise. The Holder hereof may exercise this Warrant, in whole
or in part, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the exercise form attached
hereto duly executed) at the principal office of the Company, and by the
payment to the Company of an amount of consideration therefor equal to the
Warrant Price in effect on the date of such exercise multiplied by the number
of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is then being exercised,
payable at such Holder's election by certified or official bank check or by
wire

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

  

transfer to an account designated by the Company; provided, that any partial
exercise of this Warrant shall be an exercise for a number of Warrant Shares
that is not less than the lesser of (i) one hundred 100 Warrant Shares or (ii)
the total number of Warrant Shares underlying this Warrant. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this Warrant on a
cashless basis.

  

  

(c) Issuance of Stock Certificates. In the event of any exercise of this
Warrant in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
certificates for the Warrant Shares so purchased shall be dated the date the
Company has received this Warrant and the payment of the Warrant Price for the
Warrant Shares with respect to this Warrant (the "Exercise Date") and
delivered to the Holder hereof within a reasonable time, not exceeding three
(3) Trading Days after such exercise (the "Delivery Date"). The Common Stock
issued upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to be issued to the
Holder as the record owner of such shares as of the close of business on the
Exercise Date. The Holder shall deliver this original Warrant, or an
indemnification undertaking with respect to such Warrant in the case of its
loss, theft or destruction, at such time that this Warrant is fully exercised.
With respect to partial exercises of this Warrant, the Company shall keep
written records for the Holder of the number of Warrant Shares exercised as of
each date of exercise.

  

  

(d) Non-Transferability of Warrant. This Warrant may not be transferred or
assigned, either in whole or in part, except for transfers to an Affiliate if
the Holder is an entity, or if the Holder is an individual, to such Holder's
spouse, children (whether natural, step or by adoption), grandchildren
(whether natural, step or by adoption) or parents (collectively, "Permitted
Transferees") or to a trust, partnership or limited liability company solely
for the benefit of one or more of any of such Holder or its Permitted
Transferees. Any such transferee or assignee must agree to be bound by the
terms of this Warrant in order for such transfer or assignment to be
effective.

  

  

(e) Automatic Expiration. If at any time after the Date of Issuance the Market
Price for the Common Stock exceeds $30.00 per share (subject to adjustment for
reverse and forward stock splits, stock combinations and other similar
transactions of the Common Stock that occur after the date hereof) over the
course of any twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days (the occurrence of such
event, a "Threshold Event"), then the Company may, at any time following the
occurrence of such Threshold Event, provide notice to the Holder (an
"Expiration Notice"), at the address of the Holder recorded in the Company's
books, indicating that the Warrant shall expire on the expiration date set
forth in the Expiration Notice (the "Expiration Date"), which date shall not
be earlier than twenty (20) Trading Days following the date upon which the
Company delivers such Expiration Notice to the Holder, after which, all rights
of the Holder under this Warrant shall terminate.

  

  

(f) The term "Market Price" on any date shall be deemed to be, for such date,
the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a)
if the Common Stock is listed or quoted on an Eligible Market (other than the
OTC Bulletin Board or Pink Sheets), the closing trading price of the Common
Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the Eligible Market as
reported by Bloomberg Financial L.P. (based on a Trading Day from 9:30 a.m.
Eastern Time to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time); (b) if the Common Stock is then
listed or quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the closing trading price of the
Common Stock for such date (or the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

  

nearest preceding date) on the OTC Bulletin Board; (c) if the Common Stock is
not then listed or quoted on an Eligible Market and if prices for the Common
Stock are then reported in the Pink Sheets published by Pink Sheets, LLC (or a
similar organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting
prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported;
or (d) if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted on an Eligible Market,
the OTC Bulletin Board or in the Pink Sheets, the price determined by an
appraiser selected by the holders of a majority in interest of the Warrant
Shares and reasonably acceptable to the Company.

  

  

3. Stock Fully Paid; Reservation and Listing of Shares; Covenants.

  

  

(a) Stock Fully Paid. The Company represents, warrants, covenants and agrees
that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant
or otherwise hereunder will, when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Warrant, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
free from all taxes, liens and charges created by or through the Company. The
Company further covenants and agrees that during the period within which this
Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized and
reserved for the purpose of the issuance upon exercise of this Warrant a
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock equal to at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant without regard to any limitations on exercise.

  

  

(b) Loss, Theft, Destruction of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence
satisfactory to the Company of the ownership of and the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Warrant and, in the case of any such loss,
theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity or security satisfactory to
the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and
cancellation of such Warrant, the Company will make and deliver, in lieu of
such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor
and representing the right to purchase the same number of shares of Common
Stock.

  

  

(c) Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay any documentary stamp and similar
taxes attributable to the issuance of the Warrant Shares issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant.

  

  

4. Adjustment of Warrant Price and Number of Shares Issuable Upon Exercise

  

  

(a) . The Warrant Price and the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise
of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the
occurrence of certain events described in this Section 4. Upon each adjustment
of the Warrant Price, the Holder of this Warrant shall thereafter be entitled
to purchase, at the Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment, the number
of shares obtained by multiplying the Warrant Price in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment by the number of shares purchasable pursuant hereto
immediately prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the
Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment.

  

  

(a) Stock Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant
is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or
distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity-
equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock
split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or
(iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of
capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Warrant Price shall be
multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which the
denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise
of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted. Any adjustment made
pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the
effective date of such stock dividend, subdivision or combination.

  


 

  

(b) Calculations. All calculations under this Section 4 shall be made to the
nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For
purposes of this Section 4, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be
issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.

  

  

5. Notice of Adjustments

  

  

(a) . Whenever the Warrant Price or Warrant Share Number shall be adjusted
pursuant to Section 4 hereof (for purposes of this Section 5, each an
"adjustment"), the Company shall prepare a certificate signed by an officer of
the Company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the
adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment
was calculated, and the Warrant Price and Warrant Share Number after giving
effect to such adjustment, and shall cause copies of such certificate to be
mailed (by certified or registered mail, return receipt required, postage
prepaid) within thirty (30) days of such adjustment to the Holder of this
Warrant at the address of such Holder recorded in the Company's books.

  

  

6. Fractional Shares

  

  

No fractional Warrant Shares will be issued in connection with any exercise
hereof, but in lieu of such fractional shares, the Company shall round the
number of shares to be issued upon exercise up to the nearest whole number of
shares, except if a Holder is entitled to receive an amount of Warrant Shares
that is less than one (1), in which case the Company shall have the option of
purchasing the Warrant from the Holder for the pro rata Warrant Price for such
fractional share.
