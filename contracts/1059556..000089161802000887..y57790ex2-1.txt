"Notice of Disagreement") to Parent setting forth in reasonable detail the

in this Section 3.2.4, the Member Representative and the Members shall be
deemed to have accepted such Adjustment Amount Documents in the form
delivered to them by Parent.    20     (c) If Parent does not dispute

referred to the Independent Accounting Firm for a resolution of such
Disagreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The
determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to any
Disagreement shall be rendered within fifteen (15) Business Days
after referral of the Disagreement to the Independent Accounting Firm or as
soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, shall be final and binding upon
the parties, the amount so determined shall be used to complete the final
Adjustment Amount Documents and the parties agree that the procedures set

Independent Accounting Firm retained pursuant to this Section 3.2.4(d) shall
be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Principal Members and the KMV
Corporation Shareholders. Parent shall be entitled but not required to deduct
from the Working/Cash Capital Holdback Amount any such fees to be paid by the

shall pay to the Independent Accounting Firm.   (e) Promptly after the
Adjustment Amount Documents have been finally determined in accordance with
this Section 3.2.4 (including by means of a deemed acceptance of such
documents by Parent or the Member Representative as provided in Section
3.2.4(b) and (c), respectively), but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days following such final determination (the "Supplemental Closing Date"),
the parties hereto shall hold a supplemental closing (the
"Supplemental Closing"), either by telephone or in person at a mutually
convenient location. If the Differential is a negative number Parent shall

Closing Date an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of such
Differential, which deducted amount Parent shall be entitled to retain and
(ii) deliver each Member\'s and KMV Corporation Shareholder\'s portion, pro
rata in accordance with their respective ownership percentages set forth on
the Closing Consideration Exhibit, of the remainder of the Working/Cash
Capital Holdback Amount, if any, as set forth in instructions from the Member
Representative. If such Differential exceeds the Working/Cash Capital
Holdback Amount, then such excess shall be deemed to be Losses pursuant to
Section 10.2 of this Agreement; provided, however, that such Losses shall not
be subject to the Threshold Amount but rather Parent shall be immediately
entitled to offset pursuant to Section 10.2.3 of    21    this
Agreement to the full extent of such Losses and recover such
amounts immediately from the Escrow Account. If the Differential is a
positive number, Parent shall (x) deliver each Member\'s and KMV Corporation
Shareholder\'s portion, pro rata in accordance with their respective
ownership percentages set forth on the Closing Consideration Exhibit, of the
Working/Cash Capital Holdback Amount (less any amounts deducted from the

of Section 3.2.4(d) of this Agreement to pay the Principal Members\' and KMV
Corporation Shareholders\' 50% share of the fees of the Independent
Accounting Firm) as set forth in instructions from the Member Representative
and (y) deliver each Member\'s and KMV Corporation Shareholder\'s portion,
pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership percentages set forth

Representative.   Section 3.3 Payment for Company Units and KMV Corporation
Shares.   (a) Payments. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall remit to
each Member (other than KMV Corporation) and KMV Corporation Shareholder
in immediately available funds the amount of the Transaction Consideration
due to such Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder, less the applicable
portion of the Escrow Funds, if applicable, and Working/Cash Capital
Holdback, all in accordance with the Closing Consideration Exhibit, by wire
transfer to such respective account as such Member or KMV Corporation
Shareholder shall have notified to Parent for such purpose at least seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and otherwise by mailing a check in
such amount to their respective addresses set forth on the Closing
Consideration Exhibit (or such other address furnished by the Principal
Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders to the Parent in writing at
least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), provided, however
that each Member and KMV Corporation Shareholder shall have furnished a W-9
or W-8 (if applicable) and, in the case of KMV Corporation Shareholders, each
such KMV Corporation Shareholder shall have delivered to Parent at the
Closing (x) the certificate(s) evidencing its KMV Corporation Shares duly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank, in
such form as is reasonably acceptable to Parent, or (y) such duly executed
assignment and indemnification agreements in connection with any lost,
destroyed or mutilated certificate(s) as may be reasonably required by Parent
in connection with any KMV Corporation Shareholder whose certificate(s) for
KMV Corporation Shares have been lost, destroyed or mutilated. Any KMV
Corporation Shares that are not so surrendered and purchased at the Closing
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the cash to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Section 3.3 of this Agreement, promptly upon
surrender of the foregoing documents to the Parent. The Parent\'s obligations
with respect to any KMV Corporation Shares that are not so surrendered at the
Closing shall be subject to the effect of abandoned property, escheat or
similar applicable laws, and neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall
be liable to any holder of KMV Corporation Shares in respect of payments due
hereunder that are delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.   (b) Withholding. Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Units or KMV Corporation
Shares such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to
the making of such    22    payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Units or KMV
Corporation Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, and Parent shall provide receipts or similar evidence of such
withholding to such holders of Company Units and KMV Corporation Shares, as
applicable.   ARTICLE 4.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND

Undisclosed Liabilities.   Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth true and correct copies of (i) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Combined Company as of December 31, 2000 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in owners\' equity and cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 2000; (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Combined Company as of December 31, 1999 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in owners\' equity and cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 1999; (iii) the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Combined Company as of December 31, 2001 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in owners\' equity and cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 2001; and (iv) a schedule of the deferred
revenue of the Combined Company as of January 31, 2002 that indicates new
sales, cancellations, revenue earned and ending balance by client since
December 31, 2001 (the statements referred to in the foregoing clauses
(i) through    28    (iv), the "Company Financial Statements" and the
unaudited balance sheet as of December 31, 2001, the "Company Balance
Sheet"). The Company Financial Statements (including the related notes
thereto, where applicable) present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Combined Company and the results of
the Combined Company\'s consolidated operations and cash flows for the fiscal
periods therein set forth in accordance with GAAP with respect thereto
(except as indicated in the related notes thereto, if any), and are
consistent with the books and records of the Combined Company (except as
indicated in the related notes thereto, if any). The accounts receivable
reflected in the Company Financial Statements and all accounts receivable
arising since December 31, 2001 represent bona fide claims against debtors
for sales, services performed or other charges invoiced on or before
the Closing Date. As of December 31, 2001, the accounts receivable reflected
in the Company Financial Statements are collectible in the normal course of
business and, therefore, no reserve for uncollectible accounts was necessary
as of December 31, 2001 and therefore none is reflected in the 2001
Financial Statements, provided that the foregoing does not constitute a
guaranty of the collectibility of such accounts receivable. The Combined
Company does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due,
which are of a type that would be required to be shown on an audited balance
sheet (or described in the notes thereto) prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except for (x) liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on
the Company Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes related thereto, and (y)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the Company Balance Sheet and which are not
material, taken as a whole.   Section 4.7 Contracts. Except for those
Contracts listed in Section 4.8, Section 4.9 and Section 4.15 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list or description, as of the date of this
Agreement, of all Contracts: (s) that are between the Company, KMV
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Person listed on Exhibit E hereto or any Person who, to the Combined
Company\'s Knowledge is a Subsidiary of any Person listed on Exhibit E on the
other hand, (t) which constitute Contracts with current clients or

nondisclosure agreements or confidentiality agreements which could reasonably
be expected to have a significant effect on the conduct of the Company
Business or the business of Parent; (v) pursuant to which the Company, KMV
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries are either obligated to
pay or entitled to receive in excess of $25,000 in any year that is not
otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to subsections (t), (u), (w),
(x), (y) or (z) of this Section 4.7; provided, however, that Section 4.7 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule does not omit any Contracts pursuant to
which, when viewed collectively, the Company, KMV Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries are either obligated to pay or entitled to receive in
excess of $1,500,000 in any year in the aggregate; (w) that constitute joint
venture or outbound third-party redistribution arrangements which are not
terminable by the Company, KMV Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries within ninety (90) days from the date of this Agreement without
penalty or further obligation on the part of the Company, KMV Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries; (x) involve payments based on profits
or revenues of the Company, KMV Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; (y) are employment, management, consulting or
severance agreements with any of the current Company Employees or current
Company Independent Contractors or (z) include any noncompetition or
nonsolicitation covenant or any exclusive dealing or similar arrangement
that    29    limits the ability of the Company, KMV Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to compete (geographically or otherwise) in
any line of business or which would so limit the Surviving Company or Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Scheduled Contracts"). As of the date hereof, each of the
Contracts is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, KMV
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto) and is in full force and
effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally and
by the availability of equitable remedies (whether in proceedings at law or
in equity). As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company,
KMV Corporation nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has received written
notice of cancellation of or default under or intent to cancel or call a
default under any of the Contracts nor, to the Knowledge of the Company
Group, has the Company, KMV Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries received verbal notice of cancellation of or default under any
of the Contracts. The Company, KMV Corporation and each of their respective
Subsidiaries have performed all significant obligations (individually or in
the aggregate) required to be performed by it prior to the Closing under the
Contracts, and assuming receipt of the consents and approvals set forth in
Section 4.4 and 4.8.10 hereof, there exists no event or condition which with
or without notice or lapse of time or both would be a breach or a default of
such significant obligations (individually or in the aggregate) on the part
of the Company, KMV Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or,
to the Knowledge of the Company Group, on the part of the other party to such
Contracts, other than such breaches and defaults that are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 4.8 Intellectual Property Matters.   Section 4.8.1

use and incontestability and renewal applications) other than any requirement
that, if not satisfied, would not result in a cancellation of any such
registration or otherwise affect the use, priority or enforceability of
the Trademark in question. No registered Company Owned Trademark has been or
is now involved in any opposition or cancellation proceeding in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or any    30    comparable foreign
agency. No such action has been threatened in writing, or to the Knowledge of
the Company Group, orally. To the Knowledge of the Company Group, there has
been no prior use of any Company Trademark by any third party that confers
upon said third party rights in any such Trademark.   Section 4.8.2.2 The
Company is the owner of all right, title and interest in and to all of the
Company Owned Trademarks, in each case free and clear of any and all
Encumbrances, covenants, conditions and restrictions or other adverse claims
or interests of any kind or nature, and the Combined Company has not received
any written notice or claim or, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, any
oral notice or claim, challenging the Company\'s complete and exclusive
ownership of the Company Owned Trademarks or suggesting that any other Person
has any claim of legal or beneficial ownership with respect thereto. There is
no agreement, decree, arbitral award or other provision or contingency which
obligates the Company Group to grant licenses in future Trademarks. No such
action has been threatened in writing or, to the Company Group\'s
Knowledge, orally. To the Knowledge of the Company Group, no circumstances
exist which could give rise to such a threat or action.   Section 4.8.2.3
To the Company Group\'s Knowledge, no other Person uses any Trademark that is
the same as or confusingly similar to a Company Owned Trademark. The Company
Group has not taken any action or failed to take any action or used or
enforced any Company Owned Trademark in any manner that would result in the
abandonment or unenforceability of any Company Owned Trademark.   Section
4.8.3 Patents.   Section 4.8.3.1 All Company Patents are currently in
compliance with all Applicable Law (including payment of filing, examination,
and maintenance fees and proofs of working or use) and the Company Group has
not taken any action or failed to take any action (including a failure to
disclose prior art in connection with the prosecution of any Patent), or used
or enforced (or failed to use or enforce) any of the Company Patents in a
manner that would result in the abandonment or unenforceability of any of the
Company Patents.   Section 4.8.3.2 No Company Patent has been or is now
involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination or opposition proceeding
in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any foreign patent
office. No such action has been threatened in writing, or to the Knowledge of
the Company Group, orally and, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, no
circumstances exist which could give rise to such a threat.   Section
4.8.3.3 To the Knowledge of the Company Group, there is no Patent of any
Person that claims the same subject matter as any Company Patent or any other
Patent licensed to the Combined Company (and its predecessors in interest) or
otherwise used in the Company Business and no prior art invalidates any claim
of any Company Patent.   Section 4.8.3.4 The Company is the owner of all
right, title and interest in and to all of the Company Patents, in each case
free and clear of any and all Encumbrances, covenants, conditions and
restrictions or other adverse claims or interests of any kind or nature, and
the Company Group has not received any notice or claim (whether written   
31    or, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, oral) challenging the
Combined Company\'s complete and exclusive ownership of the Company Patents
or suggesting that any other Person has any claim of legal or beneficial
ownership with respect thereto. There is no agreement, decree, arbitral award
or other provision or contingency which obligates the Combined Company to
grant licenses in future Patents. No such action has been threatened in
writing or, to the Company Group\'s Knowledge, orally and, to the Knowledge
of the Company Group, no circumstances exist which could give rise to such a
threat.   Section 4.8.3.5 The Inventions disclosed in the Company
Patents may be practiced by the Company without infringing any other Patents
or other Intellectual Property Rights owned by any Person and, to the
Knowledge of the Company Group, there are no circumstances or facts that
would give rise to any claim of Infringement, provided that the foregoing
"Knowledge of the Company Group" qualification shall not apply where such an
Infringement would, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material impact
upon the Company Business.   Section 4.8.3.6 The Company Group has not
granted to any Person any right, license or permission to practice any of the
Inventions claimed in the Company Patents.   Section 4.8.4 Copyrights and
Moral Rights.   Section 4.8.4.1 The Company is the owner of all right, title
and interest in and to each of the Company Owned Copyrights, free and clear
of any and all Encumbrances, covenants, conditions and restrictions or other
adverse claims or interests of any kind or nature, and each member of the
Combined Company has the right to use all Company Licensed Copyrights as used
in the operation of the Company Business and shall continue to have such
rights after the Closing on the same terms and conditions as in existence
prior to the Closing. The Company Group has not received any notice or claim
(whether written or, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, oral) challenging
the Combined Company\'s complete and exclusive ownership of the Company Owned
Copyrights or right to use all Company Licensed Copyrights used in the
operation of the Company Business or claiming that any other Person has any
claim of legal or beneficial ownership with respect thereto.   Section
4.8.4.2 The Company Group has not received any written notice or claim
challenging or questioning the validity or enforceability of any of the
Company Copyrights or threatening on the part of any Person to bring a claim
that any Company Copyright is invalid, is unenforceable or has been misused.
To the Knowledge of the Company Group, the Company Group has not received any
oral notice or claim specifically challenging or questioning the validity or
enforceability of any of the Company Copyrights. No circumstances exist which
could give rise to a challenge or threat to any Company Copyright that is
significant to the operation of the Company Business.   Section 4.8.4.3 The
Company Group has not taken any action, or failed to take any action
(including a failure to disclose required information to the United States
Copyright Office or any comparable foreign agency in connection with a
registered Company Owned Copyright), or used or enforced (or failed to use or
enforce) any of the Company Owned    32    Copyrights, in each case in
a manner that would result in the unenforceability of any of the Company
Owned Copyrights. The Company has taken all reasonable steps to protect the
Company Group\'s rights in and to the Company Owned Copyrights. To the
Knowledge of the Company Group, no other Person has infringed or is
infringing in any significant respect any of the Company Copyrights.  
Section 4.8.4.4 No Moral Rights have been claimed (whether written or, to the
Knowledge of the Company Group, oral) in relation to any Company Copyrights
and/or other Company IP. All Moral Rights in relation to Company Owned IP
have been waived by the respective owners thereof.   Section 4.8.5 Trade
Secrets.   Section 4.8.5.1 The Company is the owner of all right, title
and interest in and to all of the Tier 1 Trade Secrets, and, to the Knowledge

and all Encumbrances, covenants, conditions and restrictions or other adverse
claims or interests of any kind or nature, and the Company Group has not
received any notice or claim (whether written or, to the Knowledge of the
Company Group, oral) challenging the Combined Company\'s complete and
exclusive ownership of the Tier 1 Trade Secrets or Tier 2 Trade Secrets, or
suggesting that any other Person has any claim of legal or beneficial
ownership with respect thereto, provided that this representation is true and
correct without regard to Knowledge where non-ownership of Tier 2 Trade
Secrets would, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material impact upon
the Company Business.   Section 4.8.5.2 The Company Group has taken all
necessary steps to protect Tier 1 Trade Secrets and all reasonable steps to
protect Tier 2 Trade Secrets and the Trade Secrets of any other Person to
which it has a written, fiduciary or legal obligation of confidentiality.

confidential information agreements that appropriately protect the Company
Trade Secrets, there have been no disclosures by the Company Group, Company
Employees or Company Independent Contractors, of the Company Trade Secrets or
the Trade Secrets of any other Person to which the Company Group has a
written, fiduciary or legal obligation of confidentiality. No actions
have been taken by the Company Group, Company Employees or Company
Independent Contractors, which would adversely affect the Company Group\'s
ability to obtain U.S. or foreign protection (other than Patent protection)
for any Company Trade Secrets owned by the Combined Company or, to the
Knowledge of the Company Group, the ability of any other Person to obtain
U.S. or foreign protection (other than Patent protection) for any Company
Trade Secrets that are not Company Owned IP.   Section 4.8.6 License
Agreements.   Section 4.8.6.1 Section 4.8.6.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Company
Inbound Licenses, indicating for each the title and the parties thereto.
Section 4.8.6.1 (b) of the Company Disclosure    33    Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all Company Outbound Licenses,
indicating for each the title and the parties thereto.   Section 4.8.6.2
There are no delinquent fees, penalties, shortfall payments, bill backs or
other amounts outstanding under any Company Outbound License or Company
Inbound License, other than those disclosed on the Company Balance Sheet. No
member of the Company Group has received any written notice from the other
party to a Company Outbound License or Company Inbound License to the effect
that such Person will not accept business from or supply business to, as the
case may be, the Combined Company, Parent or the Surviving Company on such
terms, conditions and quantities consistent with past practices. To the
Knowledge of the Company Group, no event has occurred which would give rise
to such notice. To the Knowledge of the Company Group, no member of
the Company Group has received any oral notice from the other party to a
Company Outbound License or Company Inbound License to the effect that such
Person will not accept business from or supply business to, as the case may
be, the Combined Company, Parent or the Surviving Company on such terms,
conditions and quantities consistent with past practices. No licenses or
rights have been granted by any member of the Company Group or by any other
Person to distribute or otherwise use the source code of or create Derivative
Works of or from any Company Owned IP. No Company IP source code has been
disclosed by the Company Group to any Person other than a Company Employee
who has executed a Company NDA or Company Independent Contractor who has
executed a Company PRC and each of whom has or had a business need to access
such source code. As of the date hereof and the Closing Date, no non-Combined
Company Person has any exclusive right, license or permission to exercise any
rights under any of the Current Company IP. The Combined Company has provided
Parent with copies of each form of Company End User Agreement currently in
effect. Section 4.8.6.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes the
Combined Company\'s current policy with regard to entering into Company
Outbound License Agreements and Company End User Agreements.   Section
4.8.6.3 There is no outstanding or, to the Company Group\'s Knowledge,
threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to any Company Inbound
License or any Company Outbound License which dispute or disagreement would
result in the termination of, or suspension of, or otherwise adversely
impact, such license(s). To the Knowledge of the Company Group,
no circumstances exist which could give rise to such a dispute or
disagreement. The foregoing "Knowledge of the Company Group" qualifications
in this Section 4.8.6.3 shall not apply where a dispute or disagreement
would, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material impact upon the
Company Business. Correct and complete executed copies of all Company Inbound
Licenses and Company Outbound Licenses have been made available to
Parent.   Section 4.8.7 Ownership; Sufficiency of Intellectual Property.
The Company owns the entire right, title and interest in and to all Company
Owned IP, free and clear of Encumbrances, orders and arbitration awards. The
Company has a license or other right to use all Company Licensed IP that is
Current Company IP, to the Knowledge of Company Group, free and clear of
Encumbrances, orders and arbitration awards, provided that the foregoing
"Knowledge of the Company Group" qualification shall not apply where an
Encumbrance, order or arbitration award would, individually, or in the
aggregate, have a material impact upon the Company Business. The Company owns
or otherwise has the right to use all Current Company    34    IP as
such Current Company IP is used in the Company Business. The Current Company
IP constitutes all the Intellectual Property rights used in the operation of
the Company Business and are all such Intellectual Property rights necessary
to operate the Company Business after the Effective Time in substantially the
same manner the Company Business has been operated by the Combined Company
prior to the Effective Time. No member of the Company Group nor any Company
Person has made any submission to, and is not subject to any agreement with,
Standards Bodies, Governmental Authorities or other entities which would
obligate any member of the Company Group to grant licenses (other than
pursuant to the Company End User Agreements) to or otherwise impair
the Company\'s ownership, use or control of any Current Company IP.  
Section 4.8.8 No Infringement by the Company Group or Company Person. The
Company Owned IP (excluding the Company Owned Trademarks), the operation of
the Company Business and, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, the Company
Owned Trademarks and the Company Licensed IP when used in the Company
Business did not and does not Infringe upon, violate or constitute
the unauthorized use of any rights owned or controlled by any third party,
including any Intellectual Property of any other Person, provided that the
foregoing "Knowledge of the Company Group" qualification shall not apply to
Company Licensed IP where such an Infringement or unauthorized use,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a material impact upon the
Company Business. No litigation is now or has ever been pending and no notice
or claim (whether written or, to the Knowledge of the Company Group, oral)
has been received by the Company Group, (A) alleging that any member of the
Company Group has engaged in any activity or conduct that Infringes upon,
violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property
rights of any other Person, including any contamination or misappropriation
of Trade Secrets claims, or (B) challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any Company Owned IP or, to the Knowledge of the Company
Group, any Company Licensed IP. No Company Owned IP or, to the Knowledge of
the Company Group, any Company Licensed IP is subject to any outstanding
order, judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement (other than pursuant to the
express terms of each Company Inbound License Agreement or Company Outbound
License Agreement) restricting the use thereof by any member of the Company
Group or, in the case of Company Owned IP licensed by any member of the
Company Group to others, restricting the sale, transfer, assignment or
licensing thereof by any member of the Company Group to any Person. To the
Knowledge of the Company Group, no circumstances exist which could give rise
to any of the foregoing.   Section 4.8.9 No Infringement by Third Parties.
To the Knowledge of the Company Group, no third party is infringing any
Company IP. No claims for Infringement have been brought against any third
party by any member of the Company Group (whether written or, to the
Knowledge of the Company Group, oral). The Company Group has taken, at a
minimum, all reasonable steps to protect all Current Company IP or any other
Intellectual Property or confidential or proprietary information of any other
Person to whom any member of the Company Group has a legal, fiduciary,
contractual or other obligation of confidentiality or non-disclosure.  
Section 4.8.10 Assignment; Change of Control. The execution, delivery and
performance by each member of the Company Group of this Agreement and each of
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and the consummation of the
transactions    35    contemplated hereby and thereby, will not result
in or give rise to (i) any right of termination or other right to impair or

execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether alone or in connection with a subsequent event),
could result in the payment to any Company Group Employee of any money or
other property or could result in the increase, acceleration or   
39  provision of any payments, other rights or benefits to any Company

the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand, agree to take all
reasonable steps necessary to satisfy any conditions or requirements imposed
by any Governmental Authority in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than those conditions or

likely to result in either a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or materially adversely affect the economic
benefit of the transactions expected to be received by Parent hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall any party hereto be obligated to (A) agree
to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or
similar arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or

parties and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger,
the Stock Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and each party will keep the other parties
hereto apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein and therein.   (b) The parties to this
Agreement shall promptly advise each other party hereto upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements.   Section 7.4 Use of "KMV" Name and Company
Trademarks. Each of the Principal Members (other than KMV Corporation) and
the KMV Corporation Shareholders and their respective Affiliates agree that
from and after the Closing, they shall have no right to the use of the "KMV"
name or mark or any Company Trademarks, and each of the Principal Members and
the KMV Corporation Shareholders and their respective Affiliates shall take
all actions as may be necessary to terminate within five (5) Business Days
after the Closing Date the use by any of them of (i) the "KMV" name or mark
or any Company Trademarks or (ii) any two or more of the names "Kealhofer,"

and Employee Benefit Matters   (a) The Combined Company and Parent shall
seek to retain Other Employees through the Closing Date and for one (1) year
thereafter by offering aggregate compensation and benefits to each Other
Employee that possess substantially equivalent monetary value to the
aggregate non-equity based compensation and benefits that an Other Employee
is receiving in effect on the date of this Agreement, and as to equity based
compensation, by offering Parent stock options on standard terms in amounts
comparable to similarly situated Parent Employees with similar
responsibilities except that, from and after the Closing (i) performance-
based incentive compensation will be primarily based upon performance of the
Surviving Company as a separate business unit and in part based upon
performance of Parent\'s business as a whole and (ii) retirement benefits
will be provided under Parent\'s Section 401(k) and pension plan according to
their terms and will not include a SEP-IRA plan. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, the Combined Company and Parent will cooperate in
good faith with a view toward restructuring the compensation of each of the
Other Employees in accordance with the foregoing principles, effective upon
the Closing.    57     (b) The Combined Company\'s Benefit Plans shall

Parent, or terminated or modified by Parent and replaced by Parent\'s similar

For the purposes of this Section 7.6, the term "Applicable Sellers" shall
have the following meanings:   (i) With respect to any Tax items relating to
KMV Corporation, Applicable Sellers shall mean the KMV Corporation
Shareholders.   (ii) With respect to any Tax items relating to the Company
or its Subsidiaries, Applicable Sellers shall mean the Principal Members.  
(b) Parent and the Applicable Sellers agree that if KMV Corporation,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries shall be permitted to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period they will do so.   (c) The
Member Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and Parent shall
timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for KMV Corporation,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by law, all such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of
KMV Corporation, the Company and their Subsidiaries, respectively. Prior to
filing such Tax Returns, the Member Representative shall, no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the filing date of such Tax Returns, submit
copies of the same for review and filing by Parent. The Member Representative
shall execute such documents, if any, that are required to grant or confirm
the authority of Parent and its agents to properly file any such Tax Returns
on behalf of KMV Corporation, the Company and their respective subsidiaries.
The Applicable Sellers shall jointly and severally pay (subject to Section
10.6(a)) any liabilities in connection with Taxes levied or assessed upon KMV
Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties for any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date including, but not limited to, (i) any Taxes arising as a result of the
deemed sale of assets of KMV Corporation pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections or (ii) any Taxes arising with respect to the change in accounting
method adjustment described in Section 4.11(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   (d) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file
or cause to be timely filed any Tax Returns of KMV Corporation, the Company
or their respective Subsidiaries for Tax periods that begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). To the
extent permitted by law, all such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices of KMV Corporation, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries except as set forth in a separate letter agreement
between the Company and Parent dated the date hereof. Prior to filing such
Tax Returns, Parent shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
timely filing thereof, submit copies of the same for review and approval by
the Member Representative.    58     (e) Any Income Taxes for a
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Applicable Sellers and
Parent based on the actual operations of KMV Corporation, the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries during the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of such period beginning on the day following
the Closing Date. Other than PAYE, Value Added Tax, Stamp Duty and
Corporation Tax on chargeable gains in respect of KMV Europe Limited, all
Taxes other than Income Taxes ("Other Taxes") relating to a Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between Parent and the Applicable Sellers based
on the number of days during the portion of such period occurring on and
before the Closing Date, and the number of days during such period occurring
after the Closing Date. The Applicable Sellers shall jointly and severally
pay (subject to Section 10.6(a)) to Parent within fifteen (15) days after the
date on which Taxes are paid with respect to any Straddle Period an amount
equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. To the extent estimated Taxes
have been paid prior to the Closing Date with respect to a Straddle Period,
the Applicable Sellers\' liability with respect thereto shall be reduced by
that amount; provided, however, that if such payment or accrual of Taxes
exceeds the Applicable Sellers\' liability as calculated pursuant to this
Section 7.6, Parent shall promptly pay the Applicable Sellers the amount of
such excess. In respect of KMV Europe Limited, PAYE, Value Added Tax, Stamp
Duty and Corporation Tax on chargeable gains to the extent accrued before
Closing Date shall be the liability of the Applicable Seller. Any liability
due to PAYE, Value Added Tax, Stamp Duty and Corporation Tax on chargeable
gains accrued after Closing Date shall be the liability of Parent.   (f)
Any Tax refunds that are received by Parent, KMV Corporation, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited
against Tax to which Parent, KMV Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries becomes entitled, that relate to Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the Applicable Sellers, except to the extent such refund arises as
a result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Post-
Closing Period or a Post-Closing Partial Period. Parent shall pay over to the
Applicable Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
fifteen (15) days of receipt or entitlement thereto.   (g) After the
Closing Date, Parent, KMV Corporation, the Surviving Company and their
respective Subsidiaries and the Applicable Sellers shall provide each other
with such cooperation and information relating to KMV Corporation, the
Surviving Company or their respective Subsidiaries as the parties reasonably
may request in (i) filing any Tax Return, (ii) determining any liability for
Taxes or a right to a Tax refund or (iii) conducting or defending any
proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall
include provisions by Parent to provide powers of attorney for the purpose of
signing Tax Returns and defending any Tax Audits for Pre-Closing Periods.  
(h) With respect to the sale of the KMV Corporation Shares hereunder, the KMV
Corporation Shareholders and Parent shall jointly make all available Section
338(h)(10) Elections in accordance with applicable Tax Laws as set
forth herein. Parent and the KMV Corporation Shareholders agree to report
the transfers under this Agreement consistent with Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do
so by applicable Tax Laws pursuant to a final determination. Parent may, at
its election, make an election under Section 338 of the Code and any
corresponding election under any other relevant    59    Tax Laws with
respect to Parent\'s acquisition of the Foreign Subsidiaries. The Applicable
Sellers shall make such filings, cooperate with Parent and take any such
other actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to accomplish
such election.   (i) Parent shall be responsible for the preparation and
filing of all Section 338 Forms, including Form 8023, in accordance with
applicable Tax Laws and the terms of this Agreement. The Member
Representative shall deliver to Parent such documents or forms as are
reasonably requested and are required by an relevant Tax Laws to properly
complete the Section 338 Forms, at least sixty-five (65) days prior to the
date such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. Parent shall deliver
such documents and forms to the Member Representative in a form suitable for
execution at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date such Section 338
Forms are required to be filed, and the KMV Corporation Shareholders shall
execute such documents or forms and deliver said executed Section 338 Forms
to Parent at least twenty (20) days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms
are required to be filed.   (j) The parties hereto acknowledge that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will cause a termination
for federal income tax purposes under Section 708 of the Code of the Company
and its domestic Subsidiaries and a corresponding closing of the taxable year
of each such entity on the date of such termination. Prior to the Closing,
the Member Representative and Parent shall jointly prepare, and the Member
Representative shall cause the applicable Members of the Company and its
domestic Subsidiaries to sign, an election under Section 754 of the Code with
respect to the Company and its domestic Subsidiaries. The Principal Members
shall cause such elections to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service on
Internal Revenue Service Forms 1065 for the applicable entity for the short
taxable year ending on the Closing Date and shall not seek to revoke such
election.   (k) The parties hereto agree that as soon as reasonably
practical after the Closing, and prior to the filing of any Tax Return which
includes information related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration payable to the KMV
Corporation Shareholders pursuant to the Stock Purchase shall be allocated
among the assets of KMV Corporation and the non-compete agreement described
in Section 7.11 of this Agreement in accordance with an allocation schedule
(the "KMV Corporation Purchase Price Allocation Schedule") proposed by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Member Representative. The parties hereto
also agree that as soon as reasonably practical after the Closing, and prior
to the filing of any Tax Return which includes information related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the sum of (i) the aggregate
amount of the Cash Consideration payable to Holders of Company Units pursuant
to the Merger plus (ii) the aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration
payable to KMV Corporation Shareholders pursuant to the Stock Purchase that
is allocable to Company Units owned by KMV Corporation shall be allocated
among the assets of the Company and the non-compete agreement described in
Section 7.11 of this Agreement in accordance with an allocation schedule (the
"Company Purchase Price Allocation Schedule" and, together with the KMV
Corporation Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the "Purchase Price
Allocation Schedules") proposed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Member Representative. For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts allocated
above shall not be reduced by the Combined Company Transaction Fees, which
for Tax purposes shall be treated as paid, as applicable, to Holders of
Company Units pursuant to the Merger and KMV Corporation Shareholders
pursuant to the Stock Purchase and as subsequently    60    paid by
such Persons to the ultimate recipients thereof. The Purchase
Price Allocation Schedules shall be prepared in a manner required by Section
1060 or Section 338, as applicable, of the Code and other Applicable Law and
delivered by Parent to the Member Representative within forty-five (45) days
after the Closing. In connection with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedules, Parent and the Member Representative shall discuss the allocations
of the consideration and attempt in good faith to reach agreement with
respect thereto. Provided Parent and the Member Representative reach
agreement with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedules, none of
the Principal Members, the KMV Corporation Shareholders, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent shall take any position on any Tax
Return inconsistent with the allocations set forth on the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedules, taking into account any necessary adjustments as a
result of Section 3.2.4 of this Agreement as agreed upon, unless required to
do so by a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service.   (l) For a
period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause
KMV Corporation, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries to retain all
Tax Returns, books and records (including computer files) of, or with respect
to the activities of, KMV Corporation, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.
If, within sixty (60) days after the end of the six-year period referred to
above, the Member Representative requests such Tax Returns, books or records,
Parent shall provide such requested Tax Returns, books or records to the
Member Representative.   (m) The Member Representative shall, in
consultation with Parent, control, manage and be solely responsible for any
audit, contest, claim, proceeding or inquiry with respect to Taxes for any
Taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and shall have the right,
in consultation with Parent, to settle or contest any such audit, contest,
claim, proceeding or inquiry; provided, however, that the Member
Representative shall not settle any such issue that would adversely affect
Parent, KMV Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (n) Parent shall, in
consultation with the Member Representative, control, manage and be solely
responsible for any audit, contest, claim, proceeding or inquiry with respect
to Taxes for any Straddle Period and shall have the right, in consultation
with the Member Representative, to settle or contest any such audit, contest,
claim, proceeding or inquiry; provided, however, that Parent shall not settle
any such issue that would adversely affect the Applicable Sellers, without

commercially reasonable basis) and maintain such policies and bonds in effect
until the Closing Date.   Section 7.8 Notification of Certain Matters. Each
party to this Agreement shall give prompt notice to the other parties, to the
extent known by such party, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event or existence of any condition that has caused or could reasonably
be expected to cause any of the representations or warranties of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time after the date of this Agreement, up to and including the
Closing Date; (b) the occurrence of any matter or event that is materially
adverse to the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations

Agreement shall execute such documents and other papers and perform such

time or from time to time after the Closing, any of the Principal Members or

their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members,
shareholders, representatives or agents, including any investment banker,

Covenants Related to the Sale of Goodwill. In consideration for the purchase
by Parent of all of his or her equity interests in the Combined Company, each
Non-Compete Member hereby covenants and agrees to the following:   (a)
Agreement Not To Compete. During the applicable Restrictive Period, each Non-
Compete Member hereby agrees, severally, for himself or herself, that such
Non-Compete Member shall not:   (i) acting alone, or in conjunction with
others, directly or indirectly, become involved as officer, director,
shareholder, owner, affiliate, salesperson, co-owner, partner, trustee,
promoter, technician, engineer, analyst, employee, agent, representative,
supplier, investor or lender, consultant, advisor or manager in any business
activity within the Territory which is competitive with any aspect of the
Restricted Business;   (ii) provide any service (as an employee, consultant
or otherwise), support, product, technology or Intellectual Property to any
Person, if such service, support, product, technology or Intellectual
Property is competitive with the Restricted Business; or   (iii) permit
such Non-Compete Member\'s name to be used in connection with any Person
which is competitive with the Restricted Business;   provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 7.11 shall prevent any Non-Compete Member from owning
as a passive investment less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares
of the capital stock of a publicly-held corporation if (x) such shares are
actively traded on an established national securities market in the United
States and (y) such Non-Compete Member is not otherwise associated directly
or indirectly with such corporation or any Affiliate of such corporation; and
provided, further, that nothing in this Section 7.11 shall prevent any Non-
Compete Member\'s passive investment in mutual funds or other pooled
investment vehicles, in each case over which such Non-Compete Member does not
exercise investment control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.11, a Non-Compete Member may (A) be employed by or perform services
for a Person engaged in the Restricted Business, provided, however that such
Non-Compete Member does not personally engage in any of the activities set
forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above while in such employ or while
performing such services or (B) engage in investment management services for
third parties that may involve activities set forth in clauses (i) through
(iii) above, so long as the provision of any credit risk data to
third parties (1) is limited to prospects and clients of such investment
management business, (2) is incidental to, and not a primary part of, such
investment management business, and (3) will not provide such third party
with data or the capacity to process data that is functionally substantially
similar to any products and services of the Restricted Business; provided,
however, that this clause (B) will not prohibit the provision of credit risk
analytics or data to clients or prospective clients of the investment
management business pursuant to licenses of credit risk data from the
Surviving Company or Parent. Parent agrees that, in the event any Non-Compete
Member enters into an investment management business as contemplated by the
foregoing, Parent will, if    64    requested, license credit risk
analytics and data to such Non-Compete Member for use in such investment
management business on terms no less favorable than Parent\'s or the
Surviving Company\'s terms for comparable services to their respective most
preferred similarly situated clients.  As used in this Section 7.11:   (A)
"Territory" shall mean the United States, the United Kingdom,  Japan and any
other place that the Combined Company conducts the  Restricted Business.  
(B) "Restricted Business" shall mean any business of the Combined  Company as
currently conducted by the Combined Company, including  without limitation
providing credit risk analytics or data to  financial institutions, corporate
or investment professionals  within other organizations and any projects
currently in  development associated with project fees such as the
portfolio  pilot and the pricing models.   (b) Acknowledgements of the Non-
Compete Members. Each Non-Compete Member acknowledges that the promises and
restrictive covenants that such Non-Compete Member is providing in this
Agreement are reasonable and necessary to the protection of the business to
be acquired by Parent pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and Parent\'s legitimate interests in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including the Company\'s goodwill).
Each Non-Compete Member acknowledges that, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, all of such Non-Compete Member\'s membership interests
in the Company and shares in KMV Corporation will be purchased by Parent.
Each Non-Compete Member further acknowledges that such Non-Compete Member
sold all of such Non-Compete Member\'s membership interests in the Company
and shares in KMV Corporation in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
that goodwill was a material consideration in Parent\'s decision to enter
into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. Each Non-Compete Member acknowledges that if such Non-Compete
Member were to engage in the Restricted Business subsequent to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, such competition could materially and adversely affect
the value of the business acquired by Parent in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.   (c) Independence of
Obligations. The covenants and obligations of the Non-Compete Members set
forth in this Section 7.11 shall be construed as independent of any other
agreement or arrangement (other than this Agreement) between any Non-Compete
Member, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand.   (d) Specific
Performance. Each Non-Compete Member hereby agrees that in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by such Non-Compete Member of any covenant,
obligation or other provision contained in this Section 7.11, Parent shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it) to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law to (a) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such   
65    covenant, obligation or other provision and (b) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach.   Section 7.12 State and
Foreign Takeover Statutes. Each member of the Company Group shall take all
steps necessary to exempt (or continue the exemption of) the transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable state or foreign takeover Law, as now
or hereafter in effect.   Section 7.13 Efforts of Parties to Close. Subject
to the provisions of Section 7.3 hereof, during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the
conditions precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the execution and delivery of any documents, certificates,
instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. During the period from the date of
this Agreement and continuing through the Closing, except as required by
Applicable Law or with the prior written consent of Parent, in the case of
KMV Corporation, the Company or any of the Principal Members or KMV
Corporation Shareholders, or the Company, in the case of Parent, no party to
this Agreement shall knowingly take any action which, or knowingly fail to
take any action the failure of which to be taken, could reasonably be
expected to: (a) result in any of the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the party taking or failing to take
such action being or becoming untrue in any material respect; (b) result in
any conditions to the Closing set forth in Article 8 not being satisfied; or
(c) result in a violation of any provision of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.   Section 7.14 Accounting Matters.   (a) Each member of the
Company Group shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent
and Parent\'s independent accountants in completing the audits of the
Combined Company for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999 as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement.   (b) The Company will complete an assessment of the
collectibility of its accounts receivable by the Closing Date to ensure that
an accounts receivable reserve is established in accordance with GAAP.  
Section 7.15 Expenses. Except as expressly provided otherwise in
this Agreement, the parties shall each bear their respective direct and
indirect expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, the Stock Purchase and
the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that (i) the
expenses of any audits of the Combined Company shall be paid by Parent and
(ii) any filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act shall be paid 50% by
Parent and 50% by the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders.
Parent hereby agrees to pay the Combined Company Transaction Fees on behalf
of the Combined Company at the Closing.   Section 7.16 Waiver of Rights to
Compensation. Each of the Principal Members and KMV Corporation Shareholders
hereby waives any right it, he or she may have to receive, from the Company,
KMV Corporation, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other   
66    Person, any amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of the
Merger, the Stock Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements including without limitation any
dissenter or appraisal rights under Applicable Law or Contract, other than as
expressly provided for in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.  
Section 7.17 Distributions to Members. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement (including the provisions of Section 7.1(k)
hereof), after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall be permitted to make the distributions to its Members set forth
on Exhibit G hereto.   Section 7.18 Final Closing Consideration Exhibit. At
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver the final Closing Consideration Exhibit to Parent, provided, however,
that the final Closing Consideration Exhibit shall only reflect (i) changes
in events between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date that are
not otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) such other
changes as are previously approved by Parent in writing, which prior written
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.   Section 7.19 Proprietary
Rights Agreements and Other Matters. The Combined Company shall cause each of
the Principal Members and any Key Employee who is not a Principal Member to
execute and deliver prior to closing a proprietary rights agreement
consistent with customary industry practice, or such other agreement
containing substantially similar protections and take such other actions
specified in the last paragraph of Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.   ARTICLE 8.  CONDITIONS TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER AND
THE STOCK PURCHASE   Section 8.1 Mutual Conditions. The obligations of each
party to this Agreement to consummate the Merger and the Stock Purchase shall
be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions, provided

culpable for waiving or closing over such condition, and (y) Parent shall
fully indemnify each such party for any liabilities or losses incurred by
each such party in connection with or arising out of waiving or closing over
such condition, such indemnification to be approved by the Company on behalf

Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger or the Stock Purchase

material manner or makes illegal consummation of the Merger or the Stock
Purchase;    67     (b) All consents, waivers, authorizations and
approvals required from all Governmental Authorities to consummate the Merger
and the Stock Purchase, without the imposition of conditions or requirements,
in the aggregate, the satisfaction of which by Parent or its Subsidiaries or

likely to result in either a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company
Material Adverse Effect shall have been obtained and shall remain in full
force and effect as of the Closing Date;   (c) In respect of the
notifications of the parties hereto pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
applicable antitrust or competition laws, the applicable waiting period(s)
and any extensions thereof shall have expired or terminated; and   (d) A

shall not have been declared by either Federal or state authorities and be
continuing nor shall there occur and be continuing any calamity or crisis in
the financial markets that either (i) renders Parent unable to access
or borrow funds in the ordinary course of business or make use of the United
States federal wire system, or (ii) renders the Escrow Agent unable to
receive the deposit of the Escrow Funds.   Section 8.2 Conditions to
Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s Obligations. The obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger and the Stock Purchase shall be subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions, any of which may be waived
in writing by Parent and Merger Sub:   (a) For purposes of this Section

as though all such representations and warranties had been made again on and
as of the Closing Date (provided, however, that the representations and
warranties that speak as of a specific date shall speak only as of such
date). The representations and warranties of the Company, KMV Corporation,
the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders qualified by
materiality or by reference to a Company Material Adverse Effect shall be

Principal Members and KMV Corporation Shareholders confirming the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 8.2(a) and (b);   (d)
Each of the Ancillary Agreements shall be in full force and effect and Parent
shall not be aware of any basis that would reasonably be expected to cause

being agreed and understood, however, that the foregoing shall have no effect
on any rights Parent or Merger Sub may have under Section 8.2(f) of this
Agreement);   (e) Parent shall have received an opinion dated the Closing

qualifications and orders of all Governmental Authorities and all other
Persons party to Contracts with any member of the Combined Company that are

aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, financial
conditions or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as

effect as of the Closing Date.   (h) Provided that Parent\'s independent

2001 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in owners\'
equity and cash flows for the year then ended shall not be materially adverse
when compared to the Company Balance Sheet and Company Financial Statements
for the corresponding period and dates, provided, however, that variances
shall be disregarded for purposes of this Section 8.2(h) to the extent they
are attributable to (i) depreciation, rental expense and vacation accruals in
accordance with GAAP rather than on a tax basis, (ii) any compensation
expense charge attributable to issuance of Company Units that may be required
in accordance with GAAP, or (iii) capitalization of software development
costs that may be required in accordance with GAAP.   (i) Unless Parent
consents otherwise in writing, the relevant member of the Combined Company
shall take all action necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, before
the Effective Time, any Benefit Plan that is a simplified employee pension

Exhibit I hereto and seven (7) out of the ten (10) Key Employees listed under
Group B on Exhibit I hereto shall have entered into employment agreements
with the Surviving Company or Parent for a period following the Closing on
mutually agreeable terms, provided however, that a failure of any one of the
foregoing to have accepted such employment shall be disregarded for purposes
of this Section 8.2(j) unless Parent has made an employment offer (an
"Eligible Offer") to such Person which (i) provides cash compensation
(assuming achievement of targeted financial performance of the unit
consistent with the budgeted operating plan of the Combined Company provided
to Parent prior to the date hereof (the "Budget")) at least substantially
equivalent to such Person\'s current cash compensation at such target
performance level (which current cash compensation is reflected in the Budget
and has been detailed prior to the date hereof for each such Person in
writing to the Parent (the "Compensation Submission")), and (except
as specified in the Compensation Submission) equity-linked compensation in
the form of Parent stock options on standard terms at least consistent with

forth in the Compensation Submission, provides for a role substantially
consistent with such Person\'s current role in the Combined Company, and
(iii) otherwise is on terms consistent with customary market practice for
comparable executive employment agreements, and such Person has failed to
enter into an employment agreement on the terms of such Eligible Offer.

the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders. The obligation of
the Company, KMV Corporation, the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation
Shareholders to consummate the Merger and the Stock Purchase shall be subject

Shareholders:   (a) For purposes of this Section 8.3(a), the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement
shall be assessed as of the date of this Agreement and shall be assessed as
of the Closing Date with the same effect as though all such representations
and warranties had been made again on and as of the Closing Date (provided,
however, that the representations and warranties that speak as of a specific
date shall speak only as of such date). The representations and warranties of
Parent qualified by materiality or by reference to a Parent Material Adverse
Effect shall be true and correct. The representations and warranties of
Parent not qualified by materiality or by reference to a Parent Material
Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all material respects;   (b)

agreements, covenants, obligations and conditions required by this Agreement
to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing Date;

The Company, KMV Corporation, the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation
Shareholders shall have received an opinion dated the Closing Date of Simpson

acceptable to the Company and KMV Corporation; and   (e) There shall not
exist any event or combination of events that, individually or in the
aggregate, will (or would reasonably be expected to) prevent Parent from
performing any of its post-Closing obligations under this Agreement or any

TERMINATION   Section 9.1 Termination.   (a) This Agreement may be
terminated prior to the Closing as follows:   (i) by written consent of
Parent, the Company on behalf of itself and each of the Principal Members and
KMV Corporation on behalf of itself and each of the KMV Corporation
Shareholders;   (ii) by Parent, the Company on behalf of itself and each of
the Principal Members or KMV Corporation on behalf of itself and each of the
KMV Corporation Shareholders, if any order of any Governmental Authority
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger or the Stock Purchase shall have become final and non-
appealable; provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(ii) shall, subject to Section
7.3(a), have used commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of and
to remove such order;   (iii) by Parent if any condition to the obligations
of Parent hereunder becomes incapable of fulfillment through no fault of
Parent and is not waived by Parent;   (iv) by the Company on behalf of
itself and each of the Principal Members and by KMV Corporation on behalf of
itself and each of the KMV Corporation Shareholders, if any condition to the
obligations of such party hereunder becomes incapable of fulfillment through
no fault of such party and is not waived by such party;   (v) by Parent,
the Company on behalf of itself and each of the Principal Members or KMV
Corporation on behalf of itself and each of the KMV Corporation Shareholders,
if the Closing does not occur by the close of business on or prior to April
24, 2002 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the Termination
Date may be extended by Parent, the Company on behalf of itself and each of
the Principal Members or KMV Corporation on behalf of itself and each of the
KMV Corporation Shareholders by written notice to the other parties if the
Closing shall not have been consummated as a direct result of the condition
set forth in Sections 8.1(b) and (c) failing to have been satisfied and the
extending party (x)    71    reasonably believes that the relevant
approvals will be obtained during such extension period, and (y) so long as
the extending party is diligently pursuing such approvals, but in any case
such extension shall not be more than one hundred twenty days (120) days
after April 24, 2002; notwithstanding the foregoing, a party who is or whose
Affiliate is in material breach of any of its obligations or representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall not
have the right to terminate or extend this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(a)(v).   (b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by
the delivery by the party terminating this Agreement to each other party of
a written notice of such termination. If this Agreement so terminates, it
shall become null and void and have no further force or effect, except as
provided in Section 9.2.   Section 9.2 Survival after Termination. If this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof and the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect,
without any liability on the part of any party hereto, except for the
provisions of Sections 7.15, 11.5, 11.8, 11.9 and 11.10 and this Article 9.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any
party to this Agreement of liability for a breach of any provision of this
Agreement or any agreement made as of the date hereof or subsequent thereto
pursuant to this Agreement.   ARTICLE 10.  INDEMNIFICATION   Section 10.1
Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants; Exclusive Monetary
Remedies.   (a) All representations and warranties in this Agreement or in
any instrument executed and delivered in fulfillment of the requirements of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing for eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date"), except that the representations
and warranties in Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b), 4.2(a), 4.3, 4.5, 4.11, 4.17, 5.1,
5.2, 5.4, 6.1 and 6.2 shall not terminate, but shall continue until the
expiration of the respective statutes of limitations relating thereto,
provided however, that the representations and warranties in Section
4.3(c)(ii) shall terminate on the Expiration Date unless a Parent Indemnitee
makes a claim pursuant to Section 10.2.1(a) of this Agreement that a breach
under Section 4.3(c)(ii) either (i) resulted in the unenforceability of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or (ii) prevented Parent from
consummating the Merger, the Stock Purchase or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. All covenants or
other agreements in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely or
for such lesser period of time as may be expressly specified herein with
respect thereto or until the respective statutes of limitation relating
thereto, provided, however, that the covenants in Sections 7.1, 7.2(a), 7.3,
7.5, 7.7, 7.8, 7.12, 7.13, 7.14, 7.17 and 7.18 shall terminate on the
Expiration Date.   (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
Contrary, the sole and exclusive basis on which any party may recover
monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement by any other party, whether
based upon breach of representations and warranties,    72    breach
of any covenant, or otherwise, shall be in accordance with
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 10, and subject to
the limitations, exclusions, caps and thresholds set forth in this Article
10, provided however, that such exclusive remedies for monetary damages shall
not preclude any party from pursuing the remedies of specific
performance, injunctive relief, declaratory judgment or any other non-
monetary equitable remedies available to such party under Applicable Law.  
Section 10.2 Indemnification by the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation
Shareholders.   Section 10.2.1 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations
contained in this Article 10 (including, without limitation, the limitations
contained in Section 10.2.3(b) of this Agreement), the Company (prior to the
Closing Date) and each Principal Member and KMV Corporation Shareholder
jointly and severally (from and after the Closing Date, and subject to
Section 10.6(a)) shall indemnify and hold Parent, KMV Corporation, the
Surviving Company and each of their Subsidiaries, and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, members, stockholders, agents and
representatives ("Parent Indemnitees") harmless from and against all losses,
damages, liabilities, claims, demands, obligations, deficiencies, payments,
judgments, settlements, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever
(including the costs and expenses of any and all investigations, actions,
suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, orders, settlements and
compromises relating thereto, and reasonable attorneys\', accountants\',
experts\' and other fees and expenses in connection therewith) ("Losses")
resulting from, arising out of, or due to, directly or indirectly, any of the
following:   (a) Any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of,
any representation or warranty of the Company or KMV Corporation contained
in Article 4 of this Agreement, in any schedule or exhibit delivered
hereunder by the Company or KMV Corporation or in any certificates delivered
by the Company or KMV Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, or any breach
or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of the Company or KMV
Corporation contained in this Agreement, in any schedule or exhibit delivered
hereunder by the Company or KMV Corporation or in any certificates delivered
by the Company or KMV Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, or any claims,
causes of actions, rights asserted or demands made by any third parties
(including any Governmental Authority) arising from or relating to any of the
foregoing (it being agreed that for purposes of such right to
indemnification, the representations and warranties made by the Company or
KMV Corporation (except as specifically set forth in all provisions of
Section 4.8 of this Agreement, except Section 4.8.13) shall be deemed
not qualified by any references therein to materiality or whether or not any
breach could result or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect), provided, however, that a breach of the
representations and warranties in Section 5.1 of this Agreement by a
Principal Member or a KMV Corporation Shareholder shall not, in and of
itself, constitute a breach by the Company or KMV Corporation of the
representations and warranties in Section 4.5 of this Agreement;   (b) Any
shortfall in the Working Capital Amount or Cash Capital Amount in excess of
the Working/Cash Capital Holdback Amount, as determined in accordance with
Section 3.2.4 hereof;    73     (c) Any Third-Party Claims for a breach
by the Combined Company prior to the Closing Date of, or a default by the
Combined Company prior to the Closing Date under, any Contract between the
Combined Company and any customer or client of the Combined Company prior to
the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Principal Members and the KMV
Corporation Shareholders shall have no obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless any Parent Indemnitee against any Losses claimed pursuant to this
Section 10.2.1(c) unless such Parent Indemnitee shall have delivered a notice
of such claim pursuant to Sections 10.2.3 or 10.4 hereof to the indemnifying
party before the Expiration Date; and   (d) In the event the Combined
Company does not obtain the consent to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with respect to the contract identified as the third item on
Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and cure the default under
such contract referred to in Section 4.7 of such Schedule, and as a result
the contract is terminated or ceases to be performed by the counterparty, any
incremental, direct out-of-pocket costs and expenses that are incurred by the
Combined Company or Parent after the Closing resulting therefrom, including
the incremental cost of obtaining a replacement agreement providing services
to the Combined Company substantially similar to those provided under such
terminated agreement and any incremental costs relating to obtaining or
collecting substitute data or funding customer reimbursements, reprogramming
costs, preparation of revised marketing materials and other collateral
materials in connection with such replacement (all such costs and expenses
incurred within eighteen months following the Closing Date, collectively,
"Replacement Costs"), provided that the aggregate amount of
such indemnification for Replacement Costs shall be limited to the first
$500,000 of such Replacement Costs plus one-half of the next $2,000,000 of
such Replacement Costs (which amounts shall be treated as Losses for all
other purposes of this Agreement).   Section 10.2.2 Individual
Indemnification. Subject to the limitations contained in this Article 10,
from and after the Closing Date, each Principal Member and KMV Corporation
Shareholder shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold each Parent
Indemnitee harmless from and against all Losses resulting from, arising out
of, or due to, directly or indirectly, any inaccuracy or misrepresentation
in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by such Principal
Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder contained in Article 5 of this
Agreement, in any schedule or exhibit delivered hereunder by such Principal
Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder or in any certificates delivered by
such Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder pursuant to this
Agreement, or any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant of such Principal
Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder contained in this Agreement, in any
schedule or exhibit delivered hereunder by such Principal Member or
KMV Corporation Shareholder or in any certificates delivered by such
Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement,
or any claims, causes of actions, rights asserted or demands made by any
third parties (including any Governmental Authority) arising from or relating
to any of the foregoing (it being agreed that for purposes of such right to
indemnification, the representations and warranties made by the Principal
Members or the KMV Corporation Shareholders shall be deemed not qualified by
any references therein to materiality or whether or not any breach could
result or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect).   Section 10.2.3 Escrow Account Offset; Waiver.   
74     (a) For purposes of this Section 10.2 and Section 10.7, in the
event that a Parent Indemnitee wishes to make any indemnification claim under
this Section 10.2 or Section 10.7, such Parent Indemnitee shall first provide
written notice of such claim (an "Indemnification Notice") to the Escrow
Agent and the Member Representative and, with respect to any indemnification
claim under Section 10.2.2 of this Agreement, to the Principal Member(s)
and/or KMV Corporation Shareholder(s) from whom indemnification is sought.
Any such notice shall, to the extent practicable, set forth in reasonable
detail (w) the individual items of Losses; (x) the basis for the claim,
including the alleged misrepresentation or breach; (y) the amount of the
claim and (z) the date each such item of Losses was paid or properly accrued,
if applicable. Thereafter, the Member Representative or, with respect to any
indemnification claim under Section 10.2.2 of this Agreement, the Principal
Member(s) and/or KMV Corporation Shareholder(s) from whom indemnification is
sought, shall have twenty (20) Business Days following such party\'s receipt
of the Indemnification Notice in which to deliver notice of objection to such
claim to the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent. If no objection notice
is given, then the claim in the amount alleged by the Parent Indemnitee in
the Indemnification Notice shall be deemed to be valid and indemnifiable
pursuant hereto. No offset shall be permitted if the relevant claim is timely
disputed as set forth above, unless and until its validity is finally
resolved. In the event that the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to offset as a
result of the final resolution of the validity of such claim, such Parent
Indemnitee and the Member Representative or, with respect to any
indemnification claim under Section 10.2.2 of this Agreement, the
Principal Member(s) and/or KMV Corporation Shareholder(s) from whom
indemnification is sought (the "Notifying Person"), shall provide joint
written notice (the "Resolved Claim Notice") of such offset to the Escrow
Agent. If the Notifying Person has not so provided the Resolved Claim Notice
to the Escrow Agent within ten (10) days after the demand of the Parent
Indemnitee in writing to the Notifying Person, then the Parent Indemnitee
will be permitted to unilaterally deliver a Resolved Claim Notice (a
"Unilateral Resolved Claim Notice") to the Escrow Agent so long as the Parent
Indemnitee provides written notice of the delivery to the Escrow Agent of
such Unilateral Resolved Claim Notice to the Notifying Person within five (5)
days thereafter. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Resolved
Claim Notice or, in the case of a Unilateral Resolved Claim Notice, within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt thereof, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to Parent Escrow Funds in the amount of the offset set forth in the
Resolved Claim Notice or the Unilateral Resolved Claim Notice; provided,
however, that the Escrow Agent shall not make such delivery in respect of a
Unilateral Resolved Claim Notice if the Notifying Person has prior to the
date of such delivery provided notice to the Escrow Agent and the
Parent Indemnitee of a written objection asserting that the Unilateral
Resolved Claim Notice was improperly given.   (b) With respect to
indemnification claims under Section 10.2.1 of this Agreement, if and to the
extent the amount of the offset remains unfulfilled after delivery of the
Escrow Funds as set forth in subsection (a) above, the Principal Members and
the KMV Corporation Shareholders shall be severally, and not jointly, liable
for the delivery to such Parent Indemnitee, in cash, of the amount of the
offset remaining after payment of the Escrow Funds equal to such Principal
Member\'s or KMV Corporation Shareholder\'s Allocable Share of such excess
Losses, as applicable, subject to the limitations contained in
Section 10.6(a) hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that in no event shall any
Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder be liable under Section
10.2.1 of this Agreement for the Allocable Share of Losses of any other
Principal Member or KMV    75    Corporation Shareholder. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Allocable Share" shall mean, as to each Principal Member
and KMV Corporation Shareholder, the percentage set forth opposite their
respective names on Exhibit L hereto.   (c) With respect to indemnification
claims under Section 10.2.2 of this Agreement, (i) a Parent Indemnitee shall
only be entitled to offset Escrow Funds beneficially held by the Principal
Member(s) and/or KMV Corporation Shareholder(s), as the case may be, from
whom indemnification is sought under Section 10.2.2, and (ii) if and to the
extent the amount of the offset remains unfulfilled after delivery of the
Escrow Funds beneficially held by such Principal Member or KMV Corporation
Shareholder, as the case may be, such Principal Member or KMV Corporation
Shareholder, as the case may be, from whom indemnification is sought shall be
severally liable for the delivery to such Parent Indemnitee, in cash, of the
full amount of such offset remaining after payment of the Escrow Funds
beneficially held by such Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder, as
the case may be, subject to the limitations contained in Section 10.6(a).  
Section 10.3 Indemnification by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and KMV Corporation (prior to the Closing) and each
of the Principal Members and KMV Corporation Shareholders (from and after the
Closing) ("Seller Indemnitees") from and against all Losses resulting from,
arising out of, or due to, directly or indirectly, any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of Parent
or Merger Sub contained in Article 6 of this Agreement, in any schedule or
exhibit delivered hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub or in any certificates
delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, or any breach
or nonfulfillment of any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement, in any schedule or exhibit delivered hereunder by Parent or Merger
Sub or in any certificates delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, or any claims, causes of actions, rights asserted or demands made
by any third parties (including any Governmental Authority) arising from or
relating to any of the foregoing.   Section 10.4 Procedures for Third-Party
Claims.   (a) Third-Party Claims. In order for a Person (the "Indemnified
Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 10.2
or 10.3 hereof in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third-
Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of written
notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, as promptly as practicable following
the Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim that are not separately addressed to the indemnifying
party.   (b) Assumption. If a Third-Party Claim is made against an
Indemnified Party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided, however,   
76   that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified
Party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense;
provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate counsel (i) if the parties to any such action
or proceeding (including impleaded parties) include any of the Principal
Members or KMV Corporation Shareholders and representation of both parties
would, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party, be
inappropriate due to a conflict of interest or (ii) if the indemnifying party
shall not have employed counsel (other than counsel that is reasonably
objected to by the Indemnified Party) within a reasonable time after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the institution of a Third-Party Claim
in compliance with Section 10.4(a) hereof. The indemnifying party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not
assumed the defense thereof, provided, however, that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim, all the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof at
the indemnifying party\'s expense. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the indemnifying party\'s request) the provision to the
indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of
a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim
without the indemnifying party\'s prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the indemnifying party
may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay
the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim,
which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such
Third-Party Claim and that would not otherwise materially adversely affect
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party
shall have the right to jointly control the defense of any Third-Party Claim
against such Indemnified Party in the event the potential Losses with respect
to such Third Party Claim, when aggregated with all other satisfied or
pending Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1, 10.2 and
10.3 hereof exceed the limits set forth in Section 10.6(a), in the case of
any Parent Indemnitee, or Section 10.6(b), in the case of any
Seller Indemnitee.   Section 10.5 Termination of Indemnification. The
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any Person pursuant to Sections
10.2.1, 10.2.2 or 10.3 hereof shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to Section 10.1
hereof; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person
to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a bona fide claim by delivering a notice of such claim to the
indemnifying party.    77     Section 10.6 Limitations; Maximum
Liability.   (a) Principal Members and KMV Corporation Shareholders.   (i)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Principal
Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders shall not be obligated
to indemnify any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to Sections 10.2.1(a), 10.2.1(c)
or 10.2.2 of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Losses suffered by all Parent Indemnitees (excluding all Parent Indemnitee
First-Dollar Losses) exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then only to the
extent of any such excess; provided, however, that the Threshold Amount shall
not apply to Parent Indemnitee First-Dollar Losses or in the case of common
law fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal activity on the part of
any Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder.   (ii) Except for the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.7 of this Agreement or in
the case of common law fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal
activity on the part of any Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder,
the aggregate indemnification obligations of the Principal Members and the
KMV Corporation Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to a
maximum of $70,000,000; provided, however, that the aggregate indemnification
obligations of the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders
pursuant to this Agreement for breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b), 4.3 (other than Section 4.3(c)(ii),
unless the Loss under Section 4.3(c)(ii) results from the unenforceability of
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or from Parent being unable
to consummate the Merger, the Stock Purchase or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements), 4.5, 5.1 or 5.2
of this Agreement shall be limited to a maximum of $210,000,000; and
provided, further, that in all cases the indemnification obligations of an
individual Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the
gross Transaction Consideration that such Principal Member or KMV Corporation
Shareholder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement, except for the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10.7 of this Agreement or in
the case of common law fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal
activity on the part of such individual Principal Member or KMV Corporation
Shareholder.   (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the expressions of "joint and several" with respect to certain
liabilities under this Agreement of the Principal Members and KMV Corporation
Shareholders are solely to permit the recovery of such liabilities on that
basis from the Escrow Funds, and the parties agree that in all other
circumstances in which any liability under this Agreement is being enforced
against a Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder, such Principal
Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder shall only be liable for its Allocable
Share of the applicable total liability, and up to its Allocable Share of the
applicable limits set forth above, except solely in the case of liabilities
under Sections 7.9(b), 7.11 and 10.2.2, as to which such Principal Member or
KMV Corporation Shareholder shall bear the full amount of the applicable
liability up to the amount of the gross Transaction Consideration that such
Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement.    78     (b) Parent. Except in the case of
common law fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal activity on the
part of Parent, the aggregate indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant
to this Agreement shall be limited to a maximum of $210,000,000.   Section
10.7 Tax Indemnification.   (a) The Applicable Sellers shall jointly and
severally (subject to Section 10.6(a)) indemnify and hold each of the Parent
Indemnitees harmless from and against all Taxes of KMV Corporation, the
Applicable Sellers, the Company, the Surviving Company and any of their
respective Subsidiaries (i) with respect to all Pre-Closing Periods,
including, but not limited to, any Taxes arising as a result of the deemed
sale of assets of KMV Corporation, pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, (ii) with respect to any period beginning before the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date, but only with respect to the portion of
such period up to and including the Closing Date (such portion, a "Pre-
Closing Partial Period"), (iii) with respect to the change in
accounting method adjustment described in Section 4.11(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (iv) payable as a result of a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.11 of this Agreement (it
being agreed that for purposes of such right to indemnification, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.11 of this Agreement
shall be deemed not qualified by any references therein to materiality or
whether or not any breach could result or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect) and (v) resulting from any
breach of Section 7.6 by the Applicable Sellers, KMV Corporation, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Applicable Sellers shall be
entitled to any net refunds of Taxes with respect to the periods described in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, except to the extent such refund arises as a
result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Post-Closing
Period or a Post-Closing Partial Period.   (b) Parent shall, and shall cause
KMV Corporation, the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries, to
indemnify and hold each of the Applicable Sellers harmless from and against
all Taxes of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (i) with respect to
all Post-Closing Periods, (ii) with respect to any period beginning before
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, but only with respect to
the portion of such period beginning the day after the Closing Date (such
portion, a "Post-Closing Partial Period") and (iii) resulting from any breach
of any covenant of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent
shall be entitled to all refunds of Taxes with respect to the periods
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above.   (c) Any Taxes for a period
including a Pre-Closing Partial Period and a Post-Closing Partial Period
shall be apportioned between such Pre-Closing Partial Period and such Post-
Closing Partial Period shall be determined pursuant to Section 7.6(e) of this
Agreement.   Section 10.8 Calculation and Payment of Losses. In no event
shall any Loss be recoverable to the extent it is based on incidental or
consequential damages, including but not limited to Losses measured by
reductions in the trading value of a party\'s stock or based upon the
application of revenue or earnings multiples to direct damages. The amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article 10 shall be
net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under
insurance policies with respect to such Loss and shall be (i) increased to
take account of any increase in the premiums charged to the Indemnified Party
under any insurance policy arising from the incurrence or payment of such
Loss; (ii) increased to    79    take account of any net Tax cost
incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity
payments hereunder and (iii) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
such Loss, in each case as reasonably determinable at the time such Loss is
otherwise being determined under this Agreement. Except as otherwise required
by Applicable Law, any indemnity payments under this Agreement shall be
treated as adjustments to the Transaction Consideration for United States
federal income tax purposes.   ARTICLE 11.  MISCELLANEOUS   Section 11.1
Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, altered or modified
except by written instrument executed by Parent, KMV Corporation, the
Company, the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders. Any
agreement on the part of Parent, KMV Corporation, the Company, the Principal
Members and the KMV Corporation Shareholders to waive (i) any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein by the Company, KMV
Corporation, any of the Principal Members or any of the KMV Corporation
Shareholders, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the
Company, KMV Corporation, the Principal Members and the KMV Corporation
Shareholders, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or (ii)
compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions contained
herein, shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No such
waiver shall constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other inaccuracy, breach or failure to strictly comply with the
provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Principal
Member hereby authorizes the Company and each KMV Corporation Shareholder
hereby authorizes KMV Corporation to waive any condition or provision of this
Agreement or to take any other action under this Agreement, including
amending this Agreement in any respect, prior to or after the Closing, and
any such waiver, action or amendment shall be binding on each such
Principal Member and KMV Corporation Shareholder without any further action
on their part; provided, however, that no amendment may (a) treat a Principal
Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder in a manner that is disproportionately
adverse relative to all other Principal Members and KMV Corporation
Shareholders, or (b) amend any provision of Section 7.11 applicable to a
Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder, in either case without such
Principal Member\'s or KMV Corporation Shareholder\'s written consent to such
amendment. Each Principal Member and KMV Corporation Shareholder further
acknowledges that no Principal Member or KMV Corporation Shareholder shall
have any individual ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article
9.   Section 11.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Principal Members Disclosure Schedule, the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, any other exhibits, schedules, certificates,
lists and documents referred to herein, and any documents executed by the
parties simultaneously herewith or pursuant thereto), the Ancillary
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
of the parties hereto, except as provided herein, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.    80     Section 11.3
Interpretation.   (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
an Exhibit or a Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"

"without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date

warranties or one or more of its covenants contained in Article 7 of this
Agreement, in each case making reference to the particular subsection of this
Agreement requiring such disclosure or to which such exception is being
taken, provided, however, that the disclosure of an item in one Section of
any party\'s Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed a disclosure in another
Section or Sections of such party\'s Disclosure Schedule if and to the extent
that such information is readily apparent to be so applicable to such other
Section or Sections.   Section 11.4 Severability. Any term or provision of
this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.   Section 11.5 Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein, all
