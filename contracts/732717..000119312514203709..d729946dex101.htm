with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL
and the DLLCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the

EXCHANGE

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock,_ " and each a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or the Company, not
held on behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares that are owned by
stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not

Share_ " and, collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into
the right to receive, and become exchangeable for a number of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") _plus_ $28.50 in cash (the "
_Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all the Shares (other than
the Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and (B) each
uncertificated Share (an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") registered to a holder on
the stock transfer books of the Company (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(e) cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which such Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Section 4.1(a) and any distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 4.2(c),
and each certificate formerly representing Shares owned by Dissenting
Stockholders shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment
of which reference is made in Section 4.3.

 



-3- For purposes of this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the following

the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.724; 

B) If the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than or equal to
$34.903 but less than or equal to $38.577 then the Exchange Ratio shall be an
amount equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (x) $66.50 by (y) the
Average Parent Stock Price; or

 

C) If the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount less than $34.903, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be 1.905.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Average Parent Stock Price_ " shall mean
the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by the parties) on each of the thirty consecutive
Trading Days ending on (and including) the Trading Day that is three Trading
Days prior to the date of the Effective Time.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Trading Day_ " shall mean a day on which
shares of Parent Common Stock are traded on the NYSE.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Subject to Section 4.3, each Excluded
Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each membership interest in Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding from and after the Effective Time as the membership interests of
the Surviving Company in the Merger.

 

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates._

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Companys
prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) an
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
uncertificated form or book-entry form and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash,
in each case, comprising approximately the amounts required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in respect of Shares. In addition, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) with respect to the Parent Common Stock
with respect to Shares with a

 



-4-  record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender
of such Shares and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 4.2(e). All shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, together with the
amount of any such cash dividends and distributions deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 4.2(a), shall hereinafter be referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such
investments, if interest bearing, shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to
make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under this Section 4.2(a) shall be promptly
returned to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within four business days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent, and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g))
in exchange for the Merger Consideration to the Exchange Agent. Upon the
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in Section 4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE IV in
uncertificated form (or evidence of shares in book-entry form), and (ii) an
amount in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions
are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required
Tax withholding provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to (A) the cash amount that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a) plus (B) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.2(e) plus (C) any
unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive

 



-5-  pursuant to Section 4.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock in uncertificated
form, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in respect thereof, may
be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
If any shares (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) of Parent Common
Stock are to be issued to a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any stock
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) of Parent Common Stock in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. (i) All
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable in the Merger. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with
this ARTICLE IV. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(g)), there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest
thereon, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B)
at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time, but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

(ii) Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to
vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders with a
record date at or after the Effective Time the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificates, regardless of whether
such holders have exchanged their Certificates.

 



-6- (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
but for this Section 4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and
shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a share of Parent
Common Stock based on the Average Parent Stock Price.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any
Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company
for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option,
to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE IV shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock of such stockholder
and payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect of
the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to the provisions of
this ARTICLE IV (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(h)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section
4.2(g)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it, the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock and the cash and any dividends and other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock that would have been issuable or payable
pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE IV (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) had such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so

 



-7-  withheld by the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Company, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company or Parent, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) materials advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of their Shares into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) issue in registered form to
each holder of Uncertificated Shares that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of each such
Uncertificated Share pursuant to this ARTICLE IV, cash that such holder is
entitled to receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to Section 4.1(a), cash
pursuant to Section 4.2(e) in lieu of fractional shares in respect of each
such Uncertificated Share and any dividends and other distributions in respect
of the Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to the provisions of
this ARTICLE IV (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(h)), without interest thereon.

 

4.3. _Dissenters  Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock or cash or any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE IV unless and until
the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Merger under
the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only
the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned
by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with respect to any Shares,
such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been
converted into the shares of Parent Common Stock plus the cash amount that
such Person is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a). The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock

 



-8-  dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate
the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration.

4.5. _Company Stock Based Plans_. (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Company Stock
Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to
acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Shares
subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) the exercise
price per Share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company
Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code. The " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean a
fraction (x) the numerator of which is the sum of the Cash Consideration and
an amount equal to the product of (I) the Exchange Ratio and (II) the Average
Parent Stock Price and (y) the denominator of which is the Average Parent
Stock Price. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective
Time, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the terms and
conditions applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including all vesting conditions.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding right to receive Shares or cash
pursuant to the exercise of any stock appreciation right (a " _Company SAR_
") under the Company Stock Plans, vested or unvested, shall be converted into
a stock appreciation right on the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) determined by
multiplying (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company SAR immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at a reference
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the result
obtained by dividing (A) the reference price per Share of such Company SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ that the reference price and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Company SAR shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company SAR
shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions applicable to such
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all vesting
conditions.

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit (" _Company
Restricted Stock Unit_ ") under the Company Stock Plans, vested or unvested,
other than restricted stock units that as of the Effective Time remain subject
to a performance condition (" _Company Performance Stock Units_ ") shall be
converted into a restricted stock unit on the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Unit_ ") equal to the product (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) determined by

 



-9-  multiplying (i) the number of shares underlying such Company Restricted
Stock Unit by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided
above, following the Effective Time, each Parent Stock Unit shall continue to
be governed by the terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including all time-based vesting conditions and dividend equivalent rights.

(d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Performance Stock Unit
under the Company Stock Plans, vested or unvested, shall be converted into a
Parent Stock Unit on the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) determined by multiplying
(i) the number of Shares underlying such Company Performance Stock Unit, by
(ii) the Option Exchange Ratio. Performance for any fiscal years of the
Company that have ended prior to the Effective Time will be based on the
actual performance achieved and performance for fiscal years of the Company
that have not ended prior to the Effective Time will conclusively be based on
the target level. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each Parent Stock Unit shall continue to be governed by the
terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Performance
Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any applicable
time-based vesting requirements and dividend equivalent rights.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and
each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans
and any other Company Plans, other than the Company Options, the Company SARs,
the Company Restricted Stock Units and the Company Performance Stock Units
(the " _Company Awards_ ") shall be converted into the right to acquire or
receive, as the case may be, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) determined by
multiplying (i) such Shares by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, and such
Company Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions
applicable to the rights under the relevant Company Stock Plan or other
Company Plan. Similarly, all Company Stock Plans and other Company Plans (and
awards thereunder) providing for cash payments measured by the value of Shares
shall be deemed to refer to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product determined by multiplying such Shares by the Option Exchange
Ratio, and such cash payments shall otherwise be made on the terms and
conditions applicable under the relevant Company Stock Plan or other
Company Plan.

(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, if
registration of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under a Company
Stock Plan or other Company Plan is required under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8,
as the case may be (or any successor form), or another appropriate form with
respect to such Parent Common Stock and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon
as practicable following such filing.

 



-10- (g) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.5. Parent shall
take all actions as are reasonably necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Plans pursuant to this Section 4.5. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
Surviving Company will not be bound at the Effective Time by any options,
stock appreciation rights, units or other rights, awards or arrangements under
the Company Stock Plans that would entitle any Person after the Effective Time
to beneficially own any Shares or to receive any payments in respect thereof,
and all Company Stock Plans conferring any rights to Shares or other capital
stock of the Company shall be deemed to be amended to be in conformity with
this Section 4.5.

requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to
vote on such matter at a meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the "
_Company Requisite Vote_ "). This Agreement has been

 



-14-  duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). As of the date of this Agreement

Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of the Shares in the Merger
is fair to such holders from a financial point of view, as of the date of
such opinion, and (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption. The Board of Directors of the Company
has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested stockholder"
or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with
the Company (in each case, as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as
a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions in the manner contemplated hereby.

transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Companys Third Amended and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license,

or any of its Subsidiaries, or, assuming (solely with respect to performance
of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) the filings, notices, reports, consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations referred
to in this Section 5.1(d) are made or obtained and receipt of the Company
Requisite Vote, under any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations under any Contracts
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the
case of clauses (B) and (C) above, for any such breach, violation, default,
termination, payment, acceleration, creation or change that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Specified Subsidiaries" shall mean DIRECTV Holdings LLC, DIRECTV Financing
Co., and any direct or indirect non-wholly Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) The Company has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
December 31, 2012 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports
and documents filed with or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and
those filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the

 



-16-  date of this Agreement, in each case as amended, the " _Company Reports_ ").
Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished
complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company
Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did
not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to
the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ. Except

nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material
way) any extension of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive
officer or director of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Affiliate_ " when used with respect to any party shall mean any Person who
is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act.

 

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with
the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial
reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed,
based on the most recent evaluation of its Chief Executive Officer and its
Chief Financial Officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for the Companys auditors and audit committee
of the Companys Board of Directors any material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent (I) a summary of any such disclosure made by management of
the Company to its auditors and audit committee on or after January 1, 2014
and prior to the date of this Agreement and (II) any material communication
on or after January 1, 2014 and prior to the date of this Agreement made

professional standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. On
and after January 1, 2014 and prior to the date of this Agreement, no material
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters or compliance with Law, including from Company Employees
regarding questionable accounting, auditing or legal compliance matters have,
to the Knowledge of the Company, been received by the Company.

 

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and

date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity (deficit) included
in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in each
case, in all material respects, the results of operations, retained earnings
(loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that
will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein or in the notes thereto.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2013 and through the

circumstance or development which has had or would, individually or in the

Company or (2) by Sky Brasil Servicios Ltda. and (y) any repurchases of Shares
pursuant to the Companys share repurchase program); (iv) the Company and

with past

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no civil, criminal
or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations,
investigations or other proceedings, pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no obligations or
liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise other than (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed, reflected, reserved against or
otherwise provided for in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of

order, writ, injunction, decree, award, stipulation or settlement of or with
any Governmental Entity that would reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (except to the extent
expressly consented to by Parent pursuant to Section 6.5).

(h) _Employee Benefits_. (i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Company Plan_ " shall mean any benefit and compensation plan, contract,
policy, program or arrangement maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries covering current or former employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") and current or
former directors of the Company, including "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and any incentive and bonus, deferred
compensation, stock purchase, employment, retention severance, termination,
change in control, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation rights
or stock based plans, and the Company Plans maintained outside of the United
States primarily for the benefit of Company Employees working outside of the
United States are hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans._ " Each material Company Plan, other than the Company Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans, is listed in Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
each such Company Plan which has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service (the

 



-19-  " _IRS_ ") National Office has been separately identified. True and complete
copies of each of the material Company Plans (or a written summary of any
unwritten Company Plans), including any trust agreement or insurance contract
forming a part of such Company Plans, and all amendments thereto, have been
provided or made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(ii) All Company Plans, other than the Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans
(collectively, " _Company U.S. Benefit Plans_ "), are in material compliance
with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each Company U.S. Benefit Plan
which is subject to ERISA (a " _Company ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "
_Company Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, circumstances do not exist that are likely to
result in the loss of the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits under a Company U.S.
Benefit Plan has (A) received an opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its
exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (B) filed a timely
notice with the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and the Company
is not aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of such exempt
status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company ERISA
Plan that, assuming the Taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date of this Agreement, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a
material Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502(i) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
or reasonably expects to incur a material Tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under
Section 4071 of ERISA.

(iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code (a " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ "), except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). No notice of
a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which
the reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant
to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") Reg. Section 4043.33 or
4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Company Pension Plan or by any
Company ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date of this
Agreement. No notices have been required to be sent to participants and
beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

 



-20- (iv) All contributions required to be made under each Company Plan, as of the
date of this Agreement, have been timely made and all obligations in respect
of each Company Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most
recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the
Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither any Company
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Company ERISA
Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Company Pension Plan
nor any single-employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate has been required to
file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most
recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated that required
minimum contributions to any Company Pension Plan under Section 412 of the
Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Company Pension Plan or to any single-
employer plan of a Company ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code.

(v) Under each Company Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date of this
Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
Company Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the
then current value of the assets of such Company Pension Plan, and there has
been no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a
result of a change in funding method, of such Company Pension Plan since the
last day of the most recent plan year.

(vi) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the Company Plans,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries have any obligations for retiree health or life benefits under
any of the Company ERISA Plans or any collective bargaining agreement, except
as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA.

(vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to any of the Company U.S. Benefit Plans that would
result in a material increase in liabilities to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of
this Agreement, receipt of approval or clearance from any one or more
Governmental Entities of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby will (A) entitle any employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date of this Agreement, (B) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or 

 



-21-  funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Company Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans or (D) result in
payments under any of the Company Plans which would not be deductible under
Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

(viii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any taxes,
interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Sections 409A, 280G or 4999 of the
Code or otherwise.

 

(ix) All of the material Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed in Section
5.1(h)(ix) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which includes each Company
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or a plan that
provides benefits pursuant to a formula that requires benefits to be funded
based on actuarial principles. All of the material Company Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans comply in all material respects with applicable local Law (including
compliance with any applicable requirements with respect to registration and
good standing with regulatory authorities) and is approved by any applicable
taxation authorities for favorable taxation status to the extent such
approval is available (and, to the Knowledge of the Company, circumstances do
not exist that are reasonably likely to cause such approval to cease to
apply), the Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded
liabilities with respect to any such Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans that are
not set forth in the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, to the extent required by GAAP, and as of the date of this
Agreement, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
material litigation relating to the Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

 

(x) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with
applicable Laws that require amounts to be withheld, informed and/or
paid with respect to earnings, salaries and other payments to employees,
including applicable withholding Taxes, health and social security
contributions and pension contributions. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
no material liability by reason of an individual who performs or performed
services for the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in any capacity being
improperly excluded from participating in a Company Plan; and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each of the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been properly classified by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under applicable Law in all material respects.

 

(i) _Labor Matters_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by work rules or a
collective bargaining agreement or other similar Contract with a labor union
or labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the
subject of any proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor

 



-22-  practice or is seeking to compel the Company to bargain with any labor union
or labor organization nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, nor has there been since January 1, 2009 and prior to
the date of this Agreement, any labor strike, walkout, work stoppage, slow-
down or lockout involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. On and after
the date of this Agreement, there has been no labor strike, walkout, work
stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of
this Agreement, none of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is represented by a labor union, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of
a collective bargaining unit being made or threatened involving employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is, and has been since
January 1, 2010 in compliance with all applicable Laws governing employment or
labor, including all contractual commitments and all such Laws relating to
wages, hours, worker classification, contractors, immigration, collective
bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers
compensation except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company does not
have any material requirement under Contract or Law to provide notice to, or
to enter into any consultation procedure with, any labor union or
other organization in connection with the execution of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(j) _Company Satellite Systems_. (i) Set forth on Section 5.1(j)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter is a true and complete list, as of the date of this
Agreement, of each satellite (A) owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not in orbit, (B) on which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries now leases or has the right to lease capacity or (C) in
production which is or will be owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or will
have a right to use any capacity (each, a " _Company Satellite_ "), listing
each Company Satellite by its owner, current and any other authorized orbital
location, and, if the Company Satellite is in production, the anticipated
launch date and expected lifetime. Also set forth on Section 5.1(j)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, for each Company Satellite currently in operation,
the Company shall provide a true and complete list, as of the date of this
Agreement, of the orbital maneuver life of such Company Satellite considering
all anomalies described in the Health Status Reports. The Company has made
available to Parent true and correct copies of the most recent health status
reports with respect to each Company Satellite providing a cumulative record
detailing its health and performance, any satellite-related incidents and
anomalies, any information from the satellite manufacturer relating
to potential health and performance and any information relating to
degradation of performance with respect to satellite service life as of the
dates of each such report (collectively from January 1, 2013 through the date
hereof, the " _Health Status Reports_ "), and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, each Health Status Report is accurate. Except as described in the
Health Status Reports, to the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no satellite-related incidents or anomalies experienced

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign legal
entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing,
or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has made available to the Company
complete and correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of
Parent and the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub, in each case as amended to and in effect on the date
of this Agreement.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means
(A) an effect that would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, or (B) a material
adverse effect on

 



-35-  the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or
results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
excluding any such effect resulting from or arising in connection with (1)
changes in the financial or securities markets or general economic or
political conditions in the U.S. or any foreign jurisdiction in which Parent
operates, including any changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates,
monetary policy or inflation, (2) any acts of war, sabotage, civil
disobedience or terrorism or natural disasters (including hurricanes,
tornadoes, floods or earthquakes), (3) any failure by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections,
forecasts or predictions in respect of financial performance for any period,
(4) a decline in the price of the shares of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE,
_provided_ that the exception in clauses (3) and (4) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, (5) changes in Law, (6) changes in U.S. GAAP
(or authoritative interpretation of GAAP) or (7) the taking of any specific
action expressly required by, or the failure to take any specific action
expressly prohibited by, this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
changes, effects, circumstances or developments set forth in the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (5) shall be taken into account in determining whether a
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" has occurred to the extent such changes,
effects, circumstances or developments have a disproportionate adverse effect
on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to all other
participants in the industries in which Parent and its Subsidiaries operate,
but, in such event, only the incremental disproportionate impact of such
changes, effects, circumstances or developments shall be taken into account in
determining whether a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" has occurred.

 

(b) _Capital Structure_. (i) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized
capital stock of Parent consists of (A) 14,000,000,000 shares of Parent
Common Stock, of which 5,190,509,146 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued
and outstanding as of the close of business on May 15, 2014, and (B)
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "
_Parent Preferred Stock_ "), of which no shares of Parent Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and no other shares of
Parent Common Stock or shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding on such date. All of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
and Parent Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable. Section 5.2(b)(i) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter contains a correct and complete list as of May 15, 2014 of (x) the
outstanding number of options to purchase Parent Common Stock (each, a "
_Parent Option_ ") pursuant to certain of Parents compensation and benefit
plans (such compensation and benefit plans, the " _Parent Stock Plans_ ") and
(y) the outstanding number of rights to receive Parent Common Stock (pursuant
to deferred shares, performance shares and restricted stock units) under the
Parent Stock Plans (each a " _Parent Common Stock Unit_ "). From May 15, 2014
to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has not issued any Parent Common
Stock except pursuant to the exercise of Parent Options and the settlement of
Parent Common Stock Units outstanding on May 15, 2014 in accordance with their
terms and, since May 15, 2014 to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
not issued any Parent 

 



-36-  Options or Parent Common Stock Units. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind
that obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of Parent or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, any equity securities of Parent, and no securities or
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Parent does not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any matter.

the Effective Time will be, owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, and

prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective
Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other
than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub
is a disregarded entity that is treated as a division of Parent for federal
income tax purposes under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3.

(c)  _Corporate Authority; Approval_. Parent and Merger Sub each have all
requisite corporate power and authority and each has taken all corporate
action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception. The shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Stock
Consideration have been duly authorized and, when issued pursuant to this
Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no
stockholder of Parent will have any preemptive right of subscription or
purchase in respect thereof. No approval by the stockholders of Parent is
required in order for Parent to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

(d)  _Governmental Filings; No Violations_. (i) Other than the necessary

obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity, in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, except, in each case, those that the
failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, (B) with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, a breach or violation of, a

assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract binding
upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or, assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) the filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations referred to in this Section 5.2(d)(i) are made or obtained,
under any Law to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any
change in the rights or obligations under any Contracts to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C)
above, for any such breach, violation, default, termination, payment,
acceleration, creation or change that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) Parent has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with or to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
the Applicable Date (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed with
or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, in each case as
amended, the " _Parent Reports_ "). Each of the Parent Reports, at the time
of its filing or being furnished, complied or, if not yet filed or furnished,
will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange 

 



-38-  Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Parent Reports. As of their respective dates (or,
if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(ii) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

(iii) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Parent is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of Parents filings with the SEC
and other public disclosure documents. Parent maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective
in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the audit

the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for
Parents auditors and audit committee of Parents Board of Directors any
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting.

reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)

Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
changes in stockholders equity (deficit) included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date of
this Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material respects,
the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods
set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto.

 



-39- (f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2013 and through the date
of this Agreement, (i) there has not been any change, effect, circumstance or
development which has had or would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) Parent and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary
course of such businesses consistent with past practice in all material
respects; and (iii) except for normal quarterly cash dividends in an amount
equal to $0.46 per share of Parent Common Stock, Parent has not declared, set
aside or paid any dividend or distribution payable in cash, stock or property
in respect of any capital stock.

 

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings, pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. There are no obligations or liabilities, whether or
not accrued, contingent or otherwise other than (i) liabilities or obligations
disclosed, reflected, reserved against or otherwise provided for in the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent as of December 31, 2013 and the notes
thereto set forth in Parents annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2013; (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred since
December 31, 2013; (iii) liabilities or obligations arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) liabilities or
obligations that would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree, award, stipulation or settlement of or with
any Governmental Entity that would reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Knowledge of Parent" means the actual knowledge of the
individuals identified on Section 5.2(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

(h) _Employee Benefits_. All contributions required to be made under each
Parent Pension Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made
and all obligations in respect of each Parent Pension Plan have been properly
accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Parent Reports prior to the date of this
Agreement. Under each Parent Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as
of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date of this
Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Parent
Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the
then current value of the assets of such Parent Pension Plan, and there has
been no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result
of a change in funding method, of such Parent Pension Plan 

 



-40-  since the last day of the most recent plan year. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Pension Plan_ " means any benefit plan maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which is
subject to ERISA and is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA.

 

(i) _Compliance with Laws, Licenses_. The businesses of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010 have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any applicable Law, except for such violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the
date herof, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor has
any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for
such investigations or reviews the outcome of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(j) _Takeover Statutes_. No Takeover Statute or any anti-takeover provision in
Parents restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws is, or at the
Effective Time will be, applicable to the Parent Common Stock, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement except that Parent has employed Lazard Freres and Co. LLC as its
financial advisor.

 

(l) _Reorganization_. Parent has not taken or agreed to take any action, and
is not aware of any facts or circumstances, in each case, that would prevent
or impede, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

(m) _Available Funds_. Parent and Merger Sub have available to them, or as of
the Effective Time will have available to them, all funds necessary for the
payment to the Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration.

(n) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Section 5.2, Parent
and Merger Sub are not making and have not made, and no other Person is making
or has made on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, any express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with this Agreement or the

(d) The Company agrees to take the actions and comply with the requirements

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals._

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of its or its Subsidiaries officers and directors shall,

any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person

Company or any of its Subsidiaries and promptly terminate all physical and
electronic data access previously granted to such Person.

 

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 6.2(a), prior to the time, but not after,
the Company

 



-47-  Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited,
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (i)
provide access to non-public information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, providing for
the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated
basis) or total voting power or economic interests of the equity securities
of the Company, so long as, in the case of a transaction which is not all
cash, the holders of the Companys equity securities (including Shares) would
not receive in the aggregate more than 65% of the total voting power of the
equity securities of the issuer that is issuing securities in the transaction
or 70% of the economic value of the issuer that is issuing securities in the
transaction, in each case as measured based on the securities of such issuer
outstanding at the time of the making of such Acquisition Proposal and giving
effect to all securities and other consideration proposed to be issued by such
issuer in such transaction, provided that such information has previously
been, or is substantially concurrently, made available to Parent and that,
prior to furnishing any such non-public information, the Company receives from
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such
Person as the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7) (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not, at the Companys
discretion, prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition Proposal); and
(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such
Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking
any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or could be reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.

(c) _Notice_. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
notify Parent if (i) any written or other bona fide inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) any non-
public information is requested in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
from, or (iii) any discussions or negotiation with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, it, its Subsidiaries or

notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys
intentions as previously notified.

 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer from any Person or
group of Persons, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, spin-off, extraordinary
dividend, share exchange, business combination or 

 



-48-  similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
is structured to permit such Person or group of Persons to, directly or
indirectly, acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Companys
consolidated total assets or any class of the Companys equity interests and
(ii) any acquisition by any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent and
its Subsidiaries) resulting in, or proposal or offer, which if consummated
would result in, any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) obtaining control (through Contract or otherwise) over or
becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series
of related transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power of any class
of equity securities of the Company, or 15% or more of the consolidated total
assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in
each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal involving the acquisition by a Person or a group of Persons, other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries, of all or substantially all of the assets
(on a consolidated basis) or total voting power of the equity securities of
the Company (in each case measured based on the participation of the existing
stockholders of the Company in the successor Person of the Company (which may
be the Company)), so long as, in the case of a transaction which is not all
cash, the holders of the Companys equity securities (including Shares) would
not receive in the aggregate more than 65% of the total voting power of the
equity securities of the issuer that is issuing securities in the transaction
or 70% of the economic value of the issuer that is issuing securities and
other consideration in the transaction, in each case as measured based on the
securities of such issuer outstanding at the time of the making of such
Acquisition Proposal and giving effect to all securities proposed to
be issued by such issuer in such transaction, that its Board of Directors has
determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated
and, if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the
terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.2(f) of this Agreement).

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as provided in Section 6.2(f), the Board of Directors of the Company and each
committee of the Board of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (it being
understood that publicly taking a neutral position or no position with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal at any time beyond ten business days after the
first public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal by the Company or by
the party which made the Acquisition Proposal shall be considered a
modification adverse to Parent) or make or authorize the making of any
statement (oral or written) that has the substantive effect of such a
withdrawal, qualification or modification; (ii) cause or permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture 

 



-49-  agreement, partnership agreement, lease agreement or other agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(b) entered into in
compliance with Section 6.2(b)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")
relating to any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose to enter into an Acquisition Proposal or an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 

(f) _Fiduciary Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, (x) the
Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify
the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Superior Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that
did not result from a material breach of this Agreement, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ", it being
understood that a customary "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance
with Rule 14d-9(f) of the 1934 Act shall not, in and of itself, constitute a
Change in Recommendation) and/or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Section 8.3(b) and concurrent with such termination cause
the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Agreement
(a " _Superior Proposal Termination_ "); _provided_ that in no event shall
the Company take, or agree or resolve to take, any action other than in
compliance with this Section 6.2; _provided_ _further_ that no Change in
Recommendation and/or Superior Proposal Termination may be made until after
at least five business days (or such shorter time period if the Company
Stockholders Meeting is held within such five business day period) following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising that the
Companys Board of Directors intends to take such action and the basis
therefor, including all information required to be provided under Section
6.2(c) and in the case of a Change in Recommendation not related to a
Superior Proposal, all material information related thereto. After providing
such notice and prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation and/or
Superior Proposal Termination, (i) the Company shall, during such five
business day period (or such shorter time period if the Company Stockholders
Meeting is held within such five business day period), negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms
of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement proposed by Parent, and (ii)
in determining whether to make a Change in Recommendation and/or effect a
Superior Proposal Termination, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice
during such five business day period (or such shorter time period if the
Company Stockholders Meeting is held within such five business day
period). Any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.2(f), including with respect to the notice period
referred to in this Section 6.2(f), except that the five business day period
(or such shorter time period if the Company Stockholders

 



-50-  Meeting is held within such five business day period) shall be three
business days (or such shorter time period if the Company Stockholders Meeting
is held within such three business day period) for such purposes.

(g) _Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality_. From the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreement, including by seeking injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to fail to enforce any
provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation of any
Person if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action is necessary in order for the directors to comply with their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the Company promptly
advises Parent that it is taking such action and the identity of the party or
parties with respect to which it is taking such action; provided further that
the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a Person to
orally request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation to the
extent necessary to comply with fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ that, if such disclosure has the effect or
substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, qualifying or modifying the
Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as
set forth in Section 8.4(b).

6.3. _Information Supplied_. (a) The Company shall promptly prepare and file
with the SEC the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC
by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger (including the proxy statement and prospectus (the "
_Prospectus/Proxy Statement_ ") constituting a part thereof, the " _S-4
Registration Statement_ ") as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company
each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter mail the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company
and Parent shall also use their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy
prior to the effective date of the S-4 Registration Statement all necessary
state securities Law or "blue sky" notice requirements in connection with the
Merger and to consummate the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and will pay all expenses incident thereto.

 



-51- (b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the S-4 Registration
Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement will be made by the Company or
Parent, in each case without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the
other, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by
such other party to be included therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the other in the preparation of the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement and the resolution of any comments
to either received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Requisite Vote, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the S-4 Registration Statement or the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The parties shall notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or
the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the S-4 Registration
Statement. The Company and Parent will cause the S-4 Registration Statement to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. (a) The Company will use, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, its reasonable
best efforts to convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ ") not more than 45 days after the date the S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective. Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.2, the Companys Board of Directors shall recommend in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and at the Company Stockholders Meeting that the
holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
on a date preceding the date on which or the date on which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (i)
it will not receive proxies representing the Company Requisite Vote, whether
or not a quorum is present, or (ii) it will not have enough Shares represented
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one

 



-52-  or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company
Stockholders Meeting as long as the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 15 calendar days in
connection with any postponements or adjournments in reliance on the preceding
sentence. In the event that during the five business days prior to the date
that the Company Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held,
the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make a Change in Recommendation
and/or Superior Proposal Termination (including in connection with an
amendment pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.2(f)), Parent may direct
the Company to postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting for up to five
business days and the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than
the next business day, postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance
with Parents direction.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption
at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by Law to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby)
that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification._

 

(a) _Cooperation_. The Company and Parent shall, subject to Section 6.2,
cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (it being
understood that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent to
obtain any consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of
waiting periods or authorizations prior to the Termination Date), including
preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings (including by
filing no later than 20 calendar days after the date of this Agreement all
applications required to be filed with the FCC and the notification and report
form required under the HSR Act; _provided_ that the failure to file within
such 20-day period shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement) and to
obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent necessary or
advisable to obtain any consent, registration, approval, permit, expiration
of waiting period or authorization from any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Merger prior to the Termination Date, (x) Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and commit to 

 



-53-  cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, take the actions and agree to
those undertakings set forth on Section 6.5(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
and (y) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take, other actions
involving Parent and its Subsidiaries that are in the aggregate de minimis
(for the avoidance of doubt, not involving any divestiture, holding separate
any business or assets or other similar action). Except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, (i) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take or refrain
from taking any action (including any divestiture, holding separate any
business or assets or other similar action) or to agree to any restriction or
condition with respect to any assets, operations, business or the conduct of
business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action
(including any divestiture, holding separate any business or assets or other
similar action) or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect to
any assets, operations, business or the conduct of business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, if, in the case of this clause (ii), any such action,
failure to act, restriction, condition or agreement, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (read without regard to the exceptions set forth therein and without
giving effect to clause (A) thereof) (except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, the occurrence of any of the matters specified in clause
(i) or clause (ii) above shall constitute a " _Regulatory Material Adverse
Effect_ "). In addition, in measuring whether a Regulatory Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, the expected loss of any reasonably expected synergies
(both cost and revenue) relating to any restriction or condition shall be
taken into account as if the Company had an adverse effect to its financial
condition and results of operations equal to the expected amount of
applicable synergies affected by any such restriction or condition. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or
conditions with respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits, expirations of waiting periods or authorizations in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of Parent (which, subject to this Section 6.5(a) may
be withheld in Parents sole discretion). Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
on, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each party shall provide the other with copies of all correspondence between
it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and meetings with a Governmental
Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
include representatives of Parent and the Company. In exercising the
foregoing rights, the Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

 



-54- (b) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement and any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.6. _Access; Consultation_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, afford Parents Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to the
Companys employees, properties, assets, books, records and contracts and,
during such period, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, (x) in the case of Parent, furnish promptly to the
Company information regarding the matters set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter as may reasonably be requested and (y) in the case of
the Company, furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its or any
of their respective Subsidiaries capital stock, business and personnel as
may reasonably be requested; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company or Parent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the foregoing shall neither require the Company nor Parent to permit any
invasive environmental sampling or any inspection, or to disclose any
information, pursuant to this Section 6.6 to the extent that (i) in the
reasonable good faith judgment of such party, any applicable Law requires
such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such
party, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third
party or (iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided, further, that with respect to
clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.6, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the
required consent of any such third party to provide such inspection or
disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company
and (3) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), utilize the procedures of their
existing joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if the
parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.
Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in such
manner as not to interfere

 



-55-  unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other party. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed
to an executive officer of the Company or Parent (as applicable) or such
Person as may be designated by any such executive officer. Each of Parent and
the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel
Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject
to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the
parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the
information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 6.6 or otherwise
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and
mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to,
and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such
material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense
doctrine.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another of
any change, effect, circumstance or development that is reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as applicable), of any failure of any condition to Parents or the Companys
obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable) or of any other change,
effect, circumstance or development which would cause or constitute a breach
of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or
Parent (as applicable) contained herein.

Subsidiaries in connection therewith) and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall provide all assistance reasonably required by Parent in connection with
obtaining the execution of such instruments by the other parties required to

-60- (b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, at Parents expense, after the receipt of a written request from

debentures or other debt securities of DIRECTV Finance on such terms and
conditions as specified and reasonably requested by Parent and in compliance
with all applicable terms and conditions of the applicable indenture (the "
_Debt Offers_ "); provided that (i) Parent shall have provided the Company
with the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related
documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) the closing of
the Debt Offers shall be conditioned on the Closing. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use respective reasonable best efforts to and
to cause their respective representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers, and in connection with
any tender or exchange offers commenced by Parent, and any related consent
solicitations with respect to, any existing indebtedness of DIRECTV Finance.
Parent shall only request the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct any
Debt Offer in compliance in all material respects with the applicable rules

the applicable indenture or other Contract. Parent shall ensure that at the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall have all funds necessary to pay
any consideration required to be paid in connection with the Debt Offers on

take any actions requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for the
payoff, satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance of any existing indebtedness
of DIRECTV Finance, and shall payoff, redeem or satisfy, discharge and/or
defease, as applicable, such indebtedness in accordance with the indenture,
credit agreement, or other Contract governing such indebtedness (the " _Debt
Payoffs_ "), including taking any action reasonably necessary to obtain a
payoff letter in connection therewith; provided that any such action described
above shall not be required unless it can be conditioned on the occurrence of
the Closing, and, it being understood that at Closing, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the appropriate trustee, agent or other
recipient, cash or cash equivalents sufficient to actually effect such payoff,
redemption, satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance. The Company shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to and to cause their respective representatives to, provide
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any Debt Payoff.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
Section 6.16(c) shall not create any independent conditions to Closing.

received, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee or
agent to) execute a supplemental indenture or amendment to the

 



-61-  applicable indenture or other Contract governing such indebtedness, which
shall implement the amendments described in the Offer Documents, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the
Debt Offers) and the applicable indenture or other Contract; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors or other representatives, have any
obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any supplemental indenture or other
agreement that would become effective prior to the Closing. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Offer, concurrently with the Closing, Parent

promptly pay for, any indebtedness that has been validly tendered pursuant to
and in accordance with the Debt Offers and not properly withdrawn using funds

with each other in the preparation of any Offer Documents or other
appropriate documents. The Company shall, to the extent requested, keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding the status, results and timing of the Debt
Offers. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, such party that discovers such information shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to the holders of the applicable indebtedness of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.16(e), the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other Law to the extent applicable

one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other
agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements with such parties
so selected; provided, that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless, or pay the fees or
reimburse the costs and expenses of, any such party, which indemnification,
fee and reimbursement obligations shall be borne by Parent pursuant to
separate agreements with such parties to which neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be a party or have any obligations under.

representatives (including their auditors) to, use its respective reasonable
best efforts to provide all customary cooperation (including providing

its Subsidiaries for use in marketing and offering documents and to enable
Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) as reasonably requested by
Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement of any bank debt financing or any
capital markets debt financing for the purposes of financing the payment of
the Cash Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by
this Agreement or required in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other amounts required to
be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger; provided, however,
that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under such bank
debt financing or any capital markets debt financing shall be effective prior
to the Closing.

 

(h) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered

not the Merger is consummated or this Agreement is terminated. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.16,
whether or not the Merger is consummated or this Agreement is terminated.

after the date of adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company referred to in Section 7.1(a); _provided_ that, (i) if either the
Company or Parent determines that additional time is necessary in connection
with obtaining a Required Governmental Consent from the FCC or any PUC listed
in Section 7.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and foreign Governmental
Entities listed in Section 7.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
in connection with the expiration of the waiting period pursuant to the HSR
Act, the Termination Date may be extended by either Parent or the Company from
time to time by written notice to the other up to a date not beyond August 17,
2015 and (ii) if the Termination Date has been

 



-67-  extended to August 17, 2015, the Termination Date may be extended further by
the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company from time to time up to
a date not beyond November 13, 2015, which date or dates pursuant to clauses
(i) or (ii) of this Section 8.2, as extended from time to time, shall
thereafter be deemed to be the Termination Date, (b) the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a)
shall not have occurred at a meeting duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement was taken, (c) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-
appealable, whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a), _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall not
be available to any party that has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
contributed to the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or (d) the FCC
adopts a hearing designation order in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

8.3. _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned (a) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company referred to in Section 7.1(a), by action of the Board of Directors of
the Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, such that Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied
and such breach or failure to be true is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured by the 30th day following notice to Parent from the Company of such
breach or failure; provided, that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3 if the Company is then
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement or (b) at any time prior to the Company
Requisite Vote being obtained, (i) if the Board of Directors of the Company
authorizes the Company, subject to complying with the terms of Section 6.2, to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Agreement, (ii)
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of Section 6.2, enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal that did not result
from a material breach of this Agreement and (iii) prior to or concurrently
with such termination, the Company pays to Parent in immediately available
funds any fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.5(b), subject to and
in accordance with Section 8.5(c).

8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of
the Board of Directors of Parent if (a) the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have made a Change in Recommendation prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a),
or (b) whether before or after

 



-68-  the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company referred
to in Section 7.1(a), there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and such
breach or failure to be true is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by
the 30th day following notice to the Company of such breach or failure;
provided, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) if Parent is then in material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement.

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII, this Agreement (other than as set forth in this Section 8.5 and in
Section 9.1) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part
of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives); _provided_ that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for damages
to any other party resulting from any prior willful breach of this Agreement
or from any obligation to pay, if applicable, the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.5(b).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a)
(Change in Recommendation) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to either (x)
Section 8.2(b) (Stockholder Vote) at a time when Parent had the right to
terminate pursuant to Section 8.4(a) (Change in Recommendation) or (y)
Section 8.3(b) (Termination for Superior Proposal), then the Company shall,
within two business days after such termination in the case of clause (i) or
concurrently with such termination in the case of clause (ii) be obligated to
pay Parent a fee equal to $1,445,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). In
addition, if (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (Termination Date) or 8.2(b) (Stockholder Vote) or
(B) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b) (Company Breach), (ii) prior to such
termination referred to in clause (i), but after the date of this Agreement, a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or shall have been made directly to the Companys
stockholders generally or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company (a " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ ");
and (iii) within 12 months after the date of a termination in either of the
cases referred to in clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) of this Section 8.5(b), the
Company consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal or enters into an agreement
contemplating a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee concurrently with such entry or
consummation; _provided_ that solely for purposes of this Section 8.5(b)(iii),
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 6.2(d), except that the references to "15% or more" shall be
deemed to be references to "50% or more". The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly the amount

 



-69-  due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b), the Company shall pay
to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment should
have been made. At the time the Termination Fee is paid by the Company, the
Company shall concurrently give to Parent wire instructions in the event of a
refund of the Termination Fee.

 

(c) In the event that a Termination Fee is paid pursuant to clause (i) of the
first sentence of Section 8.5(b), Parent shall have the right, exercisable by
written notice to the Company within one business day after the receipt of
payment of such Termination Fee, to refund such Termination Fee to the
Company, and in that event that the Company actually receives a full
refund of the entire Termination Fee within two business days after the
delivery of such notice, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled
to all remedies available as contemplated by Section 8.5(a). In the event that
a Termination Fee is paid pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of
Section 8.5(b) or the second sentence of Section 8.5(b), Parent shall have the
right, exercisable by written notice to the Company within two business days
after the receipt of such Termination Fee, to refund such Termination Fee to
the Company, and in the event that the Company actually receives a full refund
of the entire Termination Fee within two business days after the delivery of
such notice, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to all
remedies available as contemplated by Section 8.5(a). If, after receiving the
Termination Fee, Parent fails to exercise its right to refund the Termination
Fee in accordance with the time periods provided for in this Section 8.5(c),
Parent shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived such right and the Company
shall have no further liability to Parent or Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall have no further liabilities to the Company, under this Agreement
except as set forth in Section 9.1. The parties agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

party to receive such notice as provided above.

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter), the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 27, 2014, between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the Employee Matters
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, other than (a) as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) and (b) the right of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing.

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision negotiated in good faith by the parties hereto shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not, subject to clause (a) above, be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, except as a result of such
substitution, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

 

9.11. _Interpretation_. (a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and
paragraph headings or captions herein are for convenience of reference only,
do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this
Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without 

 



-74-  limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or"
when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. When a reference is made in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter to
information or documents being provided, delivered, made available or
disclosed to Parent, such information or documents shall mean any information
or documents provided in the "Project Star" virtual data room maintained by
the Company or in a "clean room" maintained by the Company and made available
to each of Parent and its Representatives to the extent set forth on Section
9.11(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, in each case, in writing (including
electronically) to Parent or its Representatives, in each case, on or before
May 16, 2014. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms
of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

9.12. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ that Parent may designate, prior to the Effective
Time, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary to be a party to the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in
which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary (except with respect to representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall also be made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that such assignment
shall not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge,
alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
such other Subsidiary. Any assignment in contravention of the preceding
sentence shall be null and void.

 

9.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if

 



-75-  available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof in accordance with Section 9.5
of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that
a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy
of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach or
that the Company or Parent otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.

 



-76- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS AGREEMENT

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS AGREEMENT, dated as of May 18, 2014 (as the same may be
amended from time to time, the "Agreement"), between DIRECTV, a Delaware
corporation (" _DIRECTV_ "), ATandT Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
and Steam Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), each a " _Party_ ," and
collectively, the " _Parties_."

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of DIRECTV and Parent, by
resolutions duly adopted, have approved the merger of DIRECTV with and into
Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_
") and DIRECTV has resolved to recommend to its stockholders the adoption of
the Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, by resolutions duly adopted, has
approved the Merger and the issuance of shares of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of Parent pursuant to the Merger upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Parent seeks to efficiently and effectively integrate the businesses
and employees of DIRECTV as soon as practicable after the Merger in a manner
which maximizes the value of the transaction to shareholders and employees,
and minimizes negative employee relations as well as restraints on post-Merger
flexibility;

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, the Parties are entering into this
Agreement in order to address certain employee compensation and benefit
matters and this Agreement shall be a part of the Merger Agreement (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, subject to the provisions of Article IX thereof); and

 

WHEREAS, this Agreement shall become effective as of the date hereof.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and provisions
hereinafter contained, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 

1\. DEFINITIONS. All initially capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement unless the context
indicates otherwise.

2\. INTERIM OPERATIONS.

 

(a) With respect to Company Employees who are not Senior Executives, from and
after the execution of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Closing Date,
DIRECTV will be permitted to make customary annual base salary, wage piece
rate and/or commission increases including promotions and merit increases in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice not to
exceed 4.0% per year in the aggregate; additionally, DIRECTV will be
permitted to continue to hire additional employees in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with  past practice; provided, however, that DIRECTV may, subject to Parent
Approval (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make customary annual base salary, wage and/or commission increases
for Senior Executives in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practice that are subject to the aggregate maximums set forth above. For
the purposes of this Agreement, " _Senior Executives_ " shall mean Company
Employees with the title of Executive Vice President or above, and " _Parent
Approval_ " shall mean the approval of the Senior Executive Vice President of
Human Resources of Parent.

 

(b) From and after the execution of the Merger Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date, DIRECTV may grant and pay annual bonuses to Company Employees
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, based on
actual performance in accordance with the terms of existing Company Plans as
of the date hereof. The 2015 target cash incentive awards (and any
subsequent pre-Merger cash incentive awards) provided to employees under the
DIRECTV Employee Cash Bonus Plan will be pro-rated based on completed months
of service if involuntarily terminated without cause prior to the end of the
performance period (for the avoidance of doubt, if the employee is entitled
to a bonus for the current year under such plan, the employee will only
receive one such bonus payment and will not receive a duplicate bonus payment
because of a pro-rata provision in another Company plan covering annual cash
bonuses).

(c) From and after the execution of the Merger Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date, DIRECTV may grant long-term equity awards to Company Employees
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, provided
that (i) the annualized grant date value of such awards shall not exceed 105%
of aggregate target equity awards granted in the twelve (12) months prior to
the date hereof, including the grant value of any outstanding stock grant
cancelations during the period, (ii) the grant date value of awards to each
Senior Executive shall not exceed the grant date value of the long-term
equity awards granted to such person in 2014 prior to the date hereof and
(iii) no award granted pursuant to this provision shall vest or pay out on an
accelerated basis solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and the 2015-2017 RSU grants (and any subsequent pre-Merger
RSU grants) will be pro-rated based on completed months of service if
involuntarily terminated without cause prior to the end of the performance
period (for the avoidance of doubt, the proration of any such award(s) will
be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any treatment upon termination of
employment that would otherwise apply to such grant(s) under other Company
Plans).

 

(d) DIRECTV may establish a retention pool in accordance with the terms of the
plan set forth on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter of the
Merger Agreement.

3\. EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, through December 31 of the calendar year following the
Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Company Employees will be
provided with (i) salary, base compensation, annual short term cash incentive
target opportunities, long term equity award target opportunities, and
employee benefits (including pension, 401(k) and retiree medical benefits)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those currently provided
by DIRECTV and its Subsidiaries to such employees as of the date hereof.

 



2 (b) Parent shall or shall cause Merger Sub to (i) for 24 months after the
Effective Time, continue in effect in accordance with its terms, each of the
DIRECTV Executive Severance Plan and the DIRECTV Chief Executive Officer
Severance Plan, each as in effect as of the date hereof and (ii) during the
Continuation Period, continue in effect in accordance with its terms, the
DIRECTV Severance Plan as in effect as of the date hereof.

(c) Parent shall or shall cause Merger Sub to provide that no pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to Company Employees
under the benefit plans provided for those employees except to the extent such
condition or exclusion was applicable to an individual Company Employee prior
to the Closing Date. When administratively practicable, Parent will transition
Company Employees to applicable health and welfare plans of Parent at the
start of the new plan year. Otherwise, with respect to the plan year during
which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall provide each Company Employee with
credit, or a cash payment (on a tax neutral basis) in lieu thereof, for
deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the Closing Date
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
any Parent plan in which such Company Employee is eligible to participate
following the Closing Date.

 

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause Merger Sub
and any successors to, provide credit (without duplication) to Company
Employees for their service recognized by DIRECTV and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting (e.g. pension and 401(k)),
continuous service, determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off,
and severance entitlements and eligibility to retire under applicable Parent
plans to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was
credited under the Company Plans, provided, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits for the same period of service, for purposes of any frozen or
discontinued Parent plan or any frozen or discontinued portion of a Parent
plan or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or retiree medical plan, and provided further, that if "hire date" is
used to determine the particular Parent plan or benefit structure in which a
Company Employee would participate, if any, then "hire date," solely for such
purposes, shall be the Closing Date.

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable
plan, and subject to the continued maintenance of the qualified status of each
plan, Parent may take action necessary to merge the DIRECTV 401(k) Savings
Plan (including outstanding loan balances) into the Parent 401(k)
plan, subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to commence Company Employees participation in Parents 401(k)
plan after the Effective Time.

other employees statutorily exempt from collective bargaining, with respect to
any Company

 



3  Employee who becomes subject to a collective bargaining agreement after the
Effective Time, all compensation and benefits treatment (as well as all terms
and conditions of employment) afforded to such Company Employee shall be
provided only in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining
agreement (and shall no longer be covered by this Agreement).

to this Agreement, and neither any union nor any current or former employee,

limit the ability of Parent or DIRECTV to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; provided that with respect to clause (ii), any actual amendment,
