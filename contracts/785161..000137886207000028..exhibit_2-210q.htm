Calculations.

  

(i) Seller shall, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the

hereinafter defined) of the Division as of the Effective Time (the "Estimated
Net Working Capital") and (C) Closing Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined) of

and its representatives shall have an opportunity to review and comment

  



  

3

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

upon the Good Faith Statement. As used herein, "Closing Cash Balance" shall
mean an amount equal to Unrestricted Cash, calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. As used herein, "Net Working Capital" shall mean (i)
the sum of (A) accounts receivable, net of reserves for doubtful accounts (but
excluding any intercompany accounts receivable) and (B) other current assets
of the type included in the line items set forth on _Schedule III_ (but
excluding any income Tax assets), _less_ (ii) the sum of (A) trade accounts
payable (but excluding any intercompany accounts payable and unapplied cash
and excluding the current portion of any Intercompany Indebtedness), (B)
refunds due to patients and third-party payors, principally as reflected in
account 2512, (C) accrued liabilities (but excluding any intercompany accrued
liabilities and excluding the current portion of long-term Indebtedness and
excluding Distributions accrued by Division Entities and payable to Minority
Interest Holders) and (D) other current liabilities (but excluding (i) any
income Tax liabilities and (ii) any accruals for severance, transaction bonus
payments or change of control payments, in each case in this clause (ii),
arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby), in each case of the
Company and the Division Entities, calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles (but excluding any of the foregoing items relating to
Closed Facilities (as hereinafter defined)). The "Accounting Principles" shall
mean GAAP utilizing the methodologies, accounting principles and practices
used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements (as hereinafter
defined), and as adjusted to derive the 2005 Pro Forma Financial Information,
consistent with the reconciliation thereof set forth in Section 3.7(d) of the
Disclosure Letter, and the Year-End Pro Forma Financial Statements. Net
Working Capital shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the example
thereof set forth in _Schedule III_ hereto, which _Schedule III_ is derived
from the December 31, 2005, June 30, 2006, September 30, 2006 and December 31,
2006 pro forma balance sheets of the Division. As used herein, "Closing
Indebtedness" shall mean an amount equal to Indebtedness (other than
Intercompany Indebtedness) of the Company and the Division Entities as of the
Effective Time (prior to giving account to any Indebtedness incurred in
connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing).

  

(ii) Within ninety (90) days after the end of the calendar quarter in
which the Closing Date occurs, **** Seller **** shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Statement") setting forth (A) the Closing
Cash Balance of the Division as of the Effective Time (the "Actual Closing
Cash Balance"), (B) the Net Working Capital of the Division as of the
Effective Time (the "Actual Net Working Capital") and (C) the Closing
Indebtedness (the "Actual Closing Indebtedness") and, in each case, setting
forth the components and calculations thereof. The Statement shall also set
forth (i) the difference, if any, determined by subtracting the Estimated
Closing Cash Balance from the Actual Closing Cash Balance (any such
difference, the "Cash Adjustment Amount"), it being understood that the Cash
Adjustment Amount may be either a positive or negative number, and (ii) the
difference, if any, determined by subtracting the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness from the Actual Closing Indebtedness (any such difference, the
"Indebtedness Adjustment Amount"), it being understood that the

  



  

4

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

Indebtedness Adjustment Amount may be either a positive or negative number.
Subject to Sections 1.6(a)(iii)-(v), (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount
of any positive Cash Adjustment Amount, and any negative Indebtedness
Adjustment Amount, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any
negative Cash Adjustment Amount and any positive Indebtedness Adjustment
Amount, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.6(a).
Furthermore, the Statement shall set forth a calculation of the amounts that
would have been paid pursuant to Sections 1.2(iii) and 1.2(iv) at the Closing
and the amounts that would have been paid had the Actual Net Working Capital
been used in the calculations in place of the Target Net Working Capital, and
Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as appropriate, an
amount that places the parties in the same position as would have obtained
had the Actual Net Working Capital been so used at Closing (the "Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount"), as finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.6(a). Subject to Section 1.6(a)(iii), to the extent that netting the
payments referenced in the preceding two sentences results in a net payment by
Buyer to Seller, the amount of such net payment shall be referred to herein as
the "Excess Amount" and, to the extent that netting the payments referenced in
the preceding sentence results in a net payment by Seller to Buyer, the amount
of such net payment shall be referred to herein as the "Deficiency Amount."
Contemporaneously with its delivery to Buyer of the Statement, Seller shall
also deliver to Buyer a copy of the work papers prepared in connection with
the Statement\'s preparation and shall provide Buyer and its representatives
reasonable access to all personnel, books and records of or related to the
Division within Seller\'s direction or control as reasonably requested by
Buyer to assist in its review of the Statement. Buyer shall provide Seller and
its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours of Buyer,
to all personnel, books and records of or related to the Division within
Buyer\'s direction or control as reasonably requested by Seller to assist it
in its preparation of the Statement.

  

(iii) After receipt of the Statement, Buyer shall have sixty (60) days
to review the Statement together with the work papers used in its preparation.
The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the sixty-
first day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives written notice
of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Seller prior to such date.
Any Notice of Disagreement shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the nature
and amount of any disagreement so asserted, and (B) include Buyer\'s
calculation of the Actual Closing Cash Balance, Actual Net Working Capital
and/or Actual Closing Indebtedness (whichever is being disputed). The
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the date the
parties hereto resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
any matter relating to Actual Net Working Capital, the Actual Closing Cash
Balance and/or Actual Closing Indebtedness, to the extent properly included in
the Notice of Disagreement, in accordance with this Section 1.6(a). During the
thirty (30) days immediately following the receipt by Seller of a Notice of
Disagreement, the respective Chief Financial Officers of Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed items timely included in
a Notice

  



  

5

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

of Disagreement. During such period, Seller shall have full access to the
working papers of Buyer prepared in connection with Buyer\'s preparation of
the Notice of Disagreement. Any resolution of disputed items included in the
Notice of Disagreement that is agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller
shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Seller, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates. At the end of such thirty (30) day period, at the
request of Seller or Buyer, any and all matters which remain in dispute, and
which were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement, shall be submitted
to a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting firm
(the "Accounting Firm") selected by Seller and Buyer, with no material
relationship to Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, for a
binding resolution of such disputed items. If Buyer and Seller are not
able to agree upon an Accounting Firm, the appointment of an Accounting Firm
will be finally selected by mutual agreement of an independent accounting firm
selected by Seller and an independent accounting firm selected by Buyer;
provided that, neither of the independent accounting firms selected by Buyer
or Seller shall serve as the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in proportion to the amount
by which their respective determinations of the Actual Closing Cash Balance,
Actual Net Working Capital and/or Actual Closing Indebtedness (whichever is
being disputed) differed from the amount determined by the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting
Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the
Statement and the Cash Adjustment Amount, Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount and/or Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, as applicable.

  

(iv) The Accounting Firm shall determine and report in writing to
Seller and Buyer as to its determination of all disputed matters submitted to
the Accounting Firm and the effect of such determinations on the Statement
within thirty (30) Business Days after such submission, and such
determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Seller, Buyer and
their respective Affiliates. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting
Firm, acting in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator: (A) shall
limit its review to matters specifically set forth in such Notice of
Disagreement delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(iii) as a disputed item
(other than those items thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of
Seller and Buyer), (B) shall further limit its review to whether the
calculation of any such disputed item is mathematically accurate and has been
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the methodologies
set forth on _Schedule III_ attached hereto, and (C) shall not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any party
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by any other party in
the Statement or the Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(iii). Each of Seller and Buyer shall have the right, within five (5)
Business Days of submission of any disputed item to the Accounting Firm, to
meet with representatives of the Accounting Firm and present its position as
to the resolution of such disputed item. In addition, Seller and Buyer shall
each furnish to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed items, as the Accounting Firm may
reasonably request.

(v) At such time as the Statement becomes final, binding and
conclusive upon Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates in accordance
with this Section 1.6(a), the Statement shall become the "Conclusive
Statement." If the Conclusive Statement contains a Deficiency Amount, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to such Deficiency Amount.
If the Conclusive Statement contains an Excess Amount, then Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount in cash equal to such Excess Amount. Any payment to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) shall be made on the third Business Day
following the date on which the Statement becomes the Conclusive Statement
pursuant to this Section 1.6(a). Any payment required to be made by Seller or
Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.6(a) shall bear interest from the Closing
Date through the date of payment at the Interest Rate (as of the date on which
the Statement becomes the Conclusive Statement) and shall be payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the party entitled to receive such funds prior to the date when such
payment is due.

  

(b) The Initial Purchase Price, as increased by any Excess Amount or
decreased by any Deficiency Amount, as the case may be, shall be subject to
additional adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 1.2 of the Disclosure
Letter, and, as so adjusted, shall be referred to herein as the "Purchase
Price."

other properties, assets and Contracts primarily used in the conduct of the

to be transferred or assigned to the Company or the Division Entities (or

required to be transferred or conveyed pursuant to the Restructuring
Transactions or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
assignable or transferable without the consent of any Person other than
Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, and such consent shall
not have been given prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the continuing
obligation after the Closing to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
endeavor to obtain any such consent and/or to provide Buyer with the benefits
of any such property, asset, Contract or Permit. After the Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable arrangement that is
designed to (i) relieve Seller of the obligations of any such property,
assets, Contracts and Permits that are required to be transferred or conveyed
to the Company or the Division Entities pursuant to the Restructuring
Transactions or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and provide
Buyer the benefits thereunder and (ii) relieve Buyer of the obligations of any
such property, assets, Contracts and Permits that are required to be

obligation or liability under this Agreement.

date hereof and shall keep Seller reasonably informed of any developments
associated therewith. Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
of all Guaranties of Seller. If Buyer is unable to obtain any such

request, and shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Buyer such financial
and operating data and other information with respect to the business and
properties of the Division and of the Captive Insurance Subsidiary (but solely

and Buyer Representatives shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the
reasonable judgment of Seller to schedule such access and visits through only
those specifically identified representatives of Seller and in such a way as
to avoid unreasonably disrupting the normal business of the Company and the
Division Entities; and (ii) Seller, the Company and the Division Entities
shall not be required to supply Buyer with any information to the extent that

any information which it or they receive in connection with the activities and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in

_Antitrust Notification_ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

. Subject to Section 10.2(b) hereof, Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations or waivers
required under the HSR Act to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Ancillary Agreements, including (a) making all Filings with the
Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission (the "Agencies") required in
connection therewith (the initial filing to occur no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement), (b)
responding as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the
Agencies for additional information or documentation, and (c) resolving any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the

taking all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the Agencies or state antitrust enforcement authorities
or any other Person may assert under the HSR Act with respect to

committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom
of the Division or of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of their respective businesses or assets, in
each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing, _provided, however_ , that nothing in this
Section 5.5 shall require or be construed to require any of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries to take any action, propose or make any divestiture or other
undertaking, or propose or enter into any consent decree, except for those
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (assuming

of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), except as may be required by Law or securities exchange
regulations applicable to any such party, in which case such party shall

relationships with the Division pertaining to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, without the
prior written approval of Seller (which approval will not be unreasonably

contemplated hereby.

supplement or amend the Disclosure Letter with respect to (i) any matter that
existed as of the date of this Agreement and should have been set forth or
described in the Disclosure Letter and (ii) any matter hereafter arising
which, if existing as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required
to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that

and covenants, unless and only to the extent expressly consented to in writing
by Buyer.

  

(b) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of, and furnish Buyer any
information it may reasonably request with respect to, the occurrence, to the

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

cause any of the conditions to Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the purchase
and sale of the Shares not to be fulfilled.

  

(c) Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as soon as reasonably practicable,
a copy of (i) the audited financial statements of the Division as of and for

(as hereinafter defined), and (iii) reconciliations from the segment financial

same basis as the reconciliations provided pursuant to Section 3.7(d)(ii).

  

(d) Seller shall provide, shall cause each of the Division Entities
(other than Minority Interest Division Entities) to provide, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the Minority Interest
Division Entities and the respective employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of each of the foregoing to provide, to Buyer all cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer that is reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable in obtaining the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing. Such
cooperation shall include (i) furnishing Buyer and its financing sources the
information described on _Schedule V_ attached hereto (collectively, the
"Required Information"), which Required Information shall be Compliant, (ii)
upon reasonable advance notice by Buyer, permitting employees of Seller who
will become Transferred Employees to participate in meetings, drafting

shows" and sessions with rating agencies (including assisting in the
preparation of materials therefor and offering documents, business projections
and similar marketing documents required in connection with the Debt

reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c), (d)
and (e) of Exhibit E to the Debt Commitment Letters, (iv) reasonably
cooperating with Buyer in facilitating the pledging of collateral, effective
as of the Closing, including cooperating with Buyer in obtaining appraisals,
financial analyses, surveys, and title insurance and obtaining releases,
terminations, waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals as may be reasonably
required in connection therewith, in each case as reasonably requested by
Buyer, (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the independent
accountants for the Company and the Division Entities ("Accountants") to
deliver written consents for the inclusion of their report(s) on the Audited
Financial Statements, 2006 Audited Financial Statements and any other audited
financial statements included in the Required Information in any materials
used connection with the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing,
including any registration statement filed in connection therewith, and using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accountants to provide a
customary comfort letter (including customary "negative assurances") in
accordance with SAS 72 (subject to any requirements set forth in SAS 72) for
any such offering, (vi) executing any reasonably necessary management
representation letters to the Accountants to issue reports with respect to the
financial statements to be included in any offering documents and in any
updated filings or amendments thereto, and (vi) allow Buyer and its lender\'s

diligence, including without limitation by letting such lender\'s
representatives inspect Seller\'s, the Company\'s and the Division Entities\'
records and premises and to consult with the Company\'s and the Division
Entities\' officers, employees, attorneys and agents with financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the Company and

  



  

36

shall not be required to provide any such assistance which would interfere
unreasonably with the ongoing business or operations of Seller, the Company
and the Division Entities. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with the foregoing cooperation (including the preparation of
documents in connection therewith). Seller agrees to periodically update any
such Required Information to be included in an offering document to be used in
connection with such Debt Financing so that the Required Information is at all
times Compliant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that Seller is not making, and shall not make, any representation or warranty
as to any of the foregoing information or documents, other than such
representations and warranties as are expressly set forth in Section 3.7
hereof. In connection with any of the foregoing, none of Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee,
reimburse the expenses of any party or incur any other liability not
reimbursed by Buyer. Buyer agrees that the execution by the Company or any of
the Division Entities of any documents effecting the financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the
consummation of the Closing.

  

(e) Notwithstanding subsection (d) above, Buyer affirms that it is
not a condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Buyer obtain financing for or related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Affiliates (including the Company and the Division Entities) or otherwise on
behalf of the Company or any of the Division Entities, that are used in the
Business, other than the Permits set forth in Section 5.8 of the Disclosure
Letter, shall be duly and validly transferred, to the extent transferable, to

to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, Seller shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Buyer to the extent reasonably practicable all original
agreements, documents, books, records and files (collectively, "Records"), if
any, in the possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates, relating primarily
to the Division and the Division Entities, and copies of or post-Closing
access to Records (appropriately redacted of information not relating to the
Division) to the extent relating (but not primarily) to the Division and the
Division Entities, in each case to the extent not then in the possession of
the Company and the Division Entities, subject to the following exceptions:

  

(i) Buyer recognizes that certain Records (other than
confidentiality agreements with potential purchasers, all of which shall be
assigned to the Division prior to the Closing) may contain incidental
information

  



  

37

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

relating to the Company and the Division Entities or may relate primarily to
Subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the Company and the Division
Entities, and that Seller may retain such Records and shall provide copies of
the relevant portions thereof to Buyer; and

  

(ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the
sale of the Shares, including all information and correspondence received from
other parties and analyses relating to the Company and the Division Entities.

  

(iii) Until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, prior to any
destruction by Buyer of any Records of the Division delivered to Buyer
hereunder, Buyer shall first give Seller advance written notice of such
intended destruction, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the
Records to be destroyed. Seller shall have twenty (20) Business Days after the
receipt of such notice in which to notify Buyer in the event that it desired
that Buyer return the Records to Seller in lieu of destruction. If such notice
from Seller is provided within such twenty (20) Business Day period, Buyer
shall not destroy such Records and shall promptly forward the Records in
question to Seller, at Seller\'s expense. In the event that such notice from
Seller is not provided in such twenty (20) Business Day period, Buyer may
proceed with the destruction.

  

(b) In order that Seller may properly respond to, conduct, manage or
otherwise participate in any Litigation which may arise from, or relate to,
any of the matters set forth on Section 5.9 of the Disclosure Letter, or any
settlement, arrangement or agreement entered into in connection therewith
(collectively, the "Retained Litigation"), Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate, and to cause its Affiliates, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives to reasonably cooperate, with Seller, its Affiliates,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives in connection with
the Retained Litigation. Following the Closing, neither Buyer, the Company,
nor any Division Entity shall have any rights in connection with the Retained
Litigation and Seller shall have the right to settle the Retained Litigation
on behalf and in the name of the Company and/or any of the Division Entities;
_provided, however_ , that Seller shall not, without the consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
enter into any settlement with respect to any Retained Litigation which
settlement provides for any injunctive or other equitable relief that is
adverse in any material respect to the Business of the Division or any
Division Entity or imposes any liability or obligation on any Division Entity
following the Closing. Without limiting the scope of the foregoing and except
for books and records relating to Taxes, which are addressed by Section
6.1(d)(vi) hereof, following the Closing, Buyer shall permit Seller and its
authorized representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to have reasonable access to, and examine and make copies of, all
books, records and personnel of the Company and the Division Entities for a
proper business purpose which relate to transactions or events occurring prior
to the Closing, including, without limitation, the events or circumstances
giving rise to the Retained Litigation ("Pre-Closing Transactions") or
transactions or events occurring subsequent to the Closing which are related
to or arise out of Pre-Closing Transactions, to the extent such Pre-Closing
Transactions relate to obligations of Seller or as necessary to comply with
applicable financial reporting obligations. Buyer agrees that it shall retain
all such books

  



  

38

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

and records for a period of seven years following the Closing, or for such
longer period following the Closing as may be required by Law.

  

(c) Buyer acknowledges that as a result of entering into this
Agreement, it and its affiliates will gain access to patient and other
information which is subject to rules and regulations regarding
confidentiality. Buyer shall abide by any such rules and regulations relating
to confidentiality of information that it acquires. Buyer shall maintain the
patient records held at each facility or delivered to it at Closing at the
facilities after Closing in accordance with applicable law (including, if
applicable, Section 1861(v)(i)(l) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
Â§(v)(1)(l)), and requirements of relevant insurance carriers, all in a manner
consistent with the maintenance of patient records generated at the facilities
after Closing.

  

(d) Buyer hereby expressly acknowledges that the operations of Seller
and its affiliates are currently under review by the DOJ. Upon reasonable
notice, during normal business hours, and consistent with the otherwise
applicable legal requirements relating to patient rights, Buyer shall afford
to representatives of the DOJ full and complete access to the originals of the
records transferred to Buyer at the Closing, as well as the right to make
copies of the records. In addition, Buyer shall afford the DOJ the right to
remove original records upon reasonable notice and the substitution of copies
for any records to be removed. Upon reasonable notice, during normal business
hours, and consistent with the otherwise applicable legal requirements, Buyer
shall make its officers and employees available to speak with DOJ
representatives at reasonable times and places after the Closing.

_Financing_ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letters, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein or on other terms not materially less beneficial to Buyer,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in such
definitive agreements that are within its control and (iii) consummate the
Debt Financing at Closing. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment
Letters, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing ("Alternative Financing"), including from
alternative sources, on terms that are not materially less beneficial to
Buyer, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice upon becoming aware of any breach by any
party of the Commitment Letters or any termination of the Commitment Letters.
Subject to Buyer\'s compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.10, in
the event that Buyer shall have notified Seller of the termination of the
Commitment Letters and if, following Buyer\'s commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain Alternative Financing, Buyer shall determine in good faith that
Alternative Financing shall not be available to Buyer, Buyer shall provide
Seller with prompt written notice thereof (the "Financing Termination
Notice"). Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to the Debt
Commitment Letters which would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior

  



  

39

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Buyer shall provide notice to Seller promptly upon receiving the
Financing. Subject to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement,
nothing shall prohibit Buyer from entering into agreements relating to the
financing of the transactions contemplated hereby or the operation of Buyer or
the Company (following the Closing Date in the case of the Company), including
adding other equity providers or operating partners, it being understood and
agreed for the avoidance of doubt that (i) Buyer shall be prohibited from
taking any such action that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
no such action shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder nor
relieve the Sponsor of any of its obligations under the Guarantee.

---|---|--- 
 

  

(i) In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller
hereby covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise provided herein, from
and after the Closing and until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, participate in the management, operation or control of, or have
any financial or ownership interest in, or aid or knowingly assist anyone else
in the conduct of, any business or entity that (A) engages in the Business in
any Restricted Territory, or (B) is, to Seller\'s Knowledge, making
preparations for engaging in such Business in any Restricted Territory
(collectively, "Participate in the Business"); provided, however, that Seller
may (x) Participate in the Business in connection with the continued
operation after the Closing of the Remaining Facilities (as hereinafter
defined), subject to the provisions set forth in Section 1.2 of the Disclosure
Letter, (y) acquire a Person that Participates in the Business, among other
activities of such Person, in any Restricted Territory, provided that such
Person\'s net sales from the conduct of the Business in such Restricted
Territory do not exceed 10% of its total net sales for the completed portion
of its then current fiscal year or the full fiscal year immediately prior to
such acquisition, and (z) enter into, at arm\'s length, any bona fide joint
venture (or partnership or similar business arrangement) with any Person who
is not directly Participating in the Business but which is an Affiliate of
another Person Participating in the Business so long as Seller and its
Affiliates do not directly Participate in the Business in any way. In the
event Seller acquires a Person that Participates in the Business in
compliance with clause (a)(i)(y), then, in each such case, Seller shall,
within twelve (12) months after the date that such acquisition is consummated,
sell or otherwise divest itself of the portion of such acquired Person that
Participates in the Business.

  

(ii) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, solicit or direct any other Person
to solicit any Limited Partner nor any officer or other employee, or any
Person who has been a Limited Partner or an officer, or other employee within
the previous

  



  

40

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

six (6) months, of the Company or any Division Entity to: (A) terminate such
Limited Partner\'s or officer\'s or employee\'s affiliation or employment with
the Company or any Division Entity; or (B) seek or accept affiliation or
employment with Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than, in each case, any
solicitation directed at the public in general in publications available to
the public in general or any contact which Seller or its Subsidiaries can
demonstrate was initiated by such Limited Partner, officer or employee or any
contact after such Limited Partner, officer\'s or employee\'s affiliation or
employment with the Company or any Division Entity has been terminated for at
least six (6) months). SellerÂ’s obligations under this Section 5.11(a)(ii)
with respect to new Limited Partners or new Company and Division Entity
employees hired after the Closing shall be subject to the condition that
Buyer shall have notified Seller of the names of such new employees.

  

(iii) From and after the Closing Date, Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries (A) shall, and shall cause its respective controlled Affiliates
to, treat and hold as confidential any information concerning the Business
that is not, prior to the date hereof, already generally available to the
public (including, without limitation, notes, analyses, memoranda or other
documents prepared by or on behalf of the Division or its respective
Affiliates to the extent that such information contains, reflects or is based
upon, in whole or in part, other confidential information that relates to the
Division (the "Confidential Information")), and (B) in the event that he, she
or it is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Person shall notify Buyer promptly of the request or
requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.11(a)(iii). If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such
Person is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Person may disclose the Confidential Information; provided
that such disclosing Person shall disclose only such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed.

  

(iv) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that if Seller or any one
or more of its Subsidiaries breaches any provision of this Section 5.11(a),
Buyer would suffer irreparable harm and any remedy at law would be inadequate
and that Buyer, in addition to seeking monetary damages in connection with any
such breach, shall be entitled to specific performance, and injunctive and
other equitable relief to prevent or restrain a breach of this Section 5.11(a)
or to enforce the provisions hereof.

of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Section 5.11
shall be amended to revise the scope of such provision, to make it enforceable
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, if possible, or to delete
such provision or such part, such revision or deletion to apply only with
respect to the operation of this Section 5.11 in the jurisdiction of such
court.

entitled to participate in (but not control) the negotiations of any
Partnership Claim and _provided_ _further_ that Seller shall not be entitled

 _ **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**_

     

       



  |  

6.1

  |  

_Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) _Actions to Treat the Company and the Division Entities as
Disregarded_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall take
such action, including converting the Division Entities to limited liability
companies or similar forms of organization, and shall make or cause to be made
such elections, as may be required to cause the Company and each of the
Division Entities, other than (i) the Division Entities listed on _Schedule
VI,_ each of which shall be, immediately before the Effective Time, a member
of the "selling consolidated group" (within the meaning of Section
338(h)(10)(B) of the Code) for which Seller files a consolidated Federal
income tax return which includes the Closing Date, and (ii) those
Division Entities as may be mutually agreed between Buyer and Seller prior to
Closing, to be treated as entities each of which is disregarded as separate
from its owner, within the meaning of Treasury Department Regulation
301.7701-2(c)(2) (and any analogous provision of state or local Tax Law)
("Disregarded Entities"), so that, with respect to each such Disregarded
Entity, Seller shall be treated as selling, and Buyer shall be treated as
purchasing, for all Federal and analogous state and local income tax purposes,
the assets (other than stock of another Disregarded Entity) held by such
Disregarded Entity. Deemed sales of assets pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 6.1(a) are referred to herein as "DRE Sales."

  

(b) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within one hundred twenty (120)
days following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be
prepared and delivered, to Seller, an allocation of the Initial Purchase Price
among the assets of the Company and the Division Entities and the non-
competition covenant set forth in Section 5.11 hereof (the "Allocation"). If,
within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of the Allocation, Seller
notifies Buyer that it disagrees with the Allocation and provides Buyer with a
notice setting out in reasonable detail the reasons for its disagreement (the
"Allocation Dispute Notice"), then Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve
their disagreement within the ten (10) Business Days following Buyer\'s
receipt of Seller\'s Allocation Dispute Notice; otherwise, the Allocation
shall become the "Final Allocation." If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve
their disagreement, the disputed items set forth in the Allocation Dispute
Notice shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose expense
shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall determine and report in writing to Seller and Buyer as to its
determination of all disputed matters submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm and the effect of such

  



  

44

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

determinations on the Allocation within ten (10) Business Days after such
submission, and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as
to Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates. In resolving any disputed
item set forth in the Allocation Dispute Notice, the Independent Accounting
Firm, acting in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator: (i) shall
limit its review to matters specifically set forth in Buyer\'s Allocation
Dispute Notice as a disputed item (other than those items thereafter resolved
by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer) and (ii) shall not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any
party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by any other party
in the Allocation prepared by Seller or Buyer\'s Allocation Dispute Notice
delivered pursuant to this Section 6.1(b). Each of Seller and Buyer shall
have the right, within five (5) Business Days of submission of any disputed
item to the Independent Accounting Firm, to meet with representatives of the
Independent Accounting Firm and present its position as to the resolution of
such disputed item. In addition, Seller and Buyer shall each furnish to the
Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed items, as the Independent Accounting Firm
may reasonably request. The Allocation, as adjusted to reflect the
determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be the Final
Allocation. Buyer and Seller agree to (i) be bound by the Final Allocation,
(ii) act in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation for all purposes,
including, without limitation, the preparation of financial statements and
filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of any Tax audit, Tax review or
Tax litigation relating thereto, and (iii) take no position, and cause their
Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the Final Allocation for
any purpose, in each case, except as otherwise required by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in Section 6.1 shall prevent Seller or
Buyer from making timely elections under Sections 754 and 338(h)(10) of the
Code.

(c)

  |  

_Section 338(h)(10) Election_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(i) In the event Seller does not convert either the Company or one
or more of the Division Entities which is treated as a corporation for Federal
income tax purposes into a Disregarded Entity pursuant to Section 6.1(a)
above, then Seller and Buyer (or other appropriate affiliates thereof) shall
jointly make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
comparable provision of applicable state or local income Tax Law) with respect
to the purchase by Buyer of the shares of the Company and the Division
Entities, as the case may be, which are not so converted, each of which shall
be, immediately before the Effective Time, a member of the "selling
consolidated group" (within the meaning of Section 338(h)(10)(B) of the Code)
for which Seller files a consolidated Federal income tax return which includes
the Closing Date, and shall cooperate with each other to take all actions
necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms, returns,
elections schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and
preserve with respect to such entities a timely election, in accordance with
the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (and any
comparable provisions of state or local Tax Law) (the "338(h)(10) Election").
None of Buyer, Seller, the Company, and the Division Entities shall take or
fail to take any action if so acting (or failing to act) would be reasonably
expected to impair the effectiveness of any such Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  



  

45

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

(ii) In connection with the 338(h)(10) Election, Buyer and Seller
shall mutually prepare an Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or successor
form) and all other schedules and documents as may be required ("Form 8023")
and any comparable forms required by provisions of state or local Law. With
the cooperation of Buyer, Seller shall prepare a draft Form 8023 and provide
such draft Form 8023 to Buyer within twenty (20) days of the provision of the
Conclusive Statement, as provided in Section 1.6(a)(v) hereof. If, within
twenty (20) days of the receipt of the draft Form 8023, Buyer notifies Seller
that it disagrees with the draft Form 8023 and provides Seller with a
statement setting out the reasons for its disagreement, then Seller and Buyer
shall attempt to resolve their disagreement within the twenty (20) days
following Buyer\'s notification to Seller of such disagreement; otherwise, the
draft Form 8023 shall become the Final Form 8023. If Seller and Buyer are
unable to resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to the
Accounting Arbiter or such other internationally recognized accounting firm as
Seller and Buyer shall in good faith agree (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"), whose expense shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer, for
resolution within twenty (20) days of such submission. The Form 8023 delivered
by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be the Final Form 8023. The Final
Form 8023 shall be binding on Seller, Buyer, and their respective Affiliates.
Seller and Buyer shall take no position, and cause their respective Affiliates
to take no position, inconsistent with the Final Form 8023. Neither Seller nor
Buyer shall, or shall permit the Company and the Division Entities to, take
any action to modify the Final Form 8023 (including any corrections,
amendments or supplements thereto) after their execution thereof or to modify
or revoke the 338(h)(10) Election following the filing of the Final Form 8023
by Seller without the written consent of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.
Seller shall timely file the Final Form 8023 with the Internal Revenue
Service.

  

(iii) In connection with the 338(h)(10) Election, on or prior to the
six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller a
proposed determination of the "Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" and the "Adjusted
Grossed Up Basis" (each, as defined under applicable Treasury Regulations)
with respect to the Company and the Division Entities as to which a 338(h)(10)
Election is made. Allocations of the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and the
Adjusted Grossed Up Basis shall be made in accordance with Section 338(b) of
the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations and shall be otherwise
consistent with the allocations made pursuant to Section 6.1(b). Within
fifteen (15) days following such provision, Seller shall have the right to
dispute any such proposed determination or proposed allocation; otherwise,
such proposed determination or proposed allocation shall become final. If
Seller so disputes any such determination or allocation and Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve their disagreement within the twenty (20) days following
notification of such dispute, the dispute shall be submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm, whose expense shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller, for resolution within twenty (20) days of such submission. The
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to such dispute shall
be binding upon Buyer and Seller. Seller and Buyer (A) shall be bound by the
determinations and the

  



  

46

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

allocations determined pursuant to this paragraph consistently therewith for
purposes of determining any Taxes, including the preparation and filing of
Internal Revenue Service Form 8883; (B) shall prepare and file all Tax Returns
to be filed with any Tax authority in a manner consistent with such
allocations; and (C) shall take no position inconsistent with such allocations
in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any Tax authority or otherwise. In
the event that any such allocation is disputed by any Tax authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the
other party hereto concerning resolution of such dispute.

  

(iv) Buyer and Seller shall mutually prepare, and Seller shall timely
file, any forms or schedules similar to Form 8023 that are required for
provisions of state or local Law that are comparable to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 in a manner similar to the above procedure. In the
event that the Final Form 8023 (or similar forms or schedules required for
provisions of state or local Law) is disputed by any Tax authority, the party
receiving written notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party
hereto concerning such dispute.

  |  

_Tax Return Filings, Refunds, and Credits_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(i) Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause such preparation
and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns (including
any Consolidated Income Tax Returns) with respect to the Division, the Company
and the Division Entities for Tax periods that end on or before the Closing
Date (the "Seller Returns"), and will pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes
shown to be due on such Seller Returns. Each such Seller Return shall be
complete and correct in all respects and shall be prepared in accordance with
applicable Law. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable
partnership agreement, Seller shall, at Buyer\'s request, cause any Division
Entity treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes for which an
election under Section 754 of the Code (the "Section 754 of the Code") is not
in effect to make such an election.

  

(ii) Buyer shall timely prepare and file (or cause such preparation
and filing) with the appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns with respect
to the Division, the Company, and the Division Entities for all Tax periods
that include, but do not end on, the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period
Returns"). Each such Straddle Period Return shall be complete and correct in
all respects and shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Law. The
preparation and filing of such Straddle Period Returns shall be consistent
with (including, as necessary, attaching copies of any relevant forms of its
U.S. federal income Tax Return for the year including the Closing Date), and
Buyer shall take no position that is inconsistent with, the 338(h)(10)
Election (or, if applicable, the DRE Sales), the forms filed with the Tax
authorities with respect to the 338(h)(10) Election (or, if applicable, the
DRE Sales) in any proceeding before any Tax authority or otherwise. Buyer
shall provide Seller with copies of any Straddle Period Returns

  



  

47

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

at least forty-five (45) Business Days prior to the due date thereof (giving
effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement (the "Straddle
Statement") setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Pre-Closing
Taxes (as hereinafter defined). If Seller agrees with the Straddle Period
Return and Straddle Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the Pre-Closing Taxes shown on the Straddle Statement not later than the
earlier of (i) the date on which such Taxes are due or (ii) two (2) Business
Days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for payment of
Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return. If, within fifteen (15)
days of the receipt of the Straddle Period Return and Straddle Statement,
Seller notifies Buyer that it disputes the manner of preparation of the
Straddle Period Return or the Pre-Closing Taxes shown on the
Straddle Statement, then Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve their
disagreement within the five (5) days following Seller\'s notification to
Buyer of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve their
disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm, whose expense shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller, for resolution
within twenty (20) days of such submission. The decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm with respect to such dispute shall be binding upon Buyer and
Seller, and Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Pre-Closing
Taxes, as decided by the Independent Accounting Firm, not later than two (2)
Business Days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for
payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return. To the extent
permitted by Law and the applicable partnership agreement, Buyer shall be
permitted to make (or cause to be made) a Section 754 Election on any Straddle
Period Return of a Division Entity which is treated as a partnership for
Federal income tax purposes and for which such an election is not in effect.
For purposes of this Section 6.1(d), a Division Entity treated as a
partnership for Federal income tax purposes shall not be treated as having a
Section 754 Election in effect unless Seller can provide to Buyer such
Division EntityÂ’s originally-filed election under such provision. Further, no
Division Entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes that
is acquired as part of the transactions contemplated hereunder is, pursuant to
the terms of its partnership agreement or for any other reason, prohibited or
otherwise limited or precluded from making a Section 754 Election for any
reason, and Seller has the requisite power and authority to make a valid
Section 754 Election with respect to each such Division Entity without
obtaining consent from any other partner of such Division Entity.

  

(iii) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Division Entities) shall not file any amended
Tax Return, carryback claim, or other adjustment request with respect to the
Division, the Company or the Division Entities for any Tax period that
includes or ends on or before the Closing Date unless Seller consents in
writing; provided, however, that with respect to any Straddle Period, such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, provided
Buyer has made arrangements to the reasonable satisfaction of Seller to make
Seller whole for any detriment or cost incurred (or to be incurred) by Seller
as a result of such amended Tax Return, carryback claim or other adjustment
request.

  



  

48

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

(iv) Seller shall not file any amended Tax Return, carryback claim, or
other adjustment request with respect to the Division, the Company, or the
Division Entities if such amendment, claim, or adjustment would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on the tax position of the Buyer or any of
the acquired entities (including, for example, a reduction of the BuyerÂ’s
basis in certain of the acquired entities, a loss of other tax attributes of
the Buyer with respect to any such entity, or an increase in real or personal
property taxes imposed on the Buyer with respect to any such entity) unless
Buyer consents in writing; provided, however, that such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

(v) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the
Division, the Company, or the Division Entities that are payable with respect
to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes "Pre-
Closing Taxes" shall: (A) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon
or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the Tax period ended on the Closing Date, and (B) in the
case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (A)) imposed on a periodic
basis with respect to the business or assets of the Division, the Company,
or the Division Entities or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause
(A) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be
allocated under this Section 6.1(d)(iv) shall be computed by reference to the
level of such items on the Closing Date. The parties hereto shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to
treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Post-Closing Taxes" shall include any Taxes of the Division, the Company, and
the Division Entities that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
except for the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes.

  

(vi) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns with respect to the Division, the Company,

  



  

49

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

and the Division Entities, including maintaining and making available to each
other all records reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes of the
Division, the Company, or the Division Entities and in resolving all disputes
and audits with respect to all Tax periods relating to Taxes of the Division,
the Company, and the Division Entities. Seller shall prepare (or cause such
preparation) within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, usual and
customary Consolidated Income Tax Return reporting packages with respect to
the Company and the Division Entities for the taxable period ending on
December 31, 2006 and for the taxable period beginning January 1, 2007, and
ending as of the Closing Date.

  

(vii) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to the books and records
(including the right to make extracts thereof) of the Division, the Company,
and the Division Entities to the extent that such books and records relate to
Taxes and to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by Seller
in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operation of the
Division (including the Division Entities) prior to the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of
such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer
shall, prior to such disposition, give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at
Seller\'s expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Seller
may select. In addition to the foregoing, the parties agree to cooperate with
each other with respect to the defense of any claims or litigation relating to
Taxes pertaining to the Division, the Company, or the Division Entities,
provided that the party requesting such cooperation shall reimburse the other
party for the other party\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
furnishing such cooperation.

  

(viii) If a Tax Indemnified Party (as hereinafter defined) receives a
refund or credit or other reimbursement with respect to Taxes for which it
would be indemnified under this Agreement, the Tax Indemnified Party shall pay
over such refund or credit or other reimbursement to the Tax Indemnifying
Party (as hereinafter defined).

  

(ix) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company and the Division
Entities not to, make, amend or revoke any Tax election if such action would
adversely affect any Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date or for the portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date or any Tax refund with respect thereto.

  

(x) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Consolidated Income Tax
Return" is any income Tax Return filed with respect to any consolidated,
combined, affiliated or unified group provided for under Section 1501 of the
Code and the Treasury regulations under Section 1502 of the Code, or any
comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Law, other than any income
Tax Return that includes only the Company and the Division Subsidiaries.

them harmless from all liability for (i) all Taxes imposed on the Division,
the Company, or the Division Entities with respect to Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, (ii) Pre-Closing Taxes determined pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(iv) with respect to any Straddle Period, (iii) all Taxes that are
attributable to Seller or any member (other than the Company or the Division
Entities) of an Affiliated Group in which the Company or any Division Entity
was a member at any time prior to the Closing Date that is imposed under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law) by reason of the Company or any of the Division Entities
being included in any such Affiliated Group and (iv) all Taxes with respect to
any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Seller with
regard to Taxes contained in Section 3.13 hereof, which representations shall
survive solely for purposes of such indemnity until sixty (60) days following
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the Taxes in
question. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates against and hold them harmless from all liability for all Taxes
imposed with respect to the portion attributable to periods prior to the
Closing Date of a partner\'s distributive share of the items of the Division
Entities that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes,
such portion to be determined as if such Division Entities had closed their
books (and the partners thereof had taken into account their distributive
shares of the partnership items) on the Closing Date, or based on such
other methodology as may be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer.

  

(iii) Buyer, the Company, and the Division Entities shall indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates against and hold them harmless from all liability
for (i) all Taxes of the Division, the Company, and the Division Entities with
respect to Tax periods beginning after the Closing Date and (ii) Post-Closing
Taxes, as determined pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iv) with respect to any
Straddle Period.

  

(iv) The obligation of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the obligations of Buyer, the Company,
and the Division Entities to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, pursuant to this Section 6.1(e), shall
terminate sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statutes
of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect
to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

(v) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their affiliates
(including the Company and the Division Entities) to treat all payments made
by Seller, on the one hand, and by Buyer, the Company, and the Division
Entities, on the other hand, in respect of their indemnification obligations
under this Section 6.1(e) as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes, and shall not take any contrary position on any Tax Return or before
any Tax authority, unless required to do so by applicable Law. All such
indemnification payments shall be made on an after-tax basis, taking into
account Taxes imposed with respect to the receipt of such indemnification
payments and Tax Benefits attributable to the items being indemnified.

  

(vi) A party seeking indemnification provided for under this
Agreement (a "Tax Indemnified Party") in respect of Taxes arising out of or
involving a claim or demand made by any Person, including a Tax authority,
against such party (a "Tax Third-Party Claim") must notify the party from whom
such indemnification is sought (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") in writing of
the Tax Third-Party Claim as promptly as possible but in no event later than
ten (10) days after receipt by the Tax Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Tax Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result
of such failure (except that the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Tax Indemnified Party
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Tax Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party, as promptly as possible but in no event
later than ten (10) days after the Tax Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Tax Indemnified Party, relating to the Tax Third-Party Claim.

  

If a Tax Third-Party Claim is made against the Tax Indemnified Party, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and
to assume the defense thereof with counsel or other Tax advisors selected by
the Tax Indemnifying Party. If the Tax Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified
Party for legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Tax Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Tax Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Tax Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel or other Tax
advisors, at its own expense separate from the counsel or other Tax advisors
employed by the Tax Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Tax Indemnifying
Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Tax Third-Party Claim, all of the
parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the provision to the Tax Indemnifying
Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax
Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Whether or not the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Tax Third-Party Claim, neither the Tax Indemnifying
Party nor the Tax Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Tax Third-Party Claim

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

without the other\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

(f) _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer, gains,
stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Transition Agreement shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by
Seller, and Seller shall accurately prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes and timely pay all such
Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall have reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any such Tax Return prior to filing, and shall make such changes thereto as
Seller shall reasonably request. Buyer shall pay to Seller one-half of the
Transfer Tax shown to be due on the Tax Return as agreed within ten (10)
Business Days after such Tax Return is given to Buyer. If required by
applicable Law, Buyer will join in the execution of any such Return. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
Restructuring Transactions and the transactions contemplated under Section
6.1(a), to the extent in excess of such Taxes that would have been incurred in
connection with the sale to Buyer of the assets of the Company and the
Division Entities in the absence of such transactions, shall be borne solely
by Seller.

  

(g) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. On or prior to the
Closing Date, any agreement with respect to Taxes to which the Company or any
of the Division Entities is a party shall be terminated (other than
agreements, arrangements or practices solely between or among the Company and
the Division Entities), all obligations thereunder shall be settled, and no
additional payments shall be made under any provisions thereof after the
Closing Date. __

_Division Employees; Employee Contracts and Benefits._ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) _Continuation of Employment_. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall make offers of employment to all employees of Seller and its
Subsidiaries who are employed by Seller in connection with the operation of
any of the Facilities (the "Facility Offerees"), as well as those employees of
Seller and its Subsidiaries primarily involved in providing services to the
Division as listed in Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter (collectively
with the Facility Offerees, the "Division Offerees") on substantially the same
terms, including compensation and benefits, at which they are currently
employed (as set forth in Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter), subject to
the provisions described in Section 6.2(b) as they relate to compensation and
benefits (any such offer of employment, a "Compliant Offer"). Within ten (10)
days following the date hereof, Seller shall provide to Buyer a schedule of
all Facility Offerees, including each such Facility Offeree\'s base salary or
hourly wage rate, as applicable. Effective as of the Closing, all Division
Offerees who receive a Compliant Offer shall cease to be employees of Seller.
Any Division Offerees on approved leave of absence, including by reason of
short-term disability, and who are listed in Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure
Letter as "Employees on Leave," shall become Division Offerees if, and only
if, they are able to return to active employment within 180 days after Closing
except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable Law. Buyer
agrees to hire the Division Offerees who accept such offer of employment.
Division Offerees who accept their employment offers and commence work with
Buyer pursuant to such offers shall be referred to herein as "Transferred
Employees". The

  



  

53

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

foregoing shall not be construed to limit the ability of Buyer, the Company,
any Division Entity or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any employee (including any Transferred Employee) at any time and for any or
no reason. If Buyer terminates, or causes the Company or any Division Entity
to terminate, the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time after the
Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for the costs and consequences of any such
termination and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller against any Damages
arising in connection therewith.

  

(b) _Compensation and Benefits_. Subject to Section 6.2(f) hereof,
upon the Closing, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Buyer shall
offer, or shall cause, as applicable, a Subsidiary of Buyer to offer,
compensation (including base salary, bonus opportunity and wage rate) and
employee benefits (but excluding any equity-based and nonqualified deferred
compensation benefits and benefits provided pursuant to the HealthSouth
Corporation Transitional Severance Plan (Corporate Office Employees) or the
HealthSouth Corporation Transitional Severance Plan (Executive Employees) to
the Transferred Employees) no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to such Transferred Employees on the date hereof under the Benefit
Plans (but excluding any equity-based or nonqualified deferred compensation
benefits or benefits provided pursuant to the HealthSouth Corporation
Transitional Severance Plan (Corporate Office Employees) or the HealthSouth
Corporation Transitional Severance Plan (Executive Employees)). Any employee
benefits provided to such Transferred Employees will be provided under
existing or newly established employee benefit plans which will, in either
case, be employee benefit plans of Buyer, a Subsidiary of Buyer, the Company
or a Division Entity (any such employee benefit plan in which Transferred
Employees participate, the "Applicable Buyer Plan") and which may be modified
or terminated at any time. Transferred Employees shall cease participation,
vesting, benefit and service accruals under all Benefit Plans of Seller
immediately upon the Closing except to the extent otherwise required by the
terms of such Benefit Plans or applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
effective as of the Closing Seller shall take all actions as may be necessary
to fully vest all Transferred Employees in their account balances under
Seller\'s 401(k) plan, and shall permit such Transferred Employees to elect to
roll over their account balances (including any promissory notes evidencing
participant loans) to a 401(k) established by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

  

(c) _Benefit Plan Liabilities_. Except to the extent specifically
provided in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.2(f) hereof, Seller shall assume, retain and
be solely responsible for all obligations and liabilities (i) relating to or
at any time arising under or in connection with any Benefit Plan or any other
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) or other benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement of any kind at any time maintained,
sponsored or contributed or required to be contributed to by Seller, the
Company, any of the Division Entities, or any ERISA Affiliate, or with respect
to which Seller, the Company, any Division Entity, or any ERISA Affiliate has
or could have any liability or obligation, (including, without limitation, any
equity or equity-based awards and any retention bonuses earned or payable
pursuant to Article V of the HealthSouth Corporation Transitional Severance
Plan Â– Executive Employees and any liabilities under the the HealthSouth
Corporation Employee Stock Benefit Plan), and (ii) pertaining to the
employment or service by, or termination from employment or service with,
Seller, the Company, any Division Entity, or any ERISA Affiliate, of any
Person prior to Closing. Seller hereby agrees that any current or former
employee of the Business who (i) as of the Closing Date is receiving or
entitled to receive short-term disability benefits and who

  



  

54

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

subsequently becomes eligible to receive long-term disability benefits, or
(ii) as of the Closing Date is receiving or entitled to receive long-term
disability benefits, shall become eligible or continue to be eligible, as
applicable, to receive long-term disability benefits under Seller\'s long-term
disability plan unless and until such individual is no longer disabled. For
purposes of clarification, Seller shall retain the responsibility for payment
of all covered medical and dental claims with respect to all Division Offerees
(or any covered dependent of any such Division Offeree) under the terms of any
Benefit Plan or other welfare plan of Seller to the extent such claims were
incurred on or prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall not assume nor shall
Buyer, the Company or any Division Subsidiary be responsible for payment of
such claims or expenses.

  

(d) _Certain Other Liabilities_. As of the Closing, all liabilities
and obligations with respect to Transferred Employees relating to (i) accrued
wages and vacation, but only to the extent reflected in Net Working Capital
and (ii) accrued holiday and sick day benefits, shall be assumed by Buyer or
the Company or a Division Subsidiary.

   

       



  |  

(e)

  |  

_Participation and Service Credit_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(i) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer or a Division Entity, as
applicable, shall give Transferred Employees service credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under any Applicable Buyer Plan (other than any equity
based plan) to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
Benefit Plan of Seller immediately prior to the Closing.

  

(ii) Any Applicable Buyer Plan providing health benefits shall in the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs provide that each Transferred
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate in and receive coverage
under the Applicable Buyer Plan as of the Closing if such Transferred Employee
was eligible to participate in the corresponding Benefit Plan of Seller
immediately prior to the Closing. In the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs, Buyer shall waive any restrictions on coverage for pre-existing
conditions or requirements for evidence of insurability under the Applicable
Buyer Plan for Transferred Employees to the extent such restrictions have been
or would have been satisfied under Seller Welfare Plans as of the Closing
Date. In the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, Transferred
Employees shall receive credit under each Applicable Buyer Plan for co-
payments and payments under a deductible limit made by them and for out-of-
pocket maximums and similar limits applicable to them during the plan year of
Seller Welfare Plan in which the Closing Date occurs in accordance with the
corresponding Seller Welfare Plan.

  

(f) _Certain Plans and Agreements_. If, at any time from the
Closing until the date that is one year after the Closing Date, Buyer, the
Company or any Division Entity terminate the employment of any Transferred
Employee, Buyer shall be responsible for any severance due such employees
under the terms and conditions of the applicable severance plan of Seller
disclosed in Section 6.2(f) of the Disclosure Letter (the "Severance Policy").
If, at any time from and after the date that is one year after the Closing
Date, Buyer, the Company or any Division Entity terminate the employment of
any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall be responsible for any severance due
such employees under any applicable severance plan of Buyer.

  



  

55

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

If a Division Offeree does not accept Buyer\'s offer of employment where such
offer violated Section 6.2(b) hereof in that it did not reflect compensation
and employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to (or in excess of) the
compensation and employee benefits provided to such Division Offeree as of the
date hereof, Seller\'s Damages shall include any severance due such Division
Offeree under the Severance Policy. Seller shall retain all liabilities
(including, without limitation, any liability relating to severance under the
Severance Policy, to the HealthSouth Corporation Employee Stock Benefit Plan,
or otherwise) with respect to all Seller employees who are not Transferred
Employees, including without limitation all Division Offerees who do not
accept a Compliant Offer made by Buyer. For purposes of clarification, Buyer
shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to the payment of
any retention bonus pursuant to Article V of the HealthSouth Corporation
Transitional Severance Plan Â– Executive Employees or otherwise.

  

(g) _FUTA; FICA_. Buyer and Seller shall (i) treat Buyer or a
Subsidiary of Buyer as a "successor employer" and the Company and the Division
Entities, as applicable, as a "predecessor," within the meaning of Sections
3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to Transferred Employees
to be employed by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer for purposes of Taxes imposed
under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the United States
Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and (ii) cooperate with each other to
avoid the filing of more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect to each such
Transferred Employee for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  

(h) _WARN Act Requirements_. Provided that on or before the Closing
Date Seller has supplied Buyer with a list of employee layoffs, by location,
implemented by the Division in the 90-day period preceding the Closing Date,
on and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible with respect to
Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries for compliance with the WARN Act
and any other similar applicable Law, including any requirement to provide for
and discharge any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to
Transferred Employees and Governmental Entities that might be imposed as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise.

  

(i) _Employment Agreements_. Buyer shall negotiate in good faith
with each of the Transferred employees who are parties to employment
agreements set forth on Section 6.2(i) of the Disclosure Letter to either (i)
replace such agreements as of the Closing with employment terms satisfactory
to Buyer (and, in connection therewith, terminate such agreements) or (ii)
modify the terms thereof so as to eliminate provisions relating to Seller\'s
equity and assume all post-Closing liabilities and obligations of Seller
arising under such agreements, as so modified.

     

       



  |  

6.3

  |  

_Workers\' Compensation_ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill
the necessary requirements of each state in which the Company or any of the
Division Entities operates with respect to workers\' compensation insurance,
including posting surety bonds or purchasing insurance policies, in each case,

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

. It is expressly agreed that Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise
obtaining any right, title or interest in and to the name "HealthSouth" or any
trade names, trademarks, Internet domain names, identifying logos or service
marks related thereto or employing the words "HealthSouth" or any part or
variation of any of the foregoing or any confusingly similar trade name,
trademark, Internet domain name, logo or service mark (collectively, the
"Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
agree that during the period from the Closing Date until one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Closing Date (the "Wind-down Period"), the Division
Entities shall be entitled to continue to use Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos
to the extent that such Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos exist or are contained
as of the Closing Date on any business cards, schedules, stationery, displays,
web sites, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software
and other similar material used by the Division prior to the Closing Date in
the operation of the Division. The nature and quality of all uses of Seller\'s
Trademarks and Logos made by Buyer, the Company and the Division Entities
shall conform to the quality standards set by Seller and communicated to
Buyer, the Company or the Division Entities, either directly or indirectly
(which standards shall not be more stringent than past practices and, if not
so communicated, shall be comparable to or better than past practices). Buyer,
the Company and the Division Entities shall not use Seller\'s Trademarks and
Logos in any manner which might dilute, tarnish, disparage, or reflect
adversely on Seller or Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos. Buyer agrees that
immediately upon termination of the Wind-down Period, Buyer shall cause the
Division Entities to cease and desist from all further use of Seller\'s
Trademarks and Logos and shall adopt new trade names, trademarks, Internet
domain names, identifying logos and service marks related thereto which are
not confusingly similar to Seller\'s Trademarks and Logos.

     

       



  |  

6.5

  |  

_Software_ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

. Seller shall deliver to Buyer at or prior to the Closing, via means and

software source code and object code, and any computer aided software
engineering tools, application program interfaces, developer toolkits,
utilities and user documentation for the Data Warehouse and Intranet
applications (including without limitation eCodes and eLearning) developed for
or used by the Division, including without limitation, programming statements,
instructions and notes, diagrams, schematics, help files, documentation and
other material that a reasonably skilled programmer would need to operate,
maintain, support and modify the Data Warehouse and Intranet applications
(collectively, "Seller Software"). Seller shall deliver the Hyperion Cubes
associated with the Data Warehouse application used by the Division. Effective
as of the Closing, Seller grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, transferable, worldwide, paid-up, royalty-free right and license
to use, copy, reproduce, display, modify, perform, distribute, sublicense,
prepare derivative works and otherwise exploit the Seller Software (including
the Hyperion Cubes) for its business purposes only.

owners, vendors, service providers and licensors) transfer to Buyer, the
Company or the Division Entities, as applicable, all rights being used by the
Company or the Division Entities under the computer hardware and software

agreements require consent to be transferred or assigned to Buyer), which have
been acquired by Seller on an enterprise basis for use by the Company, the
Division Entities, Seller and/or Seller\'s Affiliates (the "Enterprise
Agreements"), provided that any such transfer or assignment shall only involve
rights being used by the Company or the Division Entities. Seller shall assist
Buyer in effecting such assignments or transfers under the Enterprise
Agreements (including any computer hardware and software licenses, leases and
service agreements listed on Section 3.6(b) of the Disclosure Letter),
provided that any such transfer or assignment shall only involve rights being
used by the Company or the Division Entities, unless Buyer indicates that such
assignment or transfer is not necessary. ** ** Buyer and Seller shall each be
responsible for the payment of 50% of all fees or charges imposed by any
licensor, lessor or service provider under any Enterprise Agreements
(including any computer hardware and software licenses, leases and service
agreements listed on Section 3.6(b) of the Disclosure Letter) as a consequence
of such transfer or assignment (or the actual, reasonable fees or charges paid
by Buyer to purchase its own equivalent agreement to replace any such
Enterprise Agreements for which Seller is unable to obtain consents to assign
or transfer on substantially similar terms). **** Other than as provided in
this Section 6.6, no **** other rights under computer hardware and software
licenses, leases and service agreements used by the Division Entities which
have been acquired by Seller on an enterprise basis on behalf of the Company,
the Division Entities or, as applicable, Seller or other Affiliates of Seller
shall be assigned or transferred to Buyer, the Company or any Division Entity
pursuant to this Agreement, and Buyer, the Company and the Division Entities
shall not be responsible for the payment of any support, lease or license fees

Indemnified Party has given Seller written notice, setting forth therein in
reasonable detail the basis for such Buyer Claim, on or prior to the
termination of such representation or warranty pursuant to Section 11.1

basis for such Seller Claim, on or prior to the termination of such
representation or warranty pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof; _provided,

_Conditions of Indemnification With Respect to Third-Party Claims_ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

. The obligations and liabilities of Seller and Buyer with respect to Buyer
Claims and Seller Claims, respectively, which arise or result from claims for
Damages made by third parties ("Third-Party Claims") shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

  

(i) (A) The indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party
prompt written notice of any such Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure; and (B) the indemnifying
party shall have the right to undertake the defense thereof at its own expense
by counsel chosen by it; provided, that if the indemnifying party assumes such
defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the

  



  

65

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

indemnifying party shall control such defense; _provided further_ that the
indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and
shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the indemnified party
if the Third-Party Claim (I) relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Litigation; or (II) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the indemnified party;

  

(ii) Until the indemnifying party assumes the defense of, a Third-
Party Claim, the indemnified party shall (upon further written notice to the
indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk
of the indemnifying party subject to the right of the indemnifying party to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise or final determination thereof (subject to subclause (B) of clause
(i) above); and

  

(iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article XI to the
contrary, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the
indemnifying party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto, except in the case of any settlement that (A)
includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the indemnified party of a written release from all liability in
respect of such Third-Party Claim or (B) provides solely for monetary relief
and does not otherwise involve or purport to bind or limit the indemnified
party. In addition, if the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense
of the Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability
with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the indemnifying party
will not be subject to any liability for any such admission, settlement,
compromise, discharge or consent to judgment made by an indemnified party
without such prior written consent of the indemnifying party.

     

       



  |  

11.7

  |  

_Other Claims_ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any
indemnifying party under Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof that does not involve a
Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
indemnified party, the indemnified party shall, as promptly as practicable
after discovery of such claim, deliver written notice of such claim to the
indemnifying party. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
which it may have to such indemnified party under Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof,
except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been materially
prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the
indemnified party within twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt of
such notice that the

  



  

66

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under
Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof, such claim specified by the indemnified party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party
under Section 11.2 or 11.4 hereof and the indemnifying party shall pay the
amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of
any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined. If the indemnifying party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by an arbitrator in accordance
with Section 12.10.

     

       



  |  

11.8

  |  

_Sole Remedy._ 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing
occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to
any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, including
Buyer Claims and Seller Claims (whether Third-Party Claims or otherwise), but
excluding any claim relating to either an adjustment to the Initial Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof or fraud, shall be pursuant to the
provisions set forth in Section 6.1(e) and this Article XI; _provided,
however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent an indemnified party
from (i) pursuing remedies as may be available to such party under applicable
Law in the event of an indemnifying party\'s failure to comply with its
indemnification obligations hereunder or (ii) pursuing an injunction or other
equitable relief as may be available to such party under applicable Law.

  

(b) The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the rights of the
indemnified party in respect of any insurance relating to the Damages to the
extent of any indemnification payments made hereunder. The indemnified party
shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the
amount of any Damages for which it is entitled to seek indemnification
hereunder, and the indemnifying party shall not be required to make any
payment to the indemnified party in respect of such Damages to the extent
Buyer has failed to comply with the foregoing obligation; provided that this
subsection (b) shall neither expand nor limit the obligations of an
indemnified party to so mitigate under any applicable Laws. Any liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery
by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

(c) Buyer and Seller agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to
treat) any indemnification payment under this Agreement and any payment under
Schedule 1.2 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Neither Buyer nor Seller
shall (nor shall they permit their Affiliates to) take any position on any Tax
Return, or before any Governmental Authority involved in the administration of
Tax laws, which is inconsistent with such treatment, and Buyer and Seller
shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the extent to which any such indemnification payment is
treated as includible in income for Tax purposes, or otherwise gives rise to
liability for Taxes in respect of the receipt thereof. To the extent any
indemnification payment under this Agreement is treated by any Tax authority
as taxable income to the recipient thereof, such payment shall be increased so
as to ensure that such recipient receives the same payment on an after-Tax
basis that such recipient would have

  



  

67

  



  

     

      

SURGERY CENTERS DIVISION

  



  

received if such payment had not been subject to Tax. Any indemnification
obligation under this Agreement shall be net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually
realized by the indemnified party or its Affiliates, and (ii) any insurance
proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the indemnified party or its Affiliates from any third party with
respect thereto, net of any expenses and increase in applicable
premiums/retro-premiums related to the recovery of such proceeds. The
indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain full
recovery under all insurance policies covering any indemnification obligation
to the same extent as they would if such indemnification obligation were not
subject to indemnification under this Agreement. In the event that an
insurance or other recovery is received by any indemnified party with respect
to any indemnification obligation for which any such Person has been
indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount
of the recovery shall be made promptly to the indemnifying party. As used
herein, "Tax Benefit" shall mean the Tax savings attributable to any
deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund to the indemnified party or its
Affiliates, when incurred or received.

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to damages
claimed by or payable to a third party, the parties acknowledge and agree that
Damages shall not include damages incurred directly or indirectly as a result
of lost profits **** or of any special, consequential or punitive damages.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the limitation
on recovery of special, consequential or punitive damages contained in the
preceding sentence shall not limit a party\'s ability to recover direct or
general damages or change or have any bearing on the interpretation of what
constitutes direct or general damages, it being understood that direct and
general damages shall be given its normal meaning under applicable Law.
