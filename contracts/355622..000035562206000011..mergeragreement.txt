                AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"),
dated July 24, 2006 (the "Agreement Date"), by and among
RYAN'S RESTAURANT GROUP, INC., a South Carolina corporation
(the "Company"), BUFFETS, INC., a Minnesota corporation (the
"Parent"), and BUFFETS SOUTHEAST, INC., a South Carolina
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (the
"Merger Subsidiary").

                         BACKGROUND

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the
Parent, the Merger Subsidiary and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective
companies and stockholders to consummate the merger of the
Merger Subsidiary with and into the Company, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and have
unanimously adopted resolutions adopting, approving and
declaring the advisability of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated herein.

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, shares of the
Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), shall be, except as otherwise
provided herein, converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in the manner set forth herein, and the
Company shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Parent.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and
sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

                          ARTICLE I
                         THE MERGER

          Section 1.1    The Merger

                    .  Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time the Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company (the
"Merger") in accordance with the provisions of the South
Carolina Business Corporation Act of 1988, as amended (the
"SCBA").  Following the Merger, the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and the separate corporate existence of the Merger
Subsidiary shall cease.  As a result of the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Parent.

          Section 1.2    The Closing

                    .  Unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place on a date no later
than the third business day following satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (the "Closing
Date"), at the New York offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison, LLP, unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties.
</page>
<page>
          Section 1.3    Effective Time

                    .  Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing (or at such other time as the parties may
agree) the Company and the Merger Subsidiary shall
(a) execute and file with the South Carolina Secretary of
State appropriate articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") in accordance with Section 33-11-105 of the SCBA
and (b) make all other filings or recordings required by the
SCBA in connection with the Merger.  The Merger shall be
consummated upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with
the South Carolina Secretary of State or such later time as
is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Articles
of Merger.  The time the Merger becomes effective in
accordance with the SCBA is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Effective Time."

          Section 1.4    Effects of the Merger

                    .  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the
SCBA.

          Section 1.5    Organizational Documents

                    .  At the Effective Time, and without
any further action on the part of any Person, the articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company shall be amended
in their entirety to read as set forth on Exhibits A and B,
respectively, and thereby shall become the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their respective terms
and the SCBA.

          Section 1.6    Directors and Officers

                    .  The directors and the officers of the
Merger Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time
shall at the Effective Time become the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office
from the Effective Time in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

          Section 1.7    Conversion of Shares

                    .  As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary or their
respective stockholders:

          (a)  each share of Company Common Stock (a "Share" and
collectively, the "Shares"), other than Shares to be
canceled in accordance with subsection (b) below, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive $16.25 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder
thereof upon surrender of the Certificate formerly
representing such Share in the manner provided in
Section 2.2.  All such Shares, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2;

(b)  each Share owned immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be canceled and
extinguished and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.  For purposes of this Section 1.7(b),
</page>
<page>
Company Common Stock owned beneficially or held of record by
any plan, program or arrangement sponsored or maintained for
the benefit of any current or former employee of the
Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be held by
the Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or any such
Subsidiary, regardless of whether the Company, the Parent,
the Merger Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary has the power,
directly or indirectly, to vote or control the disposition
of such shares.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Subsidiary" means, with respect to any Person, any other
Person fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting
ownership securities of which (or if there are no such
voting interests, fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity
interests of which) are owned, directly or indirectly, by
such first Person; and
(c)  Section 1.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
by employee each Share that is pledged (or held in escrow)
and any outstanding loan or indebtedness (including the
principal balance and interest) whether to the Company or
third party lender in connection with the Company's
Operating Partner and District Partner programs, as of the
Agreement Date, which list shall be updated 2 business days
prior to the Effective Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the case of any employee who has pledged Shares purchased
by such employee in connection with the Company's Operating
Partner or District Partner programs as collateral for any
outstanding loan or indebtedness (whether to the Company or
otherwise), the aggregate Merger Consideration, after
applicable withholding Taxes (as set forth in Section 2.7),
shall be applied by the Surviving Corporation to the
repayment of such loan or indebtedness, and the employee
shall be entitled to receive any remaining Merger
Consideration following such repayment; and
(d)  each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

          Section 1.8   Company Options and Equity-Based Awards.

       (a)  As soon as practicable following the Agreement Date,
the Company shall take such actions as shall be required:
(i) to effectuate the cancellation of any outstanding but
unvested options ("Unvested Options") and vested options
("Vested Options", which term shall include any option that
would vest under its applicable Company Stock Plan (defined
below) as a consequence of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(collectively, the "Company Options") granted pursuant to
the Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc. 1987 Stock Option Plan,
the Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc. 1991 Stock Option Plan,
the Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc. 1998 Stock Option Plan
and the Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc. 2002 Stock Option
Plan (or any other stock option plan, program, agreement or
arrangement of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans")), as of the
Effective Time and to cause all Company Options to no longer
</page>
<page>
represent the right to purchase Company Common Stock or any
other equity security of the Company, the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Person; (ii) to cause,
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Vested
Option to represent as of the Effective Time solely the
right to receive, in accordance with this Section 1.8, a
lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option
Consideration, if any, with respect to such Vested Option,
and each Unvested Option shall be canceled and forfeited
without the receipt of any consideration; and (iv) to cause
the transactions contemplated by this section to be exempt
from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act").

(b)  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to
each holder of a Vested Option, in respect and in
consideration of each Vested Option so cancelled, as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event
not later than five (5) business days after the Effective
Time), an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Vested Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Vested Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable),
without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration").

(c)  As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a
holder of Company Options a letter describing the treatment
of and payment (if such option is a Vested Option) for such
Company Options pursuant to this Section 1.8 and providing
instructions for obtaining payment for such Vested Options.
The Parent shall at all times from and after the Effective
Time cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain sufficient
liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Vested
Options pursuant to this Section 1.8.

(d)  As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall
terminate and all rights under any provision of any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or
grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock
of the Company shall be canceled.  At and after the
Effective Time, no Person shall have any right under the
Company Options, the Company Stock Plans or any other plan,
program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, except
the right to receive the amount payable under this
Section 1.8.

(e)  No additional Company Options or other equity-based
awards or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock shall
be granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or otherwise
after the Agreement Date.

(f)  The Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required or
appropriate such that, upon the Effective Time, each Company
Option and Company Stock Plan is treated in accordance with
this Section 1.8.
</page>
<page>

          Section 1.9    Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

                     As soon as practicable following the
Agreement Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or if
appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company administering the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP")) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that (i) participants
may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase
elections from those in effect as of the Agreement Date,
(ii) no offering period shall commence after the Agreement
Date, (iii) each participant's outstanding right to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall
terminate on the day immediately following the Agreement
Date, provided that all amounts allocated to each
participant's account under the ESPP as of such date shall
thereupon be used to purchase whole shares of Company Common
Stock at the applicable price determined under the ESPP for
then outstanding offering periods using such date as the
final purchase date for each offering period and (iv) the
ESPP shall terminate immediately following the purchases of
Company Common Stock on the day prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs.

          Section 1.10   Adjustments.

                      In the event of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into capital
stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization, exchange, readjustment or other like
change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring
after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time,
all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of
shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all
calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of
shares of any class or series affected thereby, shall be
adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization, exchange, readjustment or other like
change.

                         ARTICLE II
                           PAYMENT

          Section 2.1    Surrender of Certificates.

                      From and after the Effective Time,
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented an outstanding Share (a
"Certificate") shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, upon surrender thereof to the Paying Agent, the
Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly
evidenced by such Certificate were converted into the right
to receive pursuant to the Merger.  No interest shall be
payable on the Merger Consideration to be paid to any holder
of a Certificate irrespective of the time at which such
Certificate is surrendered for exchange.

          Section 2.2    Paying Agent; Certificate Surrender
                           Procedures.


          (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent (with the
approval of the Company, not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed) shall designate, or shall cause to be
designated, a bank or trust company based in the United
States, to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying
Agent").
</page>
<page>

(b)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, an amount in cash sufficient to provide all funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 1.7 (the "Payment Fund").  For purposes of
determining the amount of Merger Consideration to be so
deposited, the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary shall assume
that no holder of Company Common Stock shall perfect any
right to dissent from the Merger and obtain payment for his,
her or its Company Common Stock pursuant to Chapter 13 of
the SCBA.  Pending payment of such funds to the holders of
Certificates, the Payment Fund shall be held and may be
invested by the Paying Agent pursuant to the terms of the
agreement entered into between the Parent and the Paying
Agent.  The Parent shall replenish the Payment Fund to the
extent of any investment losses any monies lost through any
investment made pursuant to this subsection (b).

(c)  As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event not
later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time,
the Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
record holder of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates for the Merger
Consideration.  Upon the surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate together with a duly executed and completed
letter of transmittal and all other documents and other
materials required by the Paying Agent to be delivered in
connection therewith, the holder shall be entitled to
receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates so surrendered have been converted into
the right to receive in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.  If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment
that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid.  Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate shall be deemed from and after the Effective
Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon,
into which the Shares represented by such Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement.

          Section 2.3    Transfer Books.

                      The stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed at the Effective Time, and no
transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter be recorded on any of the stock transfer books.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of
Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of the Company at
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration into which such
Company Common Stock has been converted into the right to
receive in the Merger shall be paid to the transferee in
</page>
<page>

accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 only if the
Certificate is surrendered as provided in Section 2.2 and
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer (including evidence of payment of any
applicable stock transfer taxes).

          Section 2.4    Termination of Payment Fund.

                      Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent upon
demand, and each holder of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time who has not previously surrendered
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Parent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, without any interest
thereon.

          Section 2.5    Lost Certificates.

                      If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
(in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Parent)
of that fact by the Person making such a claim, and, if
required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against or with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the
Merger Consideration in respect of each Share represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

          Section 2.6    No Rights as Stockholder.

                      From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
as a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Laws, and the Parent shall be entitled to treat
each Certificate that has not yet been surrendered for
exchange solely as evidence of the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the Company Common Stock
evidenced by such Certificate has been converted pursuant to
the Merger.

          Section 2.7    Withholding.

                      Each of the Parent, the Merger
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and/or Option Consideration payable to any
former holder of Company Common Stock and Company Options,
or pursuant to Sections 1.8 and 1.9, all amounts required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom by the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or other applicable
state, local or foreign tax Laws.  To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder thereof in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.  All payments to any Governmental
Authority required to be made in connection with the
withholding Taxes as described in this Section 2.7 shall be
paid to the relevant Governmental Authority through the
withholding tax payment systems of the Surviving
Corporation.
</page>
<page>
          Section 2.8    Escheat.

                      Neither the Parent, the Merger
Subsidiary nor the Company shall be liable to any former
holder of Company Common Stock for any portion of the Merger
Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
In the event any Certificate has not been surrendered for
the Merger Consideration prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Closing Date, or prior to such earlier date as of which
such Certificate or the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, then the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable upon the surrender of such
Certificate will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all rights, interests and adverse claims of any
person.

                         ARTICLE III
        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          Except (i) with respect to Sections 3.7 through
3.16 and Section 3.19, as disclosed in any report, schedule,
form, statement or other document filed with, or furnished
to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by
the Company and publicly available at least two (2) business
days prior to the date of this Agreement and, for the
avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to any change of
fact or circumstance subsequent to the date such document
was filed or furnished, or (ii) as set forth in the letter
dated the Agreement Date from the Company to the Parent (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (it being understood that any
information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which
it corresponds in number and each other section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on its face that such information is
relevant to such other section or subsection), the Company
represents and warrants to the Parent and Merger Subsidiary
that:

          Section 3.1    Corporate Existence and Power.


          (a)  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has
all requisite corporate or limited liability company power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently being
conducted, except when the failure to be in good standing or
have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to conduct
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or license necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  The
Company has made available to the Parent or its counsel,
true, correct and complete copies of the charter and bylaws
or other equivalent organizational documents, as applicable
of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as
amended and in effect on the Agreement Date.  Neither the
</page>
<page>
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
of the provisions of its charter or bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents.

(b)  For the purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means a Material Adverse Effect with respect
to the Company and "Material Adverse Effect" means any
event, circumstance, condition, change, development or
effect that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
events, circumstances, conditions, changes, developments or
effects, would have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, assets, liabilities,
operations or results of operations of a Person and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the ability of a Person to
consummate the Merger and to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Person"
means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability
company, a partnership, a joint venture, an association, a
trust, an unincorporated organization or any other entity or
organization, including any Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Company Material Adverse
Effect shall not include any event, circumstance, condition,
change, development or effect (i) relating to financial,
credit or securities markets or economic conditions in
general; (ii) relating to changes in Law or applicable
accounting regulations or principles or interpretations
thereof, to the extent such event, circumstances, condition,
change, development or effect described in this clause (ii)
does not materially, disproportionately impact the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole relative to other
companies operating in the restaurant industry; (iii)
relating to the restaurant industry generally, to the extent
such event, circumstance, condition, change, development or
effect described in this clause (iii) does not materially,
disproportionately impact the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole relative to other companies operating in
such industry; (iv) consisting of any change in the Company
Common Stock price or trading volume, in and of itself, or
any failure, in and of itself, by the Company to meet
revenue or earnings projections (it being understood that
the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to
such change in the Company Common Stock price, trading
volume or failure to meet revenue or earnings projections
may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a Company Material Adverse Effect); (v) relating to the
announcement of this Agreement (including any termination
of, reduction in or similar negative impact on relationships
with any suppliers, distributors or employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, to the extent such change or effect
was due to the identity of Parent or its Affiliates) and the
transactions contemplated hereby and performance of and
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any occurrence of any food
borne illness at any restaurant owned or operated by the
Company that results in death or serious bodily injury which
would reasonably be expected to cause the consolidated
earnings before income taxes of the Company to decline by
more than 10% over a period of at least one year shall be
deemed to have had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            Section 3.2    Capitalization.


          (a)  The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of
One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares of Company Common
Stock.  As of the close of business on July 21, 2006,
42,325,415.38 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and

bound and (ii) issued in compliance with all applicable
Laws, including federal and state securities Laws and all

          Section 3.6 Company Filings; Information in the Proxy
                      Statement.


          (a)  The Company has filed on a timely basis all proxy
statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits thereto), and all amendments
thereto, required to be filed by it with the SEC since
January 1, 2005 (collectively, together with the information
incorporated by reference therein, the "Company SEC
Documents").  Each of the Company SEC Documents, as of its
filing date (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the Agreement Date, then as of the date of such filing)
complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"Securities Act"), the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 ("SOXA") (as the case may be) and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.  No Subsidiary of the Company is required to
file any statements, reports, schedules, forms or other
documents with the SEC.

         (b)  Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the Company SEC Documents (the "Financial
Statements"), (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except in the case of unaudited interim
statements, to the extent they may exclude footnotes or may
be condensed or summary statements as may be permitted by
the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the
Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments.  Except as reflected in the Financial
Statements, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements
(as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Exchange Act).  As of the Agreement Date, the Company
has not had any material dispute with KPMG, LLP regarding
accounting matters or policies during any of its past two
full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year that is
currently outstanding or that has resulted in (x) a passed
adjustment or (y) any restatement of the Financial
Statements.

   (c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, KPMG,
LLP has not resigned nor been dismissed as independent
public accountant of the Company as a result of or in
connection with any disagreement with the Company on a
matter of accounting practices which materially impacts or
would require the restatement of any previously issued
financial statements, covering one or more years or interim
periods for which the Company is required to provide
financial statements, such that they should no longer be
relied on.
</page>
<page>

     (d)  As of the Agreement Date, to the knowledge of the
Company, no investigation by the SEC with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened.

    (e)  As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, the
Company has established and maintains (i) internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act), which is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's
financial reporting and its preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
(ii) disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), which are designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the Company SEC Documents is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  Each Company SEC Document
that was required to be accompanied by the certifications
required of the Company's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of SOXA and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
was accompanied by such certification and, at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, to the
knowledge of the Company's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, such certification was true and
accurate and complied with SOXA and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder as of the date filed.

     (f)  The proxy statement to be provided to the Company's
stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting (such proxy statement and any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, the "Proxy Statement") on the date
mailed to the Company's stockholders and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects
with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

          Section 3.7    No Undisclosed Liabilities.

                      Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued or unaccrued, absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or due or to become
due) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in the
notes thereto, except for (a) liabilities and obligations
accrued or reserved in the Financial Statements as of
December 28, 2005 or otherwise disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents, (b) liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice,
since December 28, 2005, (c) other liabilities and
obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect and (d) liabilities and obligations which

Agreement Date, there has not been a Company Material

</page>

any event, change, circumstance, condition, development or
effect that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse

threatened by or against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) to the Company's knowledge there is no

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding judgment, injunction, order or decree of any
Governmental Authority.  There are no judicial or
administrative actions or proceedings pending, or to the
Company's knowledge, threatened, and to the Company's
knowledge there are no investigations pending or threatened
by or against the Company, that question the validity of
this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by the
Company in connection with this Agreement.

         (b)  Except for instances of noncompliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with each
applicable federal, state, local and foreign law, statute,
rule, regulation, ordinance, code, license, permit, order,
legal doctrine, writ, injunction, judgment, decree,

properties may be subject.  The Company and its Subsidiaries
have all permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations of and
registrations with and under all Laws, and from all
Governmental Authorities, required by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses as
currently conducted, except where the failure to have such

registrations would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

such Person (excluding letters of credit issued for the
benefit of suppliers to support accounts payable to

Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods
ending at and prior to the date of such balance sheet and
there are no material Liens for Taxes upon any property or
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for

performed as an employee in such calendar year commencing in
2005, (B) that has resulted or would result, separately or
in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G, or any
amount that would not be fully deductible as a result of
Code Section 162(m), or (C) pursuant to which it is bound to
compensate any Person for excise or other additional Taxes

knowledge of the Company, any other party to each Real

the passage of time or both, would constitute such a breach
or default, or permit the termination, modification or
acceleration of rent under such Real Property Lease.  Except
as set forth in Section 3.14(b)(4) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no consent by the landlord or other third party
under any of the Real Property Leases is required in

and equipment included in the Real Property (the

all material respects and sufficient for the operation of
the business of the Company, subject to reasonable wear and
tear and subject to replacements and upgrades of fixed
assets consistent with the Company's capital expenditures
budget and in the ordinary course of business.  There are no
facts or conditions affecting any of the Structures which

occupancy of the Structures or any portion thereof in the
operation of the business of the Company.

      (g)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice or has knowledge of any pending, threatened

or other Person relating to any Real Property or the
activities thereon which would be reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.  No damage or
destruction has occurred with respect to any of the Real
Property that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

     (i)  Section 3.14(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of all construction and material alteration
projects currently ongoing with respect to any Real Property
(the "Construction Projects").  The Construction Projects
are proceeding in a workmanlike fashion in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and ordinances, and, to the Company's knowledge,
there are no facts or conditions affecting any of the
Construction Projects which would interfere in any
significant respect with the completion of the Construction
Projects, or the use, occupancy or operation thereof, which
interference would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  No Construction Project or portion
thereof is dependent for its access, operation or utility on
any land, building or other improvement not included in the

Subsidiary's products or services currently or previously
used by the Company or such Subsidiary or (y) opposing or

manner that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
violation of the privacy rights of third parties.  Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has collected,
received or used such information in an unlawful manner or
in violation of the privacy rights of third parties, and to
the Company's knowledge, no Person has gained unauthorized

in any manner that has led or could reasonably be expected

Company will timely give all notices required to be issued
under, and otherwise comply with, WARN and any similar state
or local statues and regulations of any applicable
jurisdiction related to "plant closings", "mass layoffs" (or
similar triggering event) caused by the Company.  To the
extent that, after the Closing, the Parent operates the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the same
manner operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries during
the six-month period prior to the Closing, the Parent will
not incur any liability under WARN or any similar state or
local statute.

Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) the provisions of the Rights
Agreement, including the occurrence of a Share Acquisition
Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or Distribution
Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement), are not and shall
not be triggered by reason of the execution, announcement or
consummation of this Agreement, the Merger any other

necessary action to render any other potentially applicable
anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation or provision

organizational or constitutive document or governing
instruments of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 3.19   Insurance.

                      Section 3.19 of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all material
insurance policies that the Company and each of its
respective Subsidiaries maintain.  Such policies or binders
of insurance cover risks in amounts adequate for the Company

its Subsidiaries operate.  All material insurance policies
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries are in full
force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have
been paid (and no further premiums or payments are due after
the Effective Time with respect to any coverage prior to the
Effective Time), and the Company and its Subsidiaries are
otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the
terms and conditions of such policies.  No limit imposed on
any such insurance policy has been exhausted or
significantly diminished and each provider of the insurance
policies listed in Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure
Letter is solvent as of the Agreement Date.  The Company has
made available to the Parent true and correct copies of all
loss run reports for the past five years which have been

copy of which has been previously delivered to the Parent,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to
any financial advisor, broker, finder or agent with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 3.21   Opinion of Financial Advisor.

                      The Company has received the opinion
of Brookwood, dated the Agreement Date, to the effect that,
as of the date the opinion was delivered, the consideration
to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stockholders") pursuant to this Agreement is fair
to the Company Stockholders, other than the Parent, the
Merger Subsidiary and their respective Subsidiaries, from a
financial point of view.  Upon the Company's receipt of the
written version of such opinion, the Company will promptly
provide the Parent with a copy of such opinion.  The Company
has received the consent of Brookwood to include its final
written opinion in the Proxy Statement subject to the terms
and provisions of the Brookwood Engagement Letter.

          The Parent and the Merger Subsidiary, jointly and
severally, represent and warrant to the Company that:

          Section 4.1    Corporate Existence and Power.

                      Each of the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently being
conducted, except when the failure to be in good standing or
have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Parent or the
Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger (a "Parent
Material Adverse Effect").  Each of the Parent and the
Merger Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to conduct
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or license necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  Since
the date of its incorporation, the Merger Subsidiary has not
engaged in any activities other than in connection with, or
as contemplated by, this Agreement.

          Section 4.2    Authorization of Transaction; Non-
                         Contravention; Approvals.


          (a)  The Parent and the Merger Subsidiary have full
corporate power and authority and have taken all requisite
corporate action to enter into this Agreement and, subject
to the adoption of this Agreement by the Parent as the sole
stockholder of the Merger Subsidiary (which shall occur
promptly after the execution and delivery hereof), to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Parent and
the Merger Subsidiary and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the Company, constitutes a
valid and legally binding agreement of the Parent and the
Merger Subsidiary enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

    (b)  Except for (a) filings and approvals necessary to
comply with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,
(b) filings pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws, (c) the filing of the Articles of Merger
pursuant to the SCBA and (d) any filings required under the
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National Market, neither
</page>

the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parent
and the Merger Subsidiary, nor the consummation by the
Parent and the Merger Subsidiary of the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall (i) violate or conflict with any
provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
Parent or the Merger Subsidiary, (ii) violate any Laws
applicable to the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective properties or assets, or (iii) require any
filing or registration with, notification to, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority; except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for
such violations, breaches or defaults that, or filings,
registrations, notifications, authorizations, consents or
approvals that the failure to obtain, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.3    Financing Capability.

          (a)  The Parent has entered into a sale-leaseback
facility commitment letter with Drawbridge Special Opportunity
Fund, LLC dated July 23, 2006 ("Drawbridge") and the Parent
and the Merger Subsidiary have entered into a debt financing
commitment letter from Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
and UBS Securities LLC (together with Drawbridge, the
"Lenders") dated July 24, 2006 (the "Commitment Letters")
pursuant to which the sale-leaseback facility and debt
financing sources identified therein have committed to
provide to the Parent up to $1.5 billion in the aggregate
(the "Financing"), subject to the terms and conditions
therein and assuming that the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 are satisfied as of the Closing.  The
Parent has delivered correct and complete copies of the
Commitment Letters to the Company.  As of the date hereof,
the Commitment Letters (i) are in full force and effect,
(ii) are binding and enforceable against the Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto
in accordance with their respective terms, except that
(A) such enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer or similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (B) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought,
and (iii) have not been amended or terminated in any manner
adverse to the Company.  As of the date of this Agreement,
the Parent does not believe that the Commitment Letters will
be terminated or amended in any material respect in a manner
adverse to the Company.  As of the date of this Agreement,
the Lenders have not advised Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
any of their respective Affiliates of any facts which cause
them to believe the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters will not be consummated substantially in
accordance with the terms thereof.  All commitment fees and
other fees required to be paid pursuant to the Commitment
Letters on or prior to the date hereof have been paid.

   (b)  To the knowledge of the Parent, as of the date hereof,
there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of
the Financing other than as set forth in the Commitment
Letters.

incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

          Section 4.5    Litigation.

            As of the Agreement Date, there are no claims,
actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Parent, threatened against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority that seek to
restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or that,
if adversely determined, would adversely affect in any
material respect Parent or any of its Subsidiaries' ability
(financial or otherwise) to consummate the Merger.  As of
the Agreement Date, neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any to any outstanding judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Authority
which prohibits or restricts the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

agents' commissions or any similar charges in connection
with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.

   (b)  The Parent shall provide the Company with information

misleading.  For purposes of the foregoing, it is understood
and agreed that information concerning or relating to the
Parent or the Merger Subsidiary will be deemed to have been
supplied by the Parent, and all other information will be
deemed to have been supplied by the Company.  The Company
shall cause all documents filed with the SEC in connection

record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting
upon this Agreement and the Merger, and the Company shall
submit this Agreement at such meeting.  The Company shall
use its reasonable efforts (it being understood that such
reasonable efforts shall not prevent the Company from
withdrawing, modifying or changing its recommendation
</page>
<page>

pursuant to Section 5.8(d)) to solicit from the Company
Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and take all actions reasonably necessary or, in
the reasonable opinion of the Parent, advisable to secure
the Company Stockholders Approval.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company's obligation
pursuant to the preceding two sentences will not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal or any withdrawal of the Company
Recommendation.  Subject to the Company withdrawing,
modifying or changing its recommendation pursuant to
Section 5.8(d), the Company, acting through the Company's
Board of Directors, shall make the Company Recommendation at
the Company Stockholders Meeting.

          Section 5.6    Financing.


         (a) The Parent and the Merger Subsidiary shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letters and to satisfy the conditions
(to the extent such conditions are under the reasonable
control of the Parent) to obtaining the Financing set forth
therein, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements
(the "Financing Agreements") with respect to the Financing
so that the Financing Agreements are in effect as promptly

following satisfaction of the conditions to this Agreement
and (iii) consummate the Financing as soon as practicable
following satisfaction of the conditions to this Agreement.
The Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of the financing process and shall advise the Company
if, at any time after the date hereof, any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3 are
no longer true and correct in any material respect.

         (b) If the Commitment Letters or the Financing
Agreements expire or are terminated, amended, modified or
supplemented for any reason, the Parent shall (i) promptly
notify the Company of such expiration, termination, amendment,
modification or supplement and the reasons therefor and
(ii) in the case of the termination or expiration of either
of the Commitment Letters, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain alternative financing to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; it being
understood, however, that such commercially reasonable
efforts would not require the Parent to obtain financing
that is on terms less favorable, in substance, to the Parent
and the Merger Subsidiary thereunder than those set forth in
the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements, as the
case may be.

         (c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
to reasonably cooperate with the Parent in connection with the
fulfillment of the obligations of the Parent under
Sections 5.6(a) and 5.6(b) of the Agreement and the

as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Parent with all audited financial statements
and interim financial statements of the Company that would

be required to be included in a registration statement of
the Parent filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X,

statements for the Parent in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X, (iii) assist with the preparation of such

arising after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course of business in favor of mechanics, contractors or
repairmen for amounts which are not material to the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
diligently prosecuted, which proceedings have the effect of
preventing the forfeiture or sale of the property subject
thereto, and in each case for which adequate reserves in
accordance with GAAP are being maintained) that are not
Permitted Liens from the Leased Real Property and the Owned
Real Property, (vi) obtain consents, estoppel certificates,
memorandums of leases, and subordination, non-disturbance
and attornments agreements from the lessors of the Leased
Real Property, (vii) permit Phase II environmental
investigations on up to 12 of the Owned Real Properties and
Leased Real Properties and (viii) timely notify all third
parties holding rights of first refusal, rights of first
offers and purchase options against the Owned Real Property

      (d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
to provide the Parent with financial statements and related
information sufficient to permit the Parent to fulfill its
obligations to provide financial disclosure relating to the
Company, on a timely basis in any report under the Exchange
Act.

      (e)  Upon the request of the Parent, the Company shall
(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
independent auditors to deliver to the SEC any auditor's
consent that is required to be included in any filing with
the SEC that includes or incorporates by reference the
financial statements and related information of the Company
and (ii) to the extent the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
conducts or intends to conduct an offering of securities
(and if the registration statement, prospectus or offering
memorandum for such offering includes or incorporates by
reference the financial statements relating to the Company),
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
independent auditors to deliver a letter containing
statements and information of the type ordinarily included
in accountant's "cold comfort letters" with respect to the
financial statements and financial information relating to
the Company contained or incorporated by reference in any
such document relating to any such offering, in the case of
each of (i) and (ii) above, within the time period
reasonably requested by the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.  In addition, in connection with any SEC
filing required to be made by the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any SEC review of such filing), the Company
shall permit the Parent and its authorized representatives
to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the
Company solely for the purpose of preparing any such SEC
filing or responding to SEC questions, comments or requests
on such SEC filing.

          Section 5.7    Additional Reports.

                      The Company will furnish to the
Parent drafts of any Company SEC Documents within a
reasonable time prior to filing with the SEC, and copies of
any Company SEC Documents that it files with the SEC on or
after the date hereof, and the Company represents and
warrants that as of the respective dates thereof, such filed
reports will (i) comply as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) contain financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on
Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange
Act), and (iii) contain financial statements that fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' operations and cash flows
for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements may not contain footnotes and may be
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments.

          Section 5.8    Acquisition Proposals.


          (a)  From the Agreement Date until the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of
the Company Representatives, to immediately cease all
existing discussions, negotiations or other action with any
other Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.  From the Agreement Date until the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and each of the Company Representatives not to,
(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage, directly or indirectly, the making or submission
of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any letter of
intent, agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or agree to approve or endorse
any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding that would require the Company
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) initiate or participate in any way in any discussions
or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any information
to, any Person (other than the Parent or the Merger
Subsidiary) in furtherance of any proposal that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) facilitate or further in any other manner
any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal.  Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any Company Representative, whether or not
such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise, will be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 5.8(a) by the Company.

     (b)  Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in
Section 5.8(a), if at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholders Approval, the Company's Board of
Directors receives a bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal (under circumstances in which there has not been a
violation of Section 5.8(a)) and the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consulting with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
</page>
<page>

Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in
subsection (h) below) and that failure to take the action
permitted under this paragraph would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Laws, the Company may (or permit the Company
Representatives), subject to providing the Parent with the
information required pursuant to subsection (c) below,
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive (including with respect to standstill
provisions) on the other party than the confidentiality
agreement dated March 20, 2006 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal.

    (c)  The Company shall as promptly as practical, and in
any event within forty-eight (48) hours, notify the Parent of
any Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information
or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include a
copy of the applicable Acquisition Proposal or a reasonably
detailed written summary thereof, request or inquiry (or, if
oral, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry), including the identity of the
third party making such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry.  The Company shall keep the Parent advised on a
reasonably current basis of the status and content of any
discussions or negotiations involving any Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly make
available to the Parent any non-public information furnished
to any third party in connection therewith that has not been
previously provided to the Parent.  The Company will notify
the Parent in writing promptly after any determination by
the Board of Directors of the Company that an Acquisition
Proposal is, or would reasonably be likely to result in or
lead to, a Superior Proposal.

     (d)  Neither the Company's Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof will withdraw, modify or change, or
propose publicly to withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
Recommendation, unless prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, (A) the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Laws, and (B) if such
withdrawal, modification or public proposal is taken in
response to a Superior Proposal, then unless the Company
also first gives the Parent three (3) business days written
notice of the material terms and provisions of such Superior
Proposal, during which three (3) business day period the
Company will and will cause the Company Representatives to
negotiate in good faith with the Parent, so that the Parent
may propose an amendment to this Agreement for the purpose
of causing the Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal.  In the case of (i) subclause (A) of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Company may
withdraw, modify or change its recommendation and shall give
the Parent prompt notification thereof; and (ii) subclause
(B) of the immediately preceding sentence, if at the end of
such three (3) business day period, the Company's Board of
Directors continues to believe in good faith, after
</page>
<page>

receiving the advice of its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be
a Superior Proposal, and the Company has concurrently
satisfied its obligations pursuant to Sections 7.3 and 7.4,
then the Company may withdraw, modify or change the Company
Recommendation by written notice to the Parent and terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii).

     (e)  Unless the Company's Board of Directors has previously
withdrawn or modified, or is concurrently withdrawing or
modifying, the Company Recommendation in accordance with
this section, the Company's Board of Directors shall not
recommend any Acquisition Proposal to the Company
Stockholders.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company's
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) and
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure
required by applicable Laws.

     (f)  The Company shall not release nor permit the
release of any Person from, or waive or permit the waiver
of any provision of, and the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which
any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
unless the Company's Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Laws; provided, however, that the Company shall
not release or permit the release from, or waive or permit
the waiver of, any provision of any standstill or similar
agreement the effect of which would be to permit such Person
to effect a transaction without the approval of the
Company's Board of Directors.

     (g)  The term "Acquisition Proposal" means an inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or offer from any Person
other than Parent or any of its Affiliates relating to any
(i) acquisition or sale of (1) 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or
(2) 20% or more (in number or voting power) of the equity
securities of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable), (ii) tender offer or exchange offer, as defined
pursuant to the Exchange Act, that, if consummated, would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more (in
number or voting power) of the equity securities of the
Company (or a Company Subsidiary as applicable), or
(iii) merger, consolidation, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or a merger involving only the Company and
one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

     (h)  The term "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal that is (i) not received in
violation of Section 5.8(a); (ii) for at least a majority of
the outstanding Company Common Stock or all or substantially
all or a majority of the assets of the Company on a
consolidated basis, provided that, a sale-leaseback or similar
transaction shall not be deemed a Superior Proposal;
(iii) fully financed or for which financing, to the extent
required, is reasonably likely to be available; and (iv) on
</page>

<page>

terms that the Company's Board of Directors determines in
good faith (A) would result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the Company Stockholders, from a financial
point of view, than the transaction contemplated hereby, and
(B) is reasonably capable of being completed according to
its terms.

          Section 5.9    Indemnification.

          (a)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
other person who, at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise (the "Indemnified Parties") under the
constitutional documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or any agreement between an Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the
Agreement Date.  The articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified
Parties as those contained in the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company in effect on the Agreement Date,
and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of any of the Indemnified Parties thereunder.

	(b)  The Surviving Corporation shall obtain, at the
Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6)
years from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified
Party on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the
date of this Agreement.  In the event the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies, then, for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts (including with respect to the payment of attorneys'
fees) no less favorable than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of this section, the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to make total annual premium payments with
respect to such policies of insurance to the extent such
premiums exceed two hundred and twenty-five percent (225%)
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
Agreement Date.  If the annual premium costs necessary to
maintain such insurance coverage exceed the foregoing
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain as much
comparable directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance reasonably obtainable for an
annual premium not exceeding the foregoing amount.  The
Company represents that the amount of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the Agreement Date was
the amount set forth on Section 5.9(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.
</page>

<page>
     (c)  The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor the provisions of this Section 5.9 and all
indemnification agreements entered into by the Company and
its Subsidiaries listed in Section 5.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

     (d)  The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall
be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may
have under the SCBA or otherwise.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise,
the provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger, and each Indemnified Party will,
for all purposes, be a third party beneficiary of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 5.9 and,
accordingly, shall be treated as a party to this Agreement
for purposes of the rights and remedies relating to
enforcement of such covenants and agreements and shall be
entitled to enforce any such rights and exercise any such
remedies directly against the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation.

     (e)  If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

          Section 5.10   Public Announcements.

                      The initial press releases issued by
each party announcing the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in a form that is
mutually acceptable to the Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, the Parent and the Company shall consult with
one another before issuing any press releases or otherwise
making any public announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and except as
may be required by applicable Laws or by the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ National Market shall not issue
any such press release or make any such announcement prior
to such consultation, except that (a) the Parent and the
Company shall agree on the content of the first announcement
made to the Company's employees regarding the execution of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
(b) the Company may otherwise communicate with the Company's
employees as it deems appropriate, provided that, in any
formal communications with such employees (other than as
contemplated by Section 1.8), the Company shall not make any
commitments to the employees that might reasonably be
expected to be binding upon the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing.

          Section 5.11   Full Access.

     (a)  Between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford
the Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
</page>

<page>
     (b)  The Parent shall hold, and shall cause its directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives to hold, all
information provided to them pursuant to this Section 5.11
in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and, in the event of the
termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Parent
promptly shall return or destroy all such information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

       Section 5.12   Actions Regarding Anti-takeover Statutes.

                    If (a) the provisions of Chapter 2 of
Title 35 of the SC Code or (b) any other potentially
applicable anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
grant such approvals and take such other actions as may be
required so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

        Section 5.13   Continued Benefit Plans.

                     From the date on which the Effective
Time occurs through December 31, 2006, the employees of the
Company who remain in the employment of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing
Employees") shall receive employee benefits that in the
aggregate are either (i) substantially comparable to the
employee benefits provided under the Company's employee
benefit plans to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) at the Parent's election,
substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of the Parent; provided that
neither the Parent  nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of
their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or
adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance
of, capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation
rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital
stock of any entity or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or
arrangements.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed
as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that
would have the effect of requiring, the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to adopt or continue any specific
plans or to continue the employment of any specific person.

        Section 5.14   Standstill Provisions.

              The restrictions on the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary contained in Section 10 of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby waived by the Company but only to the
extent reasonably necessary to permit the Parent and the
Merger Subsidiary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or to comply with their
obligations or exercise their legal remedies under this
Agreement.

        Section 5.15   Notification of Certain Matters;
                       Supplemental Disclosure.

                Each party shall give the other
reasonably prompt notice upon learning of any event that is
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth
in Article VI not to be satisfied.  The Company shall give
prompt written notice to the Parent of the occurrence of any
event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.  Each of the Company, the Parent and the
Merger Subsidiary agrees to use their respective reasonable
efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (i) the occurrence or
</page>
<page>
failure to occur or the impending or threatened occurrence
or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or
failure to occur would be likely to cause any of its
representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the
Agreement Date to the Effective Time and (ii) any material
failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder.  Each party shall give prompt written notice
to the other of any material development which would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Article VI.
The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.15
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor be deemed
to have amended any of the disclosures set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter, to have qualified the
representations and warranties contained herein or to have
cured any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by
reason of such material development.  No disclosure after
the Agreement Date of the untruth of any representation and
warranty made in this Agreement will operate as a cure of
any breach of the failure to disclose the information, or of
any untrue representation or warranty made herein.

          Section 5.16   Nonqualified Excess Plans.

                      As soon as practicable following the
Agreement Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or if
appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company administering the Company Nonqualified Excess Plan
and the Company Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan
(collectively, the "Nonqualified Excess Plans")) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required (in form and substance satisfactory to Parent) to
provide that  the Nonqualified Excess Plans shall terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided further
that the distribution or payout of account balances with
respect to the Nonqualified Excess Plans shall not be made
until the last day of the month following the six month
anniversary of the termination of such plans.  The Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation  to maintain
sufficient funds to meet the Company's obligation to pay out
such account balances which amounts as of the date of this
Agreement are set forth in Section 5.16 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

          Section 5.17   Title Insurance.

                     The Company shall use reasonable
efforts to assist the Parent in obtaining, at Closing, from
First American Title Insurance Company and Commonwealth Land
Title Company (collectively, the "Title Company") title
insurance policies, in such amounts as the Parent reasonably
determines to be the value of the Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property insured thereunder (the "Title
Policies").  It is anticipated that each of the Title
Policies shall provide extended coverage over the general or
standard exceptions and have those endorsements attached
thereto which are customary and reasonable for a transaction
involving real property of this value and type.  The Company
shall provide the Title Company with such affidavits,
undertaking or other assurances as may reasonably be
requested by the Title Company to issue the Title Policies.
The Parent shall pay all fees, costs and expenses with
respect to the Title Commitments and Title Policies.

          Section 5.18   Surveys.

                     The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to assist the Parent in obtaining, before Closing, a
survey for each Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property, dated no earlier than the date of this Agreement,
</page>
<page>
prepared by a licensed surveyor satisfactory to the Parent,
conforming to 2005 ALTA/ACSM Minimum Detail Requirements for
Urban Land Title Surveys, and in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent (the "Surveys").  The Parent
shall pay all fees, costs and expenses with respect to the
Surveys.

condition set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case

this Agreement has been a principal cause of the failure of
such condition to be satisfied.

                         ARTICLE VII
                         TERMINATION

                      This Agreement may be terminated at

been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before such date;

                   (ii) (A) there are any Laws that prohibit or
make the Merger illegal, or if an order, decree, ruling, judgment

competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree,
ruling, judgment or injunction has become final and non-
appealable, and (B) the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this subsection (b)(ii) has used its
reasonable efforts to resist, resolve or remove such Laws,
order, decree, ruling, judgment or injunction;

                 (iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof), the Company
Stockholders Approval has not been obtained, unless such
failure to obtain the Company Stockholders Approval is the
result of a material breach of this Agreement by the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement; or

                 (iv) any one of the following shall have
occurred; provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this subsection (b)(iv) has used
reasonable efforts to resist, resolve or remove the impediments
to the Closing set forth in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this
subsection (b)(iv):
                         (A)  the waiting period applicable
to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall
not have expired or been terminated by the Outside Date;

                         (B)  any Governmental Authority
files a complaint or otherwise commences a proceeding
seeking a judgment, injunction, order or decree enjoining
the consummation of the Merger or restraining or prohibiting

</page>
<page>
the operation of the business of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time; or

                         (C)  the Parent receives notice
that the United States Federal Trade Commission has
authorized its staff to file a complaint, or that the
Assistant Attorney General or other appropriate official at
the United States Department of Justice has authorized the
staff of the Antitrust Division to seek a preliminary
injunction, as the case may be, enjoining consummation of
the Merger;

          (c)  by the Company:

                    (i)  if (A) the representations and warranties
of the Parent and/or the Merger Subsidiary contained in Article IV
of this Agreement fail to be true and correct in any respect that
causes a failure of the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or (B) the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary
materially breaches or materially fails to perform its
covenants and other agreements contained herein; provided
that, in each of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), such
breach or failure cannot be or has not been cured in all
material respects within thirty (30) days after the
Company's written notice thereof to the Parent or the Merger
Subsidiary; or

                   (ii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholders
Approval, if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company approves and
authorizes the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal, and
(B) immediately following termination of this Agreement the
Company enters into such definitive agreement; provided
that, concurrent with the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this subsection and as a condition precedent
thereof, the Company pays to the Parent the Company
Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement in accordance with
Sections 7.3 and 7.4; or

                 (iii) if (a) either of the Commitment Letters
expires or terminates prior to the Outside Date (or is amended,
such that the total amount of the Financing is not sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby), and Parent
has not secured a replacement Commitment Letter (on terms
that are no less favorable, in substance, to Parent and the
Merger Subsidiary than the expired or terminated Commitment
Letter or Letters) within thirty (30) days after the date of
such expiration, termination or amendment.

          (d)  by the Parent if:

                    (i)  (A) the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in Article III of this Agreement fail
to be true and correct in any respect that causes a failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement or
(B) the Company materially breaches or materially fails to
perform its covenants and other agreements contained herein;
provided that, in each of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
such breach or failure cannot be or has not been cured in
all material respects within thirty (30) days after the
Parent's written notice thereof to the Company;
</page>

<page>
                   (ii) (A) the Company's Board of Directors
(or any committee thereof) withdraws or modifies in a manner
adverse to the Parent or Merger Subsidiary the Company
Recommendation or exempts any Person other than the Parent or
Merger Subsidiary from the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 35 of
the SC Code or the Rights Agreement; (B) the Company's Board
of Directors fails to reconfirm the Company Recommendation
within ten (10) business days after receipt of a request by
the Parent, provided that, any such request may be made only
after notice of any of the following events (as any of the
following events may occur from time to time): (1) the
public announcement of the receipt by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal or any material change thereto; or
(2) a public announcement of any transaction to acquire a
material portion of the Company Common Stock by a Person
other than the Merger Subsidiary, the Parent or any of their
Affiliates; or

         (iii)     the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or approves or
recommends any Acquisition Proposal.

     Section 7.2    Effect of Termination.

                      If any party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 above, all rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without
any liability of any party to any other party, other than
the provisions of this Section 7.2, Sections 7.3, 7.4 and
7.5 and Article VIII of this Agreement which shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, that, subject to such
provisions, any such termination shall not relieve any party
hereto from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement; it being understood that payment of the amounts
described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4  and 7.5 will not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of any such willful
breach.  No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

          Section 7.3    Fees and Expenses.


          (a)  Except as set forth in this Section 7.3 and in
Section 7.4, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

          (b)  If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall (i) pay to the
Parent a fee of $25,000,000 less the amount set forth in
clause (ii) of this Section 7.3(b) (the "Company Termination
Fee") and (ii) reimburse for the Parent's documented out-of-
pocket expenses in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement up to $10,000,000 (the
"Expense Reimbursement") at the time set forth in
Section 7.4.

          (c) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii), then the Company
will pay to the Parent the Company Termination Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement at the time set forth in Section 7.4.
</page>

<page>


	  (d)  If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1(b)(i), Section 7.1(b)(iii), or Section
7.1(d)(i), then if (A) prior to such termination there
exists an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such offer or
proposal has been rejected or has been withdrawn prior to
the time of such termination) and (B) within twelve (12)
months of such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries accepts a written offer for, or otherwise
enters into a definitive agreement to consummate or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall
pay to the Parent the Company Termination Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement at the time set forth in Section 7.4;
provided, however, no payment shall be due to the Parent
pursuant to this Section 7.3(d) if this Agreement is
terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) under
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee set forth
in Section 7.5(a) is payable.  For purposes of the foregoing
clause (d) only, references in the definition of the term
"Acquisition Proposal" to the figure "20%" shall be deemed
to be replaced by the figure "50%."

         (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if the Company pays the Parent both the Company
Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement, the Company
Termination Fee shall be reduced so that the total amount
paid by the Company to the Parent shall be no more than
$25,000,000.


          Section 7.4    Other Company Termination Fee and Expense
                         Reimbursement Matters.


          (a)  The parties shall make all payments required by
Section 7.3 by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the receiving party in writing.

          (b)  The Company Termination Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement shall be paid as follows:

               (i)  if payments are due pursuant to Section
7.3(b), then the Expense Reimbursement and the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid to the Parent by the Company
concurrently with, and as a condition precedent to, such
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(ii);

             (ii) if payments are due pursuant to Section
7.3(c), then the Expense Reimbursement and the Company
Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be paid to the Parent
by the Company within two (2) business days following such
termination of this Agreement by the Parent; and

            (iii)  if payments are to be made pursuant to
Section 7.3(d), then the Expense Reimbursement and the
Company Termination Fee shall be paid to the Parent by the
Company on the earlier of the date of the Company's entry
into a definitive agreement providing for, or consummating,
an Acquisition Proposal.

         (c)  The parties agree that (i) the provisions of
Sections 7.3 and 7.4 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the
amount of, and basis for payment of, the Company Termination
Fee and Expense Reimbursement are reasonable and appropriate


</page>

<page>
in all respects.  Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
in a timely manner a Company Termination Fee and/or Expense
Reimbursement, and in order to obtain such payment, the
Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the
amounts set forth in Section 7.3, the Company shall pay to
the Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in
Section 7.3 at the rate announced by Credit Suisse as its
prime rate in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made hereunder.

          Section 7.5    Parent Termination Fee.

          (a)  If this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii) or if all conditions to Closing set
forth in Article VI are satisfied (other than the condition
in Section 6.3(e) and conditions that, by their nature, are
to be and are capable of being satisfied at Closing), and
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i)
(a "Parent Payment Event"), then Parent shall pay to Company
an amount (the "Parent Termination Fee") equal to
$7,500,000; provided that, no Parent Payment Event shall be
deemed to have occurred and no Parent Termination Fee shall
be payable if the Company shall have breached in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or
covenants, provided that, such breach cannot be or has not
been cured in all material respects within thirty (30) days
after the Parent's written notice thereof to the Company, or
if there shall have been a failure of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.3(c).  Such payment shall be made as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event,
within two (2) business days following the date such payment
becomes due and payable) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

          (b)  The parties agree that (i) the provisions of this
Section 7.5 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the amount of, and
basis for payment of, the Parent Termination Fee are
reasonable and appropriate in all respects.  Accordingly, if
the Parent fails to pay in a timely manner the Parent
Termination Fee, and in order to obtain such payment, the
Company makes a claim that results in a judgment for the
amounts set forth in Section 7.5(a), the Parent shall pay to
the Company its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in
Section 7.5(a) at the rate announced by Credit Suisse as its
prime rate in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made hereunder.

                        ARTICLE VIII
                        MISCELLANEOUS

          Section 8.1    Nonsurvival of Representations.

                      None of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any schedule,
certificate, instrument or other writing delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Merger or the
termination of this Agreement.  This Section 8.1 shall not
limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto which
by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time and this Article VIII shall survive the Effective Time.
</page>

<page>
          Section 8.2    Specific Performance.

                      The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and the non-breaching party could not be
made whole by monetary damages in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms, and it is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement, without posting
a bond or other security, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled hereunder, at law or
in equity.

          Section 8.3    Successors and Assigns.

                      Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations provided by this Agreement
shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties.  Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

          Section 8.4    Amendment.

                     This Agreement may be amended in
accordance with its terms by the execution and delivery of a
written instrument by or on behalf of the Parent, the Merger
Subsidiary and the Company at any time before or after the
Company Stockholders Approval; provided that, after
obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval, no amendment to
this Agreement shall be made without the approval of the
stockholders of the Company if and to the extent such
approval is required under applicable Law or in accordance
with the rules of any relevant stock exchange.

          Section 8.5    Severability.

                      Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Laws, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Laws, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this
Agreement.  The parties hereto agree to replace any such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the
greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

          Section 8.6    Extension of Time; Waiver.

                      Except as set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may extend the time for performance of or waive
compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions of the other parties to this Agreement, and may
waive any breach of the representations or warranties of
such other parties.  No agreement extending or waiving any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless
it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or on
behalf of the party against which it is sought to be
enforced.  Delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

          Section 8.7    Counterparts.

                     This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts (whether by facsimile or otherwise),
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such

</page>

<page>
counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the
same Agreement.

          Section 8.8    Descriptive Headings.

                      The descriptive headings of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement.

          Section 8.9    Notices.

other document to be given hereunder shall be sent in
writing and delivered personally, sent by reputable,

                      Except as provided pursuant to
Section 5.9, the terms and provisions of this Agreement will
not confer third-party beneficiary rights or remedies upon
any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their

of Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and shall

the Surviving Corporation or one of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving

(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties

                     This Agreement, the Confidentiality

representations by or among the parties, written or oral,
that may have related in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

          Section 8.12   Construction.

                      For purposes of this Agreement:

          (a)  References to "applicable" Law or Laws with

only such Law or Laws as to which the Governmental Authority
that enacted or promulgated such Law or Laws has jurisdiction
over such Person, thing or matter as determined under such
Laws.

          (b)  Whenever the context requires, the singular
number shall include the plural, and vice versa, the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the
feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders, and the neuter gender shall include masculine and
feminine genders.

         (c)  The words "include" and "including," and variations
thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

         (d)  Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer
to Sections and Exhibits to this Agreement.

         (e)  The terms "hereof," "hereunder," "herein" and words of

         (f)  As it relates to the Company, "knowledge" means the

of extensive negotiations between the parties, and
consequently, this Agreement shall be interpreted without
reference to any rule or precept of Law to the effect that
any ambiguity in a document be construed against the
drafter.

          Section 8.13   Governing Law.

                      THIS AGREEMENT AND THE COMPANY
DISCLOSURE LETTER WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN

                       Form of Bylaws



                             BYLAWS
                               OF
                     BUFFETS SOUTHEAST, INC.

                        ARTICLE I. OFFICE

     The principal office of the Corporation shall be located in
Eagan, Minnesota, or in such other location as the Board of
Directors may designate. The Corporation may have such other
offices, either within or without South Carolina, as the Board of
Directors may designate or as the business of the Corporation may
require from time to time.

     The registered office of the Corporation required by the
South Carolina Business Corporation Act of 1988 to be maintained
in South Carolina may be, but need not be, identical with the
principal office of the Corporation, and the address of the
registered office may be changed from time to time by the
Corporation in the manner provided by law.

                    ARTICLE II. SHAREHOLDERS

     Section 1.     Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of the
shareholders shall be held within six months of the end of each
fiscal year for the purpose of electing directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may come before the
meeting. The exact time and place of the annual meeting shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

     Section 2.     Substitute Annual Meeting. If the annual
meeting shall not be held within the period designated by these
bylaws, a substitute annual meeting may be called in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5 of this Article. A meeting so
called shall be designated and treated for all purposes as the
annual meeting.

     Section 3.     Special Meetings. Special meetings of the
shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise
prescribed by statute, may be called by the Board of Directors
and shall be called if the holders of at least ten percent of all
the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be
considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date and deliver
to the Corporation's Secretary one or more written demands for
the meeting describing the purpose for which it is to be held.

     Section 4.     Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may
designate any place, either within or without South Carolina, as
the place of meeting for any annual meeting or for any special
meeting. A waiver of notice signed by all shareholders entitled
to vote at a meeting may designate any place, either within or
without South Carolina, as the place for holding such meeting. If
no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the
principal office of the Corporation.

     Section 5.     Notice of Meeting. Notice of the date, time
and place of each annual and special meeting shall be given no
fewer than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the
meeting. Such notice shall be given in writing unless oral notice
is reasonable under the circumstances. Notice may be communicated
in person, by telephone, telegraph, teletype or other form of
wire or wireless communication or by mail or private carrier or
any other lawful means, by or at the direction of the President,
or the Secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting,
to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.
If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder
at such shareholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer
books of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

          In the case of an annual or substitute annual meeting,
the notice of meeting need not specifically state the business to
be transacted thereat. In the case of a special meeting, the
notice of meeting shall state the purpose or purposes for which
the meeting is called.

          When a meeting is adjourned, it is not necessary to
give any notice of the adjourned meeting other than by
announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If
a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed,
however, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons
who are shareholders as of the new record date.

     Section 6.     Fixing of Record Date. For the purpose of
determining shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders'
meeting, to demand a special meeting of shareholders, to vote or
to take any other action, or shareholders entitled to receive a
distribution, or in order to make a determination of shareholders
for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation may fix a future date as the record date, such date
in any case to be not more than 70 days before the meeting or
action date requiring such determination of shareholders. If no
record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive a distribution, the close of
business on the day before the first notice of the meeting is
delivered to shareholders or the date on which the Board of
Directors authorizes such distribution, as the case may be, shall
be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this
section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date
which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than
120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

     Section 7.     Shareholders' Lists. After fixing a record
date for a meeting, the officer or agent having charge of the
stock transfer books shall prepare a list of shareholders
entitled to notice of the meeting, arranged in alphabetical
order, showing the address of, and the number of shares held by,
each such shareholder. The list must be arranged by voting group
and within each voting group by class or series of shares. The
list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder from
the date notice of the meeting to which it pertains is first
given and continuing through the meeting at the Corporation's
principal office or a place identified in the meeting notice in
the city where the meeting is to be held. Any shareholder, or
such shareholder's agent or attorney, shall be entitled on
written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of
Section 33-16-102 of the South Carolina Business Corporation Act
of 1988, or any successor thereto, as amended from time to time,
to copy the list, during regular business hours and at such
shareholder's expense, during the period it is available for
inspection. The list shall also be available at the meeting and
any shareholder, or such shareholder's agent or attorney, shall
be entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or
any adjournment.

          The Corporation's original stock transfer books shall
be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled
to examine such list or to receive notice of or vote at any
meeting of shareholders.

     Section 8.     Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law
or the Corporation's articles of incorporation, a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast on a matter by a voting group,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of
that voting group for action on that matter. If less than a
majority of the outstanding shares are represented at a meeting,
a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting
from time to time. No further notice shall be required for an
adjourned meeting unless a new record date is or must be fixed
for such meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum
shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a
meeting, it shall be considered present for quorum purposes for
the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that
meeting unless a new record date is or must be fixed for the
adjourned meeting. Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting
group may take action on a matter only if a quorum of those
shares exists with respect to that matter. Action may be taken by
one voting group on a matter even though no action is taken by
another voting group entitled to vote on the matter.

     Section 9.     Proxies. A shareholder may vote such
shareholder's shares in person or by proxy. A shareholder may
appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for such shareholder,
including giving waivers and consents, by signing an appointment
form, either in person or by such shareholder's attorney in fact.
An appointment of a proxy shall be effective when received by the
Secretary of the Corporation or other officer or agent authorized
to tabulate votes.

     Section 10.    Voting of Shares. Except as otherwise
provided by law or the Corporation's articles of incorporation,
each outstanding share of the Corporation, regardless of class,
shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a
vote at a meeting of shareholders.

          If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the
election of directors) by a voting group shall be approved if the
votes cast within the voting group favoring such action exceed
the votes cast opposing such action unless a greater number of
affirmative votes is required by law or the articles of
incorporation of the Corporation.

     Section 11.    Informal Action by Shareholders. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders, including the annual meeting, may be taken without
a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled
to vote on the action. The action must be evidenced by one or
more written consents describing the action taken, signed by all
the shareholders entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to
the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the
corporate records. Such written consents may be executed in one
or more counterparts.

     Section 12.    Order of Business. The order of business at
the annual meeting and, so far as practicable at all other
meetings of the shareholders, shall be as follows:

          1.   Call of roll or other method of ascertaining the

number as may be determined from time to time by the Board of
Directors. At each annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect
directors to hold office until the next annual meeting. Except as
otherwise required by law or the Corporation's articles of
incorporation, any directorships not filled by the shareholders
shall be treated as vacancies to be filled by and in the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Each director shall hold
office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until
such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified
or until such director's earlier resignation, removal from
office, death or incapacity. Directors need not be residents of
South Carolina or shareholders of the Corporation.

     Section 3.     Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the
Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this

Carolina, for the holding of additional regular meetings.

     Section 4.     Special Meetings. Special meetings of the
Board of Directors may be held at any time and place upon the

and place and without special notice by unanimous consent of the
directors or such meetings may be held by telephone or
teleconference.

     Section 5.     Notice. Notice of the time, date and place of
any special meeting shall be given at least two days previously
thereto. Such notice shall be given in writing unless oral notice
is reasonable under the circumstances. Notice may be communicated
in person, by telephone, telegraph, teletype or other form of
wire or wireless communication or by mail or private carrier or
any other lawful means. A director's attendance at or
participation in a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, unless the director at the beginning of the meeting
(or promptly upon such director's arrival) objects to holding the
meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not
thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and
place are fixed at the meeting adjourning.

     Section 6.     Quorum. A majority of the number of directors
fixed as provided in Section 2 of this Article III shall

meeting of the Board of Directors, but if less than such majority
is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

     Section 7.     Manner of Acting. The act of the majority of
the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present
shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise
provided in this Section.

          The creation of a committee and the appointment of
members to it must be approved by the greater (i) a majority of
all the directors in office when the action is taken or (ii) the
majority of the number of directors fixed as provided in Section
2 of this Article III.

     Section 8.     Vacancies. Except as otherwise expressly
required by the provisions of the South Carolina Business
Corporation Act of 1988 or successor thereto, as amended from
time to time, or the Corporation's articles of incorporation, any
vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though
less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A director elected
to fill a vacancy shall hold office only until the next
shareholders' meeting at which directors are elected and until a
successor shall be elected and qualified.

     Section 9.     Informal Action by Directors. Action required
or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors
may be taken without a meeting if the action is assented to by
all members of the Board of Directors.

     Section 10.    Order of Business. The regular order of
business at meetings of the Board of Directors shall be as
follows:

          1.   Reading and disposal of any unapproved minutes

          2.   Reports of officers

          3.   Unfinished business

     Section 11.    Committees. The Board of Directors then in
office may create one or more committees of the Board of
Directors and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve
on them. Each committee must have two or more members. To the
extent specified by the Board of Directors, between meetings of
the Board of Directors and subject to such limitations as may be
required by law, the Corporation's articles of incorporation,
these bylaws or imposed by resolution of the Board of Directors,
such committees may exercise all of the authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the Corporation. The creation of,
delegation of authority to or action by a committee shall not
alone constitute compliance by a director with the standards of
conduct prescribed by the South Carolina Business Corporation Act
of 1988.

               Meetings of the committees may be held at any time
on call of the President or of any member of the committee. A
majority of the members shall constitute a quorum for all
meetings. Committees shall keep minutes of their proceedings and
submit them to the next succeeding meeting of the Board of
Directors for approval.

     Section 12.    Compensation. The Board of Directors may
authorize payment to all directors of a uniform fixed sum for
attendance at each meeting or a uniform stated annual or monthly
fee for serving as directors. Directors who are also salaried
officers of the Corporation shall not receive additional
compensation for service as directors. The Board of Directors may
also authorize the payment of, or reimbursement for, all expenses
of each director related to such director's attendance at
meetings.

                      ARTICLE IV. OFFICERS

     Section 1.     Number. The officers of the Corporation shall
be a President, a Treasurer, a Secretary, one or more Vice
Presidents if and when such Vice President(s) shall be deemed
necessary or desirable by the Board of Directors, and such other
officers and assistant officers as the Board of Directors shall
deem necessary or desirable. Any two or more offices may be held

capacity where action of two or more officers is required.

     Section 2.     Appointment of Officers. The officers of the
Corporation shall be appointed annually by the Board of Directors

annual meeting of the shareholders or at such time or times as
the Board of Directors shall determine.

     Section 3.     Removal. Any officer or agent appointed by
the Board of Directors may be removed by the Board of Directors,
with or without cause, whenever in its judgment the best
interests of the Corporation would be served thereby, but such
removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if
any, of the person so removed.

     Section 4.     Vacancies. A vacancy in an office because of
death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may
be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by a person
designated by the Board of Directors.

executive officer of the Corporation and, subject to the control

instruments which the Board of Directors has authorized to be

perform such duties as may be prescribed from time to time by the
President or the Board of Directors. At the request of the
President, or, in the event of the absence or disability of the
President, at the request of the Board of Directors, any Vice
President may act temporarily in the place of the President and
when so acting shall possess all the powers of and perform all
the duties of that officer.

     Section 7.     Secretary. The Secretary shall: (a) keep the

charge and custody of and be responsible for all funds and
securities of the Corporation, receive and give receipts for
moneys due and payable to the Corporation from any source
whatsoever, and deposit all such moneys in the name of the
Corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositaries
as shall be selected in accordance with the provisions of Article
V of these bylaws; and (b) in general perform all of the duties
incident to the office of Treasurer and such other duties as from
time to time may be assigned by the President or the Board of
Directors.

     Section 9.     Compensation. The compensation of the
officers shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of
Directors and no officer shall be prevented from receiving
compensation by reason of the fact that such officer is also a
director of the Corporation.

     Section 10.    Bonds. Any or all officers and agents shall,
respectively, if required by the Board of Directors, give bonds
