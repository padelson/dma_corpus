<PAGE>

outstanding Option granted under the Stock Option Plans whether or not then

Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the former holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive from the Company in consideration for such cancellation an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Company Common Shares
previously subject to such Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Cash Merger
Consideration per share over the exercise price per share, if any, previously
subject to such Option (the "NET VALUE"), subject to withholding or other taxes
required by law to be withheld or (ii) in the event the holder thereof does not
consent to such cancellation, shall after the Effective Time represent solely
the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration per share upon exercise
thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to the individuals listed on
SCHEDULE 3.3 (as such schedule may be amended by the mutual consent of Sub and
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld by Sub or the Company)
from time to time prior to the Effective Time; it being understood that it is
contemplated that additional employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries may
be added to such schedule and the aggregate Net Value set forth opposite the
name of any Person set forth on such schedule may be modified as agreed with
such Person), Options held by each such individual representing an aggregate Net
Value not less than the amount set forth opposite such person's name on SCHEDULE
3.3 shall be retained and shall not be cancelled.

      (b) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed by the parties, the
Stock Option Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement with any current
or former employee, officer, director or consultant providing for the issuance
or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or
any Subsidiary, including the 1996 Non-Employee Director Compensation Program,
shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall exercise its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time, no current
or former employee, officer, director or consultant shall have any Option to
purchase Company Common Shares or any other equity interest in the Company under
any Stock Option Plan or any other Employee Plan maintained by the Company.

      (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Stock Option Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such actions as are necessary, subject, if necessary,
to obtaining consents of the holders of Options to the cancellation thereof in
exchange for the consideration set forth in Section 3.3(a)(i), to carry out the
terms of this SECTION 3.3.

      3.4 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; PAYMENT OF CASH MERGER CONSIDERATION.
          --------------------------------------------------------------

      (a) As of or promptly after the Effective Time, Sub will cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit with a paying agent to be selected by Sub and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Shares, for payment in accordance with this
Article III, the funds necessary to pay the Cash Merger Consideration for each
share and certificates for Surviving Corporation Common Shares.

      (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, (i) each holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which pursuant to SECTION 3.2(B)
represents the right to receive Surviving Corporation Common Shares, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of such


                                       10
<PAGE>

certificate or certificates and acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, shall
be entitled to a certificate or certificates representing the Series A Share
Consideration, into which the number of Series A Shares previously represented
by such certificate or certificates surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) each holder of an outstanding certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Common Shares, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such certificate or
certificates and acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Cash Merger Consideration multiplied by the
number of Company Common Shares formerly represented by such certificate. No
interest will be paid on or accrue on the Cash Merger Consideration or Series A
Share Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall accept such certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose (with the consent of the Company not to be unreasonably withheld) to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange
practices. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the
records of the Company or its transfer agent of certificates formerly
representing Company Common Shares which have been converted, in whole or in
part, pursuant to this Agreement, into the right to receive cash, and if such
certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be canceled
against delivery of such cash. Until surrendered as contemplated by this SECTION
3.4(B), (i) each certificate formerly representing Series A Shares shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a new certificate or certificates representing
Surviving Corporation Common Shares, as contemplated by SECTION 3.2(B), and (ii)
each certificate formerly representing Company Common Shares (other than the
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Cash Merger
Consideration for each Company Common Share.

      (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Surviving
Corporation Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any certificate formerly representing Series A Shares not
surrendered with respect to the Merger. Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of such
certificate or certificates, without interest, at the appropriate payment date,
the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares.

      (d) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of certificates formerly
representing Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such
certificates.

      (e) Any cash or Series A Share Consideration deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this SECTION 3.4 (the "EXCHANGE FUND") which remains
undistributed to the holders of the certificates formerly representing Company
Common Shares or Series A Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation at such time and any former holders of
Company Common Shares or Series A Shares prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving


                                       11
<PAGE>

Corporation and only as general unsecured creditors thereof for payment of their
claim for Cash Merger Consideration or Series A Share Consideration, if any.

      (f) None of Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
office pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If
any certificates representing Company Common Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any federal, state, local, or
municipal, foreign or other government or subdivision, branch, department or
agency thereof and any governmental or quasi-governmental authority of any
nature, including any court or other tribunal), any such cash in respect of such
certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

      (g) In the event any certificate formerly representing Company Common
Shares or Series A Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue or pay, as
the case may be, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the
shares representing the Series A Share Consideration, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares representing the Series A Share Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, or the Cash Merger
Consideration, as applicable.

      3.5 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding SECTION 3.2 hereof, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive the Cash Merger
Consideration. The holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OCL. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section
1701.85 of the OCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with the OCL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) if any such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his entitlement to relief as a
dissenting shareholder as provided in Section 1701.85 of the OCL, (ii) if any
such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for
relief as a dissenting shareholder with respect to such shares or lost his right
to relief as a dissenting shareholder and payment for his shares under Section
1701.85 of the OCL, or (iii) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have filed a complaint demanding a determination of
the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time provided in Section 1701.85
of the OCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to relief as a dissenting
shareholder with respect to such shares and each such share shall be treated as
if it had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive
the Cash Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, from the Surviving
Corporation as provided in SECTION 3.2. The Company shall give Sub prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for relief as a dissenting shareholder,
and Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior


                                       12
<PAGE>

written consent of Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in

          (i)    Pension Plans
                 -------------

                  (A) The Company has hired an enrolled actuary in order to
evaluate the funded status of the Pension Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA
and, to the knowledge of the Company, the funding method used by such actuary in
connection with each Pension Plan which is subject to the minimum funding
requirements of ERISA is acceptable and the actuarial assumptions used by such
actuary in connection with funding each such plan are reasonable. As of the last
day of the last plan year of each Pension Plan and as of the Closing Date, there
are (and were) no material "unfunded benefit liabilities" as defined in Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA (but excluding from the definition of "current value" of
"assets" of such Pension Plan, accrued but unpaid contributions) with respect to
any Pension Plan. Within the six years immediately preceding the Closing Date,
no "accumulated funding deficiency" (for which an excise tax is due or would be
due in the absence of a waiver) as defined in Section 412 of the Code or as
defined in Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA, whichever may apply, has been incurred
with respect to any Pension Plan with respect to any plan year, whether or not
waived. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to pay when due
any "required installment," within the meaning of Section 412(m) of the Code and
Section 302(e) of ERISA, whichever may apply, with respect to any Pension Plan.
Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any lien imposed under
Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA, whichever may apply, with
respect to any Pension Plan.

                  (B) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is required to
provide security to a Pension Plan under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

                  (C) Each Pension Plan and each related trust agreement,
annuity contract or other funding instrument which covers or, with respect to
any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, within the past six years, has
covered current or former employees, directors, officers or consultants of
Company is qualified and tax-exempt under the provisions of Code


                                       19
<PAGE>


Sections 401(a) (or 403(a), as appropriate) and 501(a) and nothing has occurred
during the period from its adoption to date that could materially affect such
qualification.

                  (D) The Company has paid all premiums (and interest charges
and penalties for late payment, if applicable) due the PBGC with respect to each
Pension Plan for each plan year thereof for which such premiums are required.
Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, or is a successor or
parent corporation to an entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in
Section 4069 of ERISA. Within the six years ending on the date of this
Agreement, (1) there has been no "reportable event" (as defined in Section
4043(c) of ERISA and the PBGC regulations under such Section) with respect to
any Pension Plan and neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to
Section 4043(b) of ERISA and no analogous event under applicable foreign law and
(2) except as set forth on SECTION 4.15 of the Disclosure Letter, no filing has
been made by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate with the PBGC, and no proceeding
has been commenced by the PBGC, to terminate any Pension Plan. No condition
exists and no event has occurred that could constitute grounds for the
termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC. Within the six years ending on the
date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any
time, (1) ceased operations at a facility so as to become subject to the
provisions of Section 4062(e) of ERISA or analogous foreign law, (2) withdrawn
as a substantial employer so as to become subject to the provisions of Section
4063 of ERISA or analogous foreign law, or (3) ceased making contributions to
any Pension Plan subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA or analogous foreign law to
which Company or any ERISA Affiliate made contributions during the six years
prior to the Closing Date.

          (ii)    MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS

                  (A) Within the six years ending on the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any time, withdrawn from a
Multiemployer Plan in a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as
defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, respectively, so as to result in a
liability, contingent or otherwise (including without limitation the obligations
pursuant to an agreement entered into in accordance with Section 4204 of ERISA),
of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an entity
that has engaged in, a transaction described in Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

                  (B) All contributions required to be made by Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to each Multiemployer Plan have been made when due.

                  (C) If, as of the Closing Date, Company (and all ERISA
Affiliates) were to withdraw from all Multiemployer Plans to which it (or any of
them) has contributed or been obligated to contribute, it (and they) would incur
no material liabilities to such plans under Title IV of ERISA or analogous
foreign law.

                  (D) As of the date of this Agreement, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, with respect to each Multiemployer Plan: (1) no such
Multiemployer Plan has been terminated or has been in reorganization under ERISA
so as to result, directly or indirectly, in any liability, contingent or
otherwise, of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate under Title IV of


                                       20
<PAGE>

ERISA; (2) no proceeding has been initiated by any person (including the PBGC)
to terminate such Multiemployer Plan; (3) a "mass withdrawal," as defined in
PBGC Reg. Section 2640.7, with respect to such Multiemployer Plan has not
occurred; (4) the Company and the ERISA Affiliates have no reason to believe
that such Multiemployer Plan will be terminated or will be reorganized under
ERISA or that a "mass withdrawal," as defined in PBGC Reg. Section 2640.7, will
occur with respect to such Multiemployer Plan; and (5) the Company and the ERISA
Affiliates do not expect to withdraw in a "complete withdrawal" or "partial
withdrawal" from such Multiemployer Plan.

         (iii)    WELFARE PLANS

                  (A) Except as set forth in SECTION 4.15(B)(III)(A) of the
Disclosure Letter, none of the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any Welfare Plan
has any present or future obligation to make any payment to, or with respect to
any present or former employee of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate pursuant
to, any retiree medical benefit plan, or other retiree Welfare Plan, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no condition exists which would prevent Company from
amending or terminating any such benefit plan or Welfare Plan.

                  (B) Each Welfare Plan which covers current or former
employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Company or an ERISA
Affiliate and which is a "group health plan," as defined in Section 607(1) of
ERISA, has been operated, in all material respects, in compliance with
provisions of Part 6 of Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA and Section 4980B of the
Code at all times.

                  (C) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred
any liability with respect to any Welfare Plan that is a "multiemployer plan,"
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, under the terms of such Welfare Plan, any
collective bargaining agreement or otherwise resulting from any cessation of
contributions, cessation of obligation to make contributions or other form of
withdrawal from such Welfare Plan.

            (iv) COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each Employee Plan presently complies and
has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations which are
applicable to such Employee Plan, including without limitation, ERISA and the
Code, and by its terms can be amended or terminated at any time. Through the
date of this Agreement, the Company has made all contributions and payments
required to be made by it with respect to each Employee Plan, including any
Foreign Plan (as defined below), or adequate accruals therefor have been
provided for and will be reflected in accordance with GAAP on the Financial
Statements provided to the Sub by the Company.

            (v) DEDUCTIBILITY OF PAYMENTS. There is no contract, agreement, plan
or arrangement covering any current or former employee, director, officer or
consultant of the Company (with respect to its relationship with such entities)
that, individually or collectively, provides for the payment by the Company of
any amount that is not deductible under Section 162(m) or 404 of the Code.


                                       21
<PAGE>

            (vi) FOREIGN PLANS. Each Employee Plan that covers any current or
former employee, director, officer or consultant of any Foreign Subsidiary or is
otherwise not subject to ERISA or the Code (each, a "FOREIGN PLAN") has been
maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations
(including without limitation any special provisions relating to the tax status
of contributions to, earnings of or distributions from such Plans where each
such Plan was intended to have such tax status) and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

            (vii) FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS. Neither Company
nor any plan fiduciary of any Welfare Plan or Pension Plan which covers or, with
respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, within the past six
years, has covered current or former employees, directors, officers or
consultants of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, has engaged in any
transaction in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or any "prohibited
transaction," as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, for which no
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(2) or (d) of the
Code, or has otherwise violated the provisions of Part 4 of Title I, Subtitle B
of ERISA. The Company has not knowingly participated in a violation of Part 4 of
Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA by any plan fiduciary of any Welfare Plan or
Pension Plan (or other employee benefit plan subject to ERISA) and has not been
assessed any civil penalty under Section 502(l) of ERISA.

            (viii) LITIGATION. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
action, order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree outstanding or claim, suit,

current or former employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Company.

            (x) INSURANCE CONTRACTS. To the best of the Company's knowledge,

holds as an asset of any Employee Plan any interest in any annuity contract,
guaranteed investment contract or any other investment or insurance contract
issued by an insurance company that is the subject of bankruptcy,
conservatorship or rehabilitation proceedings, the consequence of which would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

            (xi) NO ACCELERATION OR CREATION OF RIGHTS. Except as set forth in
SECTION 4.15 of the Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or other related agreements by the Company nor the consummation

relating to (i) any acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the Assets (other
than purchases and sales or leases of inventory and rental equipment in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) or of over 20% of any
class of Equity Securities of (A) the Company or (B) any of the Company's
Subsidiaries whose Assets constitute more than 20% of the Assets (a "SIGNIFICANT
SUBSIDIARY" (it being understood and agreed that in any event Symons Corporation
shall be deemed to be a Significant Subsidiary)), (ii) any tender offer
(including a self tender offer) or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of Equity
Securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or (iii) any
merger, consolidation, recapitalization, sale of all or substantially all of the
assets, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (each such transaction being referred to herein as an

enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any of
the foregoing or (z) grant any material waiver or release under any standstill,
non-solicitation or similar agreement with respect to any Equity Securities of

shall not prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries (either directly or
indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries) from (i) furnishing
information pursuant to a customary confidentiality letter concerning the
Company and its businesses, properties or Assets to any Person or "group," as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than Sub or any of its
Affiliates (a "THIRD PARTY") who has made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
engaging in


                                       33
<PAGE>

discussions or negotiations with such a Third Party who has made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal and/or (iii) taking any non-appealable, final action
ordered to be taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries by any court of competent
jurisdiction, but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), only to the extent that, in response to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in SECTION
8.1(A)(VI), the Board of Directors of the Company shall have concluded in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel that such action is required to
prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from breaching its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable law; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
foregoing actions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) until after the Company
has given Sub notice thereof as contemplated by SECTION 6.4(D). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, prior to the Shareholder Vote, the Board of Directors of the
Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal and as a result thereof the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with their fiduciary
obligations, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement. The Company shall
immediately cease and order its advisors, agents and other intermediaries to
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing; PROVIDED that
the Company shall be responsible for any such advisor, agent or other
intermediary failing to cease such activities, discussions and negotiations.
Nothing contained in this SECTION 6.4 shall prohibit the Company from taking or
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation
with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be in violation of its
obligations under Applicable Law.

       (b) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall
pay to Sub, within one business day following such Payment Event, a fee of
$6,000,000. "PAYMENT EVENT" means (1) the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to SECTION 8.1(A)(V); (2) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
8.1(A)(VI); or (3) the occurrence of any of the following events if this
Agreement shall have been terminated (i) by Sub pursuant to SECTION 8.1(A)(III)
due to a failure of the condition set forth in SECTION 7.1(A) to be satisfied or
(ii) by the Company pursuant to SECTION 8.1(A)(III) due to a failure of the
condition set forth in SECTION 7.1(A) to be satisfied: (A) prior to the
Shareholder Vote, (x) any Third Party shall have become the beneficial owner of
more than 20% of the outstanding Company Common Shares or (y) any Third Party
shall have made, or proposed, communicated or disclosed in a manner which is or
otherwise becomes public a bona fide intention to make an Acquisition Proposal
(including by making such an Acquisition Proposal) and (B) on or prior to the
date that is within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company
either consummates with a Third Party a transaction the proposal of which would
otherwise qualify as an Acquisition Proposal under SECTION 6.4(A) or enters into
a definitive agreement with a Third Party with respect to a transaction the
proposal of which would otherwise qualify as an Acquisition Proposal under
SECTION 6.4(A) and such transaction is consummated within six months of the date
of such definitive agreement (whether or not such Third Party is the Third Party
referred to in clause (x) above) (it being understood that for purposes of this
clause (B) the phrase "50%" is substituted


                                       34
<PAGE>

for the phrase "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal and that in
determining whether such 50% threshold shall have been satisfied, all Assets and
Equity Securities acquired by the Third Party that consummates the Acquisition
Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement shall be included).

       (c) Upon termination of this Agreement (1) pursuant to SECTION 8.1(A)(V),
8.1(A)(VI) or 8.1(A)(VII), (2) by Sub pursuant to SECTION 8.1(A)(III) due to a
failure of a condition set forth in SECTION 7.1(A) or SECTIONS 7.3(A), (E) or
(F) to be satisfied or (3) by the Company pursuant to SECTION 8.1(A)(III) due to
a failure of the condition set forth in SECTION 7.1(A) to be satisfied, the
Company shall reimburse Sub and its Affiliates not later than two business days
after submission of reasonable documentation thereof for all of their documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and expenses for their counsel and investment banking fees), actually
incurred by any of them or on their behalf in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and the arrangement of, obtaining the
commitment to provide or obtaining the Financing for transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including any reasonable fees payable to the entities
providing for Financing and their respective counsel); PROVIDED that the
aggregate amount payable pursuant to this SECTION 6.4(D) shall not exceed
$1,250,000.

       (d) The Company shall (i) promptly notify Sub (orally and in writing) if
any offer is made, any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated,
any inquiry, proposal or contact is made or any information is requested with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) promptly notify Sub of the material
terms of any proposal which it may receive in respect of any such Acquisition
Proposal, including, without limitation, the identity of the prospective
purchaser or soliciting party, (iii) promptly provide Sub with a copy of any
such offer, if written, or a written summary (in reasonable detail) of such
offer, if not in writing, and (iv) keep Sub informed of the status of such offer
and the offeror's efforts and activities with respect thereto (including,
without limitation, the response of the Board of Directors with respect
thereto).

       6.5 MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. The Company shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable law and its articles of incorporation and code of
regulations, including the timely mailing of the Proxy Statement, to convene the
Special Meeting of its Shareholders as promptly as practicable to consider and
vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend such
adoption and approval, shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation and
shall take all lawful action to solicit such adoption and approval; PROVIDED
that the Board of Directors of the Company may fail to make or withdraw or
modify such recommendation, but only to the extent that the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have concluded in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel that such action is required to prevent the Board of Directors
of the Company from breaching its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable law. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to hold such meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.

       6.6 Proxy Statement.
           ---------------

       (a) Sub and the Company shall cooperate and prepare, and the Company
shall file with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, a proxy statement
with respect to the Special Meeting of the Shareholders in connection with the
Merger (the "PROXY STATEMENT"), respond to comments of the staff of the SEC,
clear the Proxy Statement with the staff of the SEC and promptly thereafter mail
the Proxy Statement to all holders of record of Company Common Shares. The

Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of proxies for
the Special Meeting (including any requirement to amend or supplement the Proxy
Statement) and each party shall furnish to the other such information relating

by the fiduciary duties of the directors under applicable law as contemplated
hereby.

       (b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be made by
the Company to which Sub reasonably objects. Prior to filing any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall give Sub reasonable advance
notice and a copy of the proposed amendment or supplement. The Company shall
advise Sub of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

       6.7 Director and Officer Liability.
           ------------------------------

       (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Sub will cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided under the Company's articles
of incorporation and code of regulations in effect on the date hereof; PROVIDED
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under applicable law. To the maximum extent permitted by the OCL, such
indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive and the Surviving
Corporation shall advance expenses in connection with such indemnification. The
articles of incorporation and the code of regulations of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions substantially similar in terms of the
rights granted to the provisions with respect to indemnification and insurance
set forth in the Company's articles of incorporation, which provisions shall not
be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the rights under those code
of regulations of the Company's employees, agents, directors or officers for
acts or omissions on or prior to the Effective Time, except if such amendment is
required by law. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Sub will
cause the Surviving Corporation to use its reasonable best efforts to provide
officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person currently
covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on
terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof, PROVIDED that in satisfying its obligation
under this SECTION 6.7, Sub shall not be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay premiums in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has been disclosed to
Sub.


                                       36
<PAGE>

(b) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the preceding paragraph, Sub
agrees that the officers and directors of the Company that are defendants in all
litigation commenced by shareholders of the Company with respect to (x) the
performance of their duties as such officers and/or directors under federal or
state law (including litigation under federal and state securities laws) and (y)
the Merger, including, without limitation, any and all such litigation commenced
on or after the date of this Agreement (the "SUBJECT LITIGATION") shall be
entitled to be represented, at the reasonable expense of the Company, in the
Subject Litigation by one counsel (and Ohio counsel if appropriate and one local
counsel in each jurisdiction in which a case is pending) each of which such
counsel shall be selected by a plurality of such director defendants; PROVIDED
that the Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
that a condition to the indemnification payments provided in SECTION 6.8(A)
shall be that such officer/director defendant not have settled any Subject
Litigation without the consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) and, prior to the Closing, Sub; and PROVIDED FURTHER that
neither Sub nor the Company shall have any obligation hereunder to any
officer/director defendant when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
non-appealable, that indemnification of such officer/director defendant in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

       (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume its
obligations set forth in this SECTION 6.7.

       6.8 NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Each of the Company and Sub shall promptly
notify the other of:

       (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

       (b) any notice or other communication from any governmental or regulatory
agency or authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

       (c) any Actions commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to SECTION
4.11 or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Sub which relate to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

       6.9 SUB NOTICE. Sub shall promptly advise the Company of any Material

SCHEDULE 6.1(C) and (ii) take all such actions as may be necessary to exchange
each Company Common Share held by the Persons listed on SCHEDULE A that is set
forth opposite their respective names in SCHEDULE A (as such schedule may be
amended by the mutual consent of Sub and the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld by Sub or the Company) from time to time prior to the
Effective Time; it being understood that it is contemplated that additional
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries may be added to such schedule and
the number of Preferred Shares set forth opposite the name of any Person set
forth on such schedule may be modified as agreed with such Person), for one
Series A Share and complete such exchange, in each case, pursuant to
documentation reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Sub, which
documentation shall provide, in any event, for adoption of this Agreement by
each such Person to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the OCL.

       6.13 BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Sub shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or in the case of
transfer of all the assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its
successors and assigns) to maintain employee benefit plans (except stock option,
restricted stock, stock purchase or other equity based programs, plans and
arrangements) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the Benefit
Arrangements, Pension Plans, Multiemployer Plans and Welfare Plans (except stock
option, restricted stock, stock purchase or other equity based programs, plans
and arrangements) in effect on the date of this Agreement.

       8.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; WAIVERS. This Agreement, together with all exhibits
and schedules hereto (including, without limitation, the Disclosure Letter), and
the other agreements referred to herein, constitute the entire agreement among
the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the parties, other than the Confidentiality Letter. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver
of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver


                                       43
<PAGE>

unless otherwise expressly provided. The Confidentiality Letter shall terminate
at the Effective Time.

       8.5 MULTIPLE COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

       8.6 INVALIDITY. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein,
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by law, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement or any other such instrument.

       8.7 TITLES. The titles, captions or headings of the Articles and Sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be
a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

       8.8 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as provided in SECTION 6.4 hereof, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party
in breach of this Agreement shall, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the
other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
legal fees, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and
protection of its rights under this Agreement. The payment of such expenses is
in addition to any other relief to which such other party may be entitled.

       8.9 CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. All rights and remedies of either party hereto
are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such party may
otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or
remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of
other rights or remedies.

       8.10 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OHIO, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT
MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

       8.11 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at
any time before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of the Company, but after any such shareholder
approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires the further approval
of shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

       8.12 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Neither Sub or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will issue any press release or public
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, without the other party's prior consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by Applicable Law, court
process or the requirements of the NYSE. In addition to the foregoing,


                                       44
<PAGE>

Sub or its Affiliates and the Company will consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
such press release or other public statements with respect to such transactions.
The parties agree that the initial press release or releases to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually
agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof.

       8.13 ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement was
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

       8.14 NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time.

       8.15 Interpretive Provisions.

                                 SCHEDULE 6.1(C)
                           PREFERRED SHARE DESIGNATION

       C. Series a Preferred Shares.
          -------------------------

         1. DESIGNATION. A total of 300,000 of the Corporation's authorized and
unissued Preferred Shares shall be designated as a series known as Series A
Preferred Shares, without par value (the "Series A Preferred Shares").

         The express terms of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be as follows:

         2. VOTING. Except as otherwise provided by law, the holders of Series A
Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights.

         3. DIVIDENDS. The holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available therefor at such
times and in such amounts as the directors may determine in their sole
discretion; provided, however, that no such dividend may be declared or paid on
any Series A Preferred Share unless at the same time a dividend is declared or
paid on all outstanding Common Shares and vice versa, with holders of Series A
Preferred Shares and Common Shares sharing in any such dividends as if they
constituted a single class of stock. Each Series A Preferred Share shall entitle
the holder thereof to receive dividends equal to the dividends payable with
respect to one Common Share. The right to dividends on the Series A Preferred
Shares shall not be cumulative, and no right shall accrue to holders of Series A
Preferred Shares by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not
declared in any prior period.

         4. LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, whether voluntary or involuntary (a
"Liquidation Event"), each holder of an outstanding Series A Preferred Share
shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to shareholders, whether such assets are capital, surplus or
earnings, and before any amount shall be paid or distributed to the holders of
Common Shares or of any other shares ranking on liquidation junior to the Series
A Preferred Shares, an amount in cash equal to any declared but unpaid dividends
to which such holder of outstanding Series A Preferred Shares is then entitled
pursuant to Section 3 (the "Liquidation Preference Amount"); provided, however,
that if, upon any Liquidation Event, the amounts payable with respect to the
Liquidation Preference Amount are not paid in full, the holders of the Series A
Preferred Shares shall share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion
to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled.

         5. NO REISSUANCE OF SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. No Series A Preferred
Shares acquired by the Corporation for or by any reason shall be reissued, and
all such shares shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the Preferred
Shares which the Corporation shall be authorized to issue.

         6. CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS. The various provisions set forth
herein for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be
deemed contract rights enforceable by them, including without limitation, one or
more actions for specific performance.


<PAGE>


         7. NO PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS. The holders of Series A Preferred Shares
shall not have any preemptive rights.

         8. CONVERSION. Upon the filing of the certificate of merger, or such
later time as specified therein, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of
Merger between Dayton Superior Corporation and Stone Acquisition Corp., dated as
of January 19, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"), each Series A Preferred Share
shall by virtue of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the
"Merger") and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive one common
share, without par value, of the Company (as in existence immediately following
the Merger) upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing the Series A
Preferred Share.

                                 SCHEDULE 7.3(F)
                                  INDEBTEDNESS

Total indebtedness for borrowed money (long and short term) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall not exceed:

(1)......$149.5 million, less

(2)      the aggregate amount of all prepayment penalties and fees associated
         with the repayment of the Company's existing credit facilities, less

(3)      an amount equal to $21,250,000 minus the aggregate principal amount of
         Debentures outstanding and held by Persons other than the Company and
         its Affiliates as of the Effective Time, less

(4)      the aggregate amount to which the holders of the Debentures would be
         entitled to receive following the Effective Time upon conversion
         thereof (assuming for the purposes of this clause that the aggregate
         principal amount of Debentures outstanding immediately following the
         Effective Time is $21,250,000 and that all such Debentures are
         converted immediately following the Effective Time) minus $21,250,000;
         plus

(5)      to the extent that in connection with the EFCO V. SYMONS ET. AL matter,
         Symons Corporation is required to pay damages in excess of $1.0
         million, an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of damages
         Symons Corporation is required to pay minus $1.0 million and (b) $14.0
         million; PROVIDED that if the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
         complied in all respects with Section 6.3(f) of the Agreement, this
         clause (3) shall be of no force or effect and the amount for purposes
         of Section 7.3(g) of the Agreement and this Schedule 7.3(g) shall be
         equal to the amount determined pursuant to clauses (1), (2), (3) and
         (4) of this Schedule 7.3(g).
