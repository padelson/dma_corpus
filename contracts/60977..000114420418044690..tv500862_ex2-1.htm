Party of notice of such Third Party Action, and such written notice shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known

costs of defense thereof, (C) the Indemnifying Party promptly pays all costs related to such Third Party Action incurred by the
Indemnifying Party as they are incurred and become due and payable, and (D) an adverse resolution of the Third Party Action would
not have a material adverse effect on the goodwill or reputation of the Indemnifying Party or the business or operations of the
Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Seller may not assume control of the defense of any Third Party Action involving any Governmental
Entity or criminal liability or in which equitable relief (other than incidental equitable relief) is sought against the Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to, so assume control

in (but not control) such defense at its own expense (which, if the Non-controlling Party is the Indemnified Party, shall not constitute
Damages unless such expense is incurred at the request of the Indemnifying Party). The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling
Party reasonably advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith reasonable
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling
Party with such non-confidential information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which have been served on such party and any written claim or demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third
Party Action. The Indemnifying Party shall, subject (if the Indemnifying Party is the Seller) to the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s
satisfaction of the Subrogation Conditions, be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party, except with respect

Party with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Indemnified Party
controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this <U>Section 8.3(a)</U> or (ii) the Indemnifying Party
assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such Third Party Action that cannot be adequately
protected, asserted or otherwise raised by counsel to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to <U>Section 8.3(c)</U>, neither the Indemnifying
Party nor the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment in, any Third Party Action without
the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; <U>provided</U>,
that the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such settlement or entry of any such judgment, if such
settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liabilities that are the
subject matter of such Third Party Action and does not provide for, and is not conditioned on, any (x) payment by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (y) non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (other than customary
confidentiality provisions), or (z) admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, <U>Section 9.8</U> (rather than this <U>Section 8.3(a)</U>) shall govern any Third

such year (or portion of such year beginning after the Closing Date), calculated without taking into account the Transaction Tax
