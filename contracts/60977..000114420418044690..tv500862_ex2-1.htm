transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) any of the transactions which the
Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective
business or assets. The Closing Adjustment Statement, as proposed by the
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 1.3(b)_ , shall be deemed for purposes of this
_Section 1.3_  to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Statement_ ," the
Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of
this _Section 1.3_ to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Items_ " and each
shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement, unless the
Seller timely delivers to the Buyer an Objection Notice in accordance with 
_Section 1.3(c)_.

  



    

 | \- 4 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Following the Closing until the final determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment, the Buyer shall upon reasonable written request
provide the Seller and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or
interfere with the business or operations of the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, to (i) the copies of the relevant accounting books and records
and (ii) the personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work paper
access letters if requested) auditors of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
were involved in the preparation of the Closing Adjustment Statement, in each
case of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ for purposes of verifying the
amounts set forth therein and the accuracy thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Buyer shall not have any
obligation to provide the Seller or any of its Representatives access to any
books or records or other information (1) that is subject to the attorney-
client, work-product or other similar privilege or protection, (2) that was
prepared in anticipation of any dispute regarding the Closing Adjustment
Statement or (3) to the extent the disclosure thereof would violate any
contract or applicable Law and (B) the Buyer shall not have any obligation to
provide (and the Seller shall not provide) any books, records or other
information to any Representative of the Seller under this sentence unless
such Representative is obligated to keep such information confidential and is
instructed to use such information solely for the purposes permitted above.
Any books, records or other information provided by the Buyer to the Seller
or its Representatives pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall constitute
Proprietary Information of the Buyer and be subject to _Section 10.1_. In the
event that the Seller disputes the Closing Adjustment Statement (or any item
therein) or the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items (or any of them), the
Seller shall notify the Buyer in writing (the " _Objection Notice_ ") of the
amount, nature and reasonable basis of such dispute, within forty-five (45)
calendar days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement pursuant to
_Section 1.3(b)_. Any such Objection Notice shall specify those items or
amounts as to which the Seller disagrees, and the Seller shall be deemed to
have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Adjustment Statement and the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items, in each
case, for which no objection or dispute has been provided, delivered pursuant
to _Section 1.3(b)_. In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the Seller
shall first negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items,
which amount shall not be more than the greatest amount for any such item or
less than the lowest amount for any such item, in each case calculated by the
Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_ or by the Seller pursuant to this _Section
1.3(c)_. If the Buyer and the Seller reach a final resolution on the Closing
Adjustment Statement within 30 days after the Buyer's receipt of the
Objection Notice (or within any additional period as mutually agreed to
between the Buyer and the Seller), then the Closing Adjustment Statement
agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller shall be deemed for purposes of this
_Section 1.3_  to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Statement_ ," the
Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of
this _Section 1.3_ to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Items_ " and each
shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

  



  

(d) If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve all of the
disputed items within 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Objection Notice, then any remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to
an independent nationally recognized accounting firm selected in writing by
the Seller and the Buyer or, if the Seller and the Buyer fail or refuse to
select a firm within 10 calendar days after written request therefor by the
Seller or the Buyer, such an independent nationally recognized accounting firm
shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the New York, New York
office of the American Arbitration Association (the " _Neutral Accountant_
"). All determinations and calculations pursuant to this _Section 1.3(d)_
shall consider only those Closing Adjustment Items that are set forth in the
Objection Notice and remain in dispute, shall be made in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and other defined terms herein, shall be a value that
is not more than the greatest amount for any such item or less than the lowest
amount for any such item, in each case calculated by the Buyer pursuant to
_Section 1.3(b)_ or by the Seller pursuant to _Section 1.3(c)_ , shall be in
writing and shall be delivered to the Buyer and the Seller as promptly as
practicable. Absent fraud or manifest error, the Closing Adjustment Statement
as finally determined by the Neutral Accountant shall be deemed for purposes
of this _Section 1.3_ to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Statement_ ," the
Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of
this _Section 1.3_ to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Items_ " and each
shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement. In determining
the Closing Adjustment Statement and the Closing Adjustment Items, the
Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator. The Neutral
Accountant shall resolve each such unresolved disputed item based solely on
the supporting material provided by the Buyer and the Seller and not pursuant
to any independent review. The Seller and the Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts to cooperate fully with the Neutral Accountant and respond on a
timely basis to all requests made by the Neutral Accountant, all with the
intent to resolve in good faith all such unresolved disputed items as
promptly as reasonably practicable. A judgment on the determination made by
the Neutral Accountant pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ may be entered in and
enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereover.

  



    

 | \- 5 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in connection
with the resolution of disputes pursuant to _Section 1.3(d)_ shall be borne
by the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in
proportion to the amounts by which the proposals of the Buyer and the Seller
differed from the Neutral Accountant's final determination.

  



  

(f) The  " _Final Closing Adjustment_ " shall be equal to (i) the
aggregate amount of the Final Closing Adjustment Items (as finally determined
in accordance herewith), minus (ii) the Estimated Closing Adjustment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Final Closing Adjustment may be a positive or
negative number. If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than zero (0),
then, as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than five (5)
Business Days) after the date of determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment, (i) the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint instruction letter instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse
from the Working Capital Escrow Fund the amount of the Final Closing
Adjustment to the Buyer (to the extent of the Working Capital Escrow Fund)

none of Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives shall be
permitted to perform any invasive environmental investigation, including soil

discussion, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Buyer shall not discuss any topics with any such Specified
Customer and Supplier other than such mutually agreed discussion topics
without the Seller's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

is a party or to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being
understood that, if requested by the Buyer, and at the Buyer's expense, the

Buyer shall defend and indemnify the Seller in respect of, and hold it
harmless against and will compensate and reimburse the Seller for, any and
all Damages incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party (regardless

relating to or constituting:

  



  

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of
the Buyer contained in _ARTICLE IV_ or in the Buyer Certificate; or

8.3 _Indemnification Claims_. As used herein, an " _Indemnified
Party_ " shall refer to a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable; _provided_ , that, with respect to any
actions to be taken by an Indemnified Party under this _Section 8.3_ , "
_Indemnified Party_ " shall mean Buyer or Seller, as applicable, and the "
_Indemnifying Party_ " shall refer to the party hereto obligated to indemnify
such Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

 | \- 53 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) _Third Party Actions_. In the event that any Indemnified Party is
made a defendant in or party to any Third Party Action, the Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event, within 45 days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of
such Third Party Action, and such written notice shall describe in reasonable
detail (to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party) the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and the amount of the
claimed damages. No delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in
so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or
liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. At any time
after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written
notice thereof to the Indemnified Party (subject to the rights of an Insurer
under a Transaction Policy to control the defense of Third Party Actions
covered by such Transaction Policy or the rights of the Risk Transfer Company
to control the defense of Third Party Actions covered by the Environmental
Risk Transfer Agreement), assume control of the defense of such Third Party
Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such
defense if (and only for so long as) (A) it irrevocably acknowledges in
writing to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will
indemnify, hold harmless and compensate and reimburse the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ for any Damages assessed against the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Action, (B) it provides
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, as and when
reasonably requested from time to time by the Indemnified Party, that the
Indemnifying Party has Net Cash equal to or greater than an amount equal to
the _ad damnum_ in such Third Party Action, together with the estimated costs
of defense thereof, (C) the Indemnifying Party promptly pays all costs related
to such Third Party Action incurred by the Indemnifying Party as they are
incurred and become due and payable, and (D) an adverse resolution of the
Third Party Action would not have a material adverse effect on the goodwill
or reputation of the Indemnifying Party or the business or operations of
the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Seller may not assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Action involving any Governmental Entity or
criminal liability or in which equitable relief (other than incidental
equitable relief) is sought against the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. If
the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof
to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the Indemnified
Party shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may
participate in (but not control) such defense at its own expense (which, if
the Non-controlling Party is the Indemnified Party, shall not
constitute Damages unless such expense is incurred at the request of the
Indemnifying Party). The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-
controlling Party reasonably advised of the status of such Third Party Action
and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
reasonable recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect
thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with
such non-confidential information as it may have with respect to such Third
Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading
which have been served on such party and any written claim or demand, invoice,
billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of
such Third Party Action. The Indemnifying Party shall, subject (if the
Indemnifying Party is the Seller) to the Indemnifying Party's satisfaction of
the Subrogation Conditions, be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party, except with respect to any rights of the Indemnified Party
against any Key Commercial Partner. The fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered
Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Indemnified Party controls
the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this _Section
8.3(a)_ or (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and
the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to such Third Party Action that cannot be adequately protected,
asserted or otherwise raised by counsel to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to
_Section 8.3(c)_ , neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party
shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment in, any Third
Party Action without the prior written consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that
the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such
settlement or entry of any such judgment, if such settlement or judgment
includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from
all liabilities that are the subject matter of such Third Party Action and
does not provide for, and is not conditioned on, any (x) payment by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (y) non-monetary relief against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (other than
customary confidentiality provisions), or (z) admission of wrongdoing by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, _Section 9.8_ (rather than this _Section 8.3(a)_ )
shall govern any Third Party Action involving Taxes.

  



  

   

 | \- 54 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Direct Actions_. In the event any Indemnified Party seeks to
assert a claim for indemnification against any Indemnifying Party under this
_Section 8.3_ that does not involve a Third Party Action (a " _Direct Action_
"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in
writing that it does not dispute the Direct Action described in such Claim
Notice, the Claimed Amount specified in the Indemnified Party's Claim Notice
shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the
terms herein. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in
writing that it agrees with a portion of the Direct Action described in such
Claim Notice, the Agreed Amount of the Claimed Amount specified in the
Indemnified Party's Claim Notice shall be deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms herein. If the
Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party that it
disputes the Direct Action or fails to notify the Indemnified Party whether
the Indemnifying Party disputes the Direct Action described in such Claim
Notice, in either case, within 45 days of the Indemnifying Party's receipt of
such Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party may pursue its indemnification
rights hereunder and whatever other legal remedies may be available to
enforce its rights under this _Section 8.3_. Acceptance by the Indemnified
Party of partial payment of any Claimed Amount shall be without prejudice to
the Indemnified Party's right to claim the balance of any such Claimed Amount
unless otherwise set forth in a separate written agreement between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 8.3_ , if a
Key Commercial Partner asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit, filed
complaint or similar proceeding) that any Buyer Indemnified Party is liable
to such Key Commercial Partner for a monetary or other obligation and the
Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably determines that it has a valid business
reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) the Buyer Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent
from the Seller, and (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Party may subsequently make a
claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this
_ARTICLE VIII_ , and shall not be precluded from recovering Damages under
this _ARTICLE VIII_ by virtue of fulfilling such obligation (subject to the
right of the Seller to dispute the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party's
entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to
indemnification, under the terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_ ).

  



  

   

 | \- 55 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Subject to _Section 1.3_, any Dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with this _Section 8.3_ and _Section 13.10_. Promptly (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days) following the resolution of the Dispute
(whether by mutual written agreement, final, non-appealable judicial decision
or otherwise), the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount (if any) that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive pursuant to such resolution.

  



  

8.4 _Survival_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 13.9(c)_ , the ability of any Buyer Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party to seek indemnification under  _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ , as applicable, for a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement shall
terminate on the applicable Survival Termination Date, unless such Person
shall have made a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1_ or
_Section 8.2_ , as applicable, therefor prior to such Survival
Termination Date. Subject to _Section 13.9(c)_ , all provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms until the termination date specified below (the applicable "
_Survival Termination Date_ "): (i) the representations and warranties of the
Seller and the Company set forth in _ARTICLE II_ or in _ARTICLE III_ , other
than the Seller Fundamental Representations, shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.

8.1(i)_  shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 31, 2020;

p.m. Eastern time on the date that is 60 days after the expiration of the
longest applicable statute of limitations therefor; (iv) the representations
and warranties of the Buyer set forth in _ARTICLE IV_ , other than the Buyer
Fundamental Representations, shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on

terminate at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date that is 60 days after the

shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 31, 2019; (vii) any
other covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement that is to be
performed at or prior to Closing shall terminate as of, and shall not
survive, the Closing; and (viii) any covenant or other agreement contained in
this Agreement that is required to be performed after the Closing shall
terminate (x) if there is an express period contemplated by its terms, at

the express period contemplated by its terms or (y) if there is no express
period contemplated by its terms, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date that
is 60 days after the expiration of the longest applicable statute of
limitations therefor.

  



  

(b) If the Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice or Expected Claim
Notice to the Indemnifying Party prior to the applicable Survival Termination
Date, then the applicable representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
that are the subject of the indemnification claim in such Claim Notice or
Expected Claim Notice (and only the representations and warranties, covenants,
or agreements that are the subject of any such claim in any such Claim Notice
or Expected Claim Notice) shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the
resolution of the matter covered by such Claim Notice or Expected Claim
Notice, and, in such event, only with respect to the matters set forth in
such Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice. If the legal proceeding or written
claim with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is
definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party, then
the Indemnifying Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnified Party.

(c) Without limiting the proviso at the end of _Section 8.5(b)_ , the
Buyer shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the other Buyer Indemnified
Parties to use commercially reasonable efforts (including the initiation of

who may be responsible (in whole or in part) for any Damages under any
indemnity, contribution or similar agreement, arrangement or legal theory;
_provided_ , that the Buyer shall not be required to initiate litigation as

any component thereof).

  



  

(e) To the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, each
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
all Damages after becoming aware of any event which does, or would reasonably

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the amount of any Damages (for
purposes of calculating any indemnification claim, recovery or obligation
under _Section 8.1_ ) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the related Tax
benefits (if any) that result in an actual reduction of Taxes paid by an
Indemnified Party, determined on a  "with and without" basis, solely for the
taxable year of the occurrence of the Damages giving rise to the
indemnification obligation or the subsequent taxable year (the " _Tax Benefit
Period_ "); _provided_ , that a Tax benefit shall not be treated as having
been actually realized until the applicable annual Income Tax Return has been
filed; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if any such Tax benefit is so actually
realized on an Income Tax Return after an indemnification claim is made
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ but with respect to the Tax Benefit Period, such
Buyer Indemnified Party shall, within sixty (60) days of actually realizing
such Tax benefit, pay to the Seller an amount equal to such Tax benefit
actually realized.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement, including under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ , with respect to any Taxes (or any Damages to the extent
arising out of, resulting from or with respect to such Taxes): (i) resulting
from any transaction or event taken at the direction of the Buyer or any other
Buyer Indemnified Party on the Closing Date following the Closing outside the
Ordinary Course of Business and that is not specifically contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, other than as a direct result of a breach
of any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.9(c)_,
_3.9(f)_ , or _3.9(g)_  or a breach of the representation in _Section
3.17(j)_ or the covenant in _Section 9.9_ , or (ii) due to the
unavailability in any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date of any net operating loss, net operating loss
carryforward, capital loss, capital loss carryforward, Tax credit, Tax credit
carryforward or other Tax asset or attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for or generated or arising in a Tax period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for
purposes of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in the Company
Certificate or the Buyer Certificate and (ii) the amount of Damages for which
any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE
VIII_ , each such representation or warranty (other than the representations
and warranties of the Seller and the Company set forth in the proviso to
_Section 3.5(a)_,  _clause (x)_ of _Section 3.6_ and _Section 3.32_ )
shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications or limitations
as to materiality (including any qualifications or limitations made by
reference to a Company Material Adverse Effect).

  



  

(i) The rights to indemnification set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_ or
under _ARTICLE IX_ shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by or
on behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) by any Buyer Indemnified Party, whether before or after
the date of this Agreement, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the
subject of indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(j) From and after the Closing, except (i) in respect of a dispute
under _Section 1.3(c)_ (which shall be governed by _Sections 1.3(c)_, 
_1.3(d)_ and _1.3(e)_ ), (ii) in cases of Fraud, and (iii) for claims for
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with any
breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, the rights of the
parties under this Agreement, and of the Buyer Indemnified Parties under the
Transaction Policies and the Environmental Risk Transfer Agreement, will
constitute the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of the parties hereto
with respect to any claim arising under this Agreement, whether by contract,

Seller shall have no liability, and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to any indemnification under, this Agreement, including under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ , with respect to any Taxes (or any Damages to the extent

ARTICLE IX 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

9.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date (other than Pre-Closing Tax Returns that are Income Tax Returns).
The Buyer shall provide a copy of (i) each Income Tax Return of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that covers any Straddle Period and (ii) each other Tax
Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries that covers any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that shows any Taxes due and payable for which the Seller will be
required to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement to the Seller for
its review and comment not later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
deadline for filing each such Tax Return in the case of Income Tax Returns and
in such period of time prior to filing as the Buyer determines to be
reasonably practicable in the case of other Tax Returns, and shall make
all changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Seller. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent required by applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as set
forth in _Section 9.1(d)_.

  



  

   

 | \- 61 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer for filing or
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Buyer for filing (and the Buyer
shall timely file) all Pre-Closing Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are Income Tax Returns. The Seller shall provide a copy of
any such Tax Returns to the Buyer for its review and comment not later than
thirty (30) calendar days prior to the deadline for filing each such Pre-
Closing Tax Return, and shall make all changes to such Pre-Closing Tax Returns
reasonably requested by the Buyer. All such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with the past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except to the extent required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as set forth in _Section
9.1(d)_.

  



  

(c) The Buyer shall cause the Tax year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to close as of the end of the Closing Date for U.S.
federal Income Tax purposes by including the Company and its Subsidiaries on
the Buyer's consolidated Tax Return after the Closing Date, and neither the
Buyer nor the Seller shall take any action, or permit any action to be taken,
that would prevent the Tax year of the Company and its Subsidiaries from
ending for state, local and foreign Income Tax purposes at the end of the day
on the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
understand and agree that the Company and its Subsidiaries will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, deduct all Employee Amounts and all other
Transaction Tax Deductions, on their federal Income Tax Return for the Tax
year ending on the Closing Date, and on all state and local Income Tax Returns
for the Tax year ending on the Closing Date or the Straddle Period, as
appropriate.

  



  

(e) If the Buyer and the Seller cannot resolve any disputed item
relating to any Tax Return described in this _Section 9.1_ , the item in
question shall be resolved by the Neutral Accountant as promptly as
practicable, whose determination shall be final and conclusive for purposes
of this _Section 9.1_. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall
be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the
Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the
event that the Neutral Accountant has not resolved the dispute by an
applicable due date of a Tax Return described in this _Section 9.1_ , the
Buyer shall file or cause to be filed the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Return in
such manner as the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return reasonably
determines, and the Buyer shall amend (or cause to be amended) such Tax
Returns to the extent necessary to conform to the Neutral Accountant's final
determination.

9.2 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For all purposes under this
Agreement, the amount of any Taxes (or Tax refund) attributable to the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall: (a) in the
case of any property Tax and other Tax imposed on a periodic basis without
regard to income, receipts, sales, purchases or wages, be equal to the amount
of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such Straddle Period; and (b) in the case of any Taxes not
described in _clause (a)_ of this _Section 9.2_ (including (i) Taxes based on
income or receipts, (ii) Taxes imposed in connection with the sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (including all sales and use taxes), other
than Transfer Taxes described in _Section 9.8_ and (iii) withholding and
employment Taxes), be calculated by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two (2) taxable periods, one (1) which ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date and items of income, gain, deduction, loss
or credit of the Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between
such two (2) taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by
assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the close of business on
the Closing Date;  _provided_ , that any amortization and depreciation
deductions (or similar item determined on an annual or periodic basis) will
be apportioned to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle
Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all purposes of this Agreement, in the
case of Taxes attributable to any partnerships or specified foreign
corporations (within the meaning of Section 965(e) of the Code) in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries hold (with due regard to Section 958 of
the Code) an equity interest as of the Closing Date, including any Taxes
resulting from items included in the income of the Company under Section
951(a) of the Code or Section 951A of the Code, such Taxes shall be allocated
as though the taxable year of the applicable partnership or specified foreign
corporation ended on the Closing Date (without regard to any contrary
provision of Law).

  



  

9.3 _Tax Refunds_. Any cash refund or cash rebate or other cash
recovery of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the amount of any credit taken in lieu thereof and any
interest thereon paid by the applicable taxing authority, to the extent not
taken into account in determining the Final Closing Adjustment (each, a " _Tax
Refund_ ") shall be for the account of the Seller and shall be paid by the
Buyer (or by the Company and its Subsidiaries on behalf of the Buyer) to the
Seller within ten (10) days following receipt thereof, net of any expenses
(including Taxes) incurred by the Buyer in obtaining such Tax Refund. The
Seller shall have no right to Tax Refunds attributable to carryback of losses
from any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date.

  



  

9.4 _Other Actions_. The Buyer shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, amend
any previously filed Tax Returns for the Tax year ending on the Closing Date,
make or change any Tax elections that are effective for any such Tax year,
initiate discussions or examinations with any Governmental Entity regarding
Taxes with respect to any such Tax year, change any accounting method or
adopt any convention that shifts taxable income from a period beginning (or
deemed to begin) after the Closing Date to a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or shifts deductions or losses
from any such Tax year to a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the
Closing Date, in each case if such action would reasonably be expected to
result in an indemnification obligation of the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Seller, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

   

 | \- 63 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.5 _No Section 338/336(e) Elections_. The Buyer shall not and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to (and
shall not permit any such Person to) make an election pursuant to Sections 338
or 336(e) of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

9.6 _Cooperation_. Subject to the other provisions of this _Section
9.6_ , the Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with (a) the
filing of Tax Returns, (b) any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax
Returns and (c) the preparation of any financial statements to the extent
related to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the
other party's request) the provision, of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Legal Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided_ , that the
party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , no party shall be required to provide assistance at
times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the business and
operations of such party.

  



  

9.7 _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer shall be liable for any transfer,
sales, use, stamp, conveyance, real property transfer, recording,
registration, documentary, filing and other non-Income Taxes and
administrative fees (including notary fees) arising in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") whether levied on the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates. The Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in timely
preparing and filing all Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes that are
required to be filed. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
avail itself of any available exemptions from any Transfer Taxes, and shall

documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

  



  

9.8 _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(a) In the event of any claims, audits or other Legal Proceedings with
respect to Taxes by or with a Tax authority that could result in an
indemnification obligation under this Agreement by the Seller (each, a " _Tax
Contest_ "), the Buyer shall promptly (but no later than thirty (30) days
after it or any Affiliate so becomes aware of such Tax Contest) deliver
written notice to the Seller of such Tax Contest (the " _Tax Claim Notice_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay to so notify the
Seller shall not relieve the Seller of any obligation or liability that the
Seller may have to the Buyer, except to the extent that the Seller is
prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(b) With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of the Company for a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date, the Seller (at its sole cost and
expense) may elect to assume and control the defense of such Tax Contest by
written notice to the Buyer within fifteen (15) days after delivery by the
Buyer to the Seller of the Tax Claim Notice; _provided_ , that the Seller
shall not be entitled to control (or retain control of) the defense of such
Tax Contest if the Insurer is required to assume such defense pursuant to the
terms of the RandW Policy. If the Seller properly elects to assume and control
the defense of such Tax Contest within thirty (30) days after delivery by the
Buyer to the Seller of the Tax Claim Notice, then the Buyer shall cooperate

to engage its own counsel and (iii) may (A) pursue or forego any and all

(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the
Seller properly elects to assume (and retains) the defense of any Tax Contest
pursuant to this _Section 9.8(b)_ , then the Seller shall (x) keep the Buyer
reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to the Buyer of any related
correspondence, and shall provide the Buyer with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before the Seller sends such
correspondence to any Tax authority), (y) consult with the Buyer in
connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest and (z)

contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)

Code). Such vote shall establish the disqualified individual's right to the
payment or other compensation, and the Company shall obtain any required
waivers or consents from the disqualified individual prior to the vote. In

Buyer and its counsel shall be given the right to review and comment on all

9.10 _Transaction Tax Benefits_. To the extent that the Buyer, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates
recognizes a Transaction Tax Benefit in either of the first two taxable years
ending after the Closing Date (excluding the taxable year ending on the

to the Seller as such Transaction Tax Benefits are actually recognized by the
Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
within thirty (30) days of the filing any Tax Return for each such taxable
year. For this purpose, a "Transaction Tax Benefit" with respect to a taxable
year means the excess of (A) the Taxes that would have been incurred by Buyer,
the Company and its Subsidiaries for such year (or portion of such year
beginning after the Closing Date), calculated without taking into account the
Transaction Tax Deductions, over (B) the actual Taxes incurred by such
companies in such year (or portion of such year beginning after the
Closing Date), calculated by taking into account such Transaction Tax
Deductions for such year and all prior taxable years (to the extent permitted
by relevant Tax Law and treating such Transaction Tax Deductions as the last
items claimed for any taxable year). Within twenty (20) days after the filing
of any Income Tax Return for the first two taxable years ending after the
Closing Date (excluding the taxable year ending on the Closing Date) that
takes into account any such Transaction Tax Deduction, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount and calculation of any Transaction Tax Benefit recognized during such
taxable year.

  



  

9.11 _Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelters_. The Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not take any action or cause any action to be taken with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries subsequent to the Closing that

transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notice 2001-16, 2001-1 C.B. 730, and Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-20
I.R.B. 2008-6 (January 17, 2008), and Internal Revenue Service Notice

_however_ , this _Section 10.3_ shall not apply to or otherwise limit,
relieve, restrict or affect (a) the representations, warranties, covenants,

10.5 _No Modification of Certain Instruments_. From and after the

the rights of the applicable Insurer or the Risk Transfer Company, as
applicable, to bring a Legal Proceeding against, or otherwise seek recourse
from the Seller, (c) in any manner that would be reasonably likely to reduce
the Buyer's (or its Affiliates') access to the insurance coverage or
indemnification thereunder or cause any coverage or indemnification
thereunder to be more difficult for the Buyer (or its Affiliates) to
access, or (d) that would result in an increased retention or deductible
thereunder, if and solely to the extent such increase would, or would be
reasonably likely to, result in an increase in the liability of the Seller
under this Agreement, in each case without the prior written consent of the
Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

10.6 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Buyer shall
not, and the Buyer shall ensure that the Company and its Subsidiaries do not,
amend, repeal, or modify any provision in the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation,
indemnification, or advancement of expenses of any directors, officers,
members, or managers in any way that diminishes or adversely affects the
exculpation, indemnification, or advancement of expenses provided therein as
of the Closing (unless required by applicable Law), it being the intent of
the parties hereto that the directors, officers, members, or managers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who were directors, officers, members, or
managers prior to the Closing (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") shall
continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification, and advancement
of expenses to the fullest extent provided for under the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents as of immediately prior to the
Closing.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any of the
Company's Organizational Documents, no DandO Indemnified Person shall be
entitled (and the Seller hereby waives on behalf of each DandO Indemnified
Person, and on behalf of each of the successors, heirs, representatives and
assigns of any of the foregoing, any entitlement that any such Person may
have) to any DandO Indemnifiable Claim to the extent such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim constitutes, arises out of or relates to (a) any matter that is the
subject of any claim by or in the right of the Seller or any of its equity
holders or any of their respective Affiliates or (b) any matter for which any
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
(collectively, the claims described in the foregoing _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_
, " _Excluded D andO Claims_").

  



  

   

 | \- 69 -|

(c) At the Closing, the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense,
obtain, maintain, and fully pay for an irrevocable "tail" insurance policy
naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries, with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date, from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company and its
Subsidiaries' current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance and in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Company's and its Subsidiaries' existing policy, with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall not and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to cancel or
change in any manner adverse to any DandO Indemnified Party such insurance
policy. In the event the Buyer, the Company, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, or any of their respective successors or assigns, (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Buyer, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 10.6_. The provisions of this _Section 10.6_ shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and are expressly intended to benefit each of the DandO Indemnified Persons.

maintain the 2018 Bonus Plan of the Company and the base salaries and wages
applicable to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof and (ii) otherwise cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement, and other
compensation and benefit plans, arrangements, and agreements that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than such plans, arrangements and agreements that
are provided by the Buyer as of the Closing to its similarly situated
employees, consultants and other service providers. The Buyer shall take all
actions reasonably required so that eligible employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for all purposes under any successor
employee benefit plans and arrangements established by the Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries). To the extent that
the Buyer modifies any coverage or benefit plans under which the employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries participate, the Buyer shall waive or
cause to be waived any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions, or
actively-at-work requirements and shall give such employees credit under the
new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles, co-payments, and out-of-pocket
payments that have been paid during the year in which such coverage or plan
modification occurs. This _Section 10.7(a)_ shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Buyer, the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

(b) This  _Section 10.7_ is included for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective transferees and permitted assigns and
does not and shall not create any right in any Person, including any employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Company Plan or
any beneficiary or trustee thereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement
(express or implied) (i) is intended to require the Buyer to establish or
maintain any specific Employee Benefit Plan for any length of time, except as
expressly set forth in _Section 10.7(a)_ , (ii) is intended to create a
Company Plan or any Employee Benefit Plan or amend any of the
foregoing, (iii) is intended to confer upon any individual any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time, or any right to a
particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) shall be construed to
indicate existence of employment relations between Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of its service providers (including contractors and
consultants). No continuing employee or other current or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any other Person not a party to this Agreement, shall
have any right, or otherwise be entitled to assert any claim against the
Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates under, this _Section 10.7_.

LLP (" _Prior Company Counsel_ ") has, on or prior to the Closing Date,
represented one or more of the Seller, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees,
directors, members, and managers (each such Person, other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries, a " _Designated Person_ ") in connection with the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(each, an " _Existing Representation_ "), and that, in the event of any post-
Closing matter (i) relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to
a litigation, claim, or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or
such other agreements or in connection with such transactions) and (ii) in
which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and one or more Designated Persons, on the
other hand, are or may be adverse to each other (each, a " _Post-Closing
Matter_ "), the Designated Persons reasonably anticipate that Prior
Company Counsel will represent them in connection with such matters.
Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and on
behalf of the Company and each of the Company's Subsidiaries hereby (A) waives
and shall not assert, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to waive and to not assert, any conflict of
interest arising out of or relating to the representation, by Prior Company
Counsel of one or more Designated Persons in connection with one or
more Post-Closing Matters (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), and (B)
agrees (on behalf of itself and on behalf of the Company and each of the
Company's Subsidiaries) that, in the event that a Post-Closing Matter arises,
Prior Company Counsel may represent one or more Designated Persons in such
Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of such Person(s) may be
directly adverse to the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries).

  



  

   

 | \- 71 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. The Buyer (on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries) waives and
shall not assert, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) to waive and to not assert, any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection, or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any communication between Prior Company Counsel,
on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company (collectively, the "
_Pre-Closing Designated Persons_ "), or any advice given to any Pre-Closing
Designated Person by Prior Company Counsel, in each case to the
extent relating solely to any of the Existing Representations (collectively,
" _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with any dispute between any
Designated Person and one or more of the Buyer and its respective
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all rights to such Pre-Closing
Privileges, and all rights to the waiver or other control of such Pre-Closing
Privilege, shall be retained by the Seller, and shall not pass to or be
claimed or used by the Buyer, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, except as provided in the last sentence of this
_Section 10.8(b)_. Furthermore, the Buyer (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries) acknowledges and
agrees that any advice given to or communication with any of the Designated
Persons included within the Pre-Closing Privileges shall not be subject to any
joint privilege (whether the Company or any of its Subsidiaries also received
such advice or communication) and shall be owned solely by such
Designated Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Buyer, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than a
Designated Person, on the other hand, the Buyer shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, to) assert the Pre-
Closing Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to prevent disclosure
of Privileged Materials to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such privilege may be waived only with the prior written consent of the
Seller.

  



  

(c) _Privileged Materials_. All such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all
books and records and other documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, but only to the extent solely containing any advice or
communication that is subject to any Pre-Closing Privilege ("
_Privileged Materials_ "), shall be excluded from the purchase of the Shares
hereunder, and shall be, and hereby are, distributed by the Company to the
Seller (on behalf of the applicable Designated Persons) immediately prior to
the Closing. In the case of such books and records, Seller shall ensure that
all copies shall have been removed from the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

  



  

10.9 _German Merger Costs and Expenses_. The Buyer shall reimburse the
Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Seller, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries that
would not have been incurred by them but for the German Merger (including all
instruments, documents, notices and filings required or necessary in
connection thereto), including any Taxes and any reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses of outside counsel, accountants or
other consultants payable by the Seller, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries that would not have been incurred by them but for the German
Merger (" _German Merger Expenses_ "), _provided_ , that the German Merger
shall have been consummated.

in _Section 3.14_ of the Disclosure Schedule), is not fully resolved or
settled prior to the Closing, following the Closing, the Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to
resolve or settle the Travelers Litigation (such resolution or settlement to
be subject to the Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Following the Closing, the Buyer shall (x)
keep the Seller reasonably informed of all material developments and filings
relating to the Travelers Litigation, (y) consult with the Seller in
connection with the resolution and settlement of the Travelers Litigation, and
(z) provide the Seller with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any material court filing or settlement or other resolution agreement
before the Buyer (or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) sends such court
filing or settlement or other resolution agreement to opposing counsel or the
court in the Travelers Litigation). Any amounts recovered by the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
resolution or settlement of the Travelers Litigation (in accordance with the
terms of this  _Section 10.10_ ) shall be for the account of the Seller and
shall be paid by the Buyer (or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on
behalf of the Buyer) to the Seller within ten (10) Business Days following
receipt thereof, net of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees,
costs and expenses incurred after the Closing by the Buyer, the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries in connection with the resolution and/or
settlement of the Travelers Litigation (in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 10.10_ ) to the extent such fees, costs and expenses were not taken
into account in the final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment.

13.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claims or disputes
arising out of or related hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby
or to the inducement of either party to enter herein, whether for breach of
contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute or otherwise) shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation, and effect, by and construed in accordance with the internal
Laws of the State of Delaware (including in respect of the statute of
limitations or other limitations period applicable to any claim, controversy
or dispute) without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the State of Delaware.

  



  

13.9 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.5(j)_ with respect to
the period from and after the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one (1) remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a
bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

  



  

(c) Except for _Section 10.3_ , nothing in this Agreement (including
_Sections 2.6_ , _3.33_ and _4.9_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ ) shall, or shall be
deemed or construed to, preclude, limit or impair any claim in respect of,
relieve any Person of any liability or obligation for, or limit or impair any
recourse or remedy of any Person available in respect of, Fraud, whether based
on representations or statements set forth in or outside of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Person may recover duplicative Damages.

13.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Subject to the dispute
resolution procedures in _Sections 1.3(c)_ and _1.3(d)_ , each of the
parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New
Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court
sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (d) agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court, and (e)
waives any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party
hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 13.1_. Nothing in this
_Section 13.10_ , however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

13.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the Buyer and the Seller.

  



  

13.12 _Waiver_. No waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall be
valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party giving
such waiver. No waiver by either party with respect to any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  



  

13.13 _No Recourse against Nonparty Affiliates_. Except in the case
of Fraud, all claims, obligations, liabilities and causes of action (whether
in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected
with or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty
made in, in connection with or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be
made only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly
identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (" _Contracting
Parties_ "). Except in the case of Fraud, no Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
other Representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any
Contracting Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other
Representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the
foregoing (" _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any
claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of,
in connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against all such Nonparty Affiliates,
except in the case of Fraud by any Nonparty Affiliate.

13.14 _Public Disclosure_. The Seller shall not, at any time before
or after the Closing, issue any press release or public statement relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the provision of this
_Section 13.14_ be deemed to restrict or otherwise limit the ability of the
Seller to disclose information regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (a) to its Affiliates, direct and indirect
investors (actual or potential), partners, attorneys, accountants, auditors,
financing sources, or other agents ( _provided_ , that such Persons are bound
by existing, commercially reasonable obligations of confidentiality to the
Seller and the disclosure of such information to such Persons occurs in the
Seller's Ordinary Course of Business), or (b) as required to be disclosed by
applicable Law or in connection with any dispute between the parties hereto;
_provided_ , in each case, that the recipient is informed of the confidential
nature of such information and has been directed to maintain its
confidentiality.

  



  

13.15 _German Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any (a) misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Seller or the Company contained herein, (b)
failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and correct in any
respect, or (c) any breach or default, or failure to perform or comply with
any obligation, covenant, or other agreement to be performed or complied with
by Seller or the Company hereunder, shall, in each case, be disregarded to the
extent it would not have arisen but for the German Merger or the
announcement, pendency or consummation thereof.
