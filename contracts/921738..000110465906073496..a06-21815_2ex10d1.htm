Agreement, Seller shall have the right and option, to be exercised at the
election of Seller in its sole and absolute discretion, to deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Escrow Agent one or more irrevocable standby letters
of credit issued by a commercial bank or banks rated "AA" or higher (as
modified from time to time, the " _Letters of Credit_ ") in favor of the
Escrow Agent with respect to all or a portion of the Escrow Funds then held
by the Escrow Agent on the L/C Delivery Date (as defined below) (the amount
of Escrow Funds with respect to which Seller elects to deliver or cause to be
delivered Letters of Credit, the " _Escrow Funds Replacement Amount,_ " and
the total amount of Escrow Funds held by the Escrow Agent prior to any such
replacement with Letters of Credit, the " _Total Escrow Funds Amount_ "), in
an aggregate initial principal amount (the " _L/C Amount_ ") equal to the
Escrow Funds Replacement Amount. In the event that Seller elects to exercise
the right set forth in this paragraph, Seller shall deliver written notice to
such effect to Buyer and the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days prior
to the estimated date of delivery of the Letters of Credit (the " _L/C
Delivery Date_ ") in accordance with the terms hereof, which notice shall

all investments in the Escrow Fund and distribute all of the cash remaining
in the Escrow Fund to Seller, as instructed by Seller; and (ii) if the Escrow
Funds Replacement Amount is less than the Total Escrow Funds Amount, the
Escrow Agent shall (x) promptly liquidate that portion of the investments
and/or cash in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to the Escrow Funds
Replacement Amount and distribute the same, as instructed by Seller, and (y)
continue to hold all of the investments and cash remaining in the Escrow Fund
after such distribution pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section
2.3(a) and the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement such that,
immediately following the distribution referred to in the immediately
preceding clause (x), the L/C Amount plus the investments and cash remaining
in the Escrow Fund total the Total Escrow Funds Amount. Any Letters of Credit
shall have an expiry no earlier than the Escrow Termination Date and shall
have drawing conditions and other terms, and be in a form, reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and consistent with the terms hereof. If, pursuant to
this paragraph and the Deposit Escrow Agreement, Seller elects to (and does)
deliver one or more Letters of Credit, for all purposes under this Agreement,
the term " _Escrow Fund_ " shall include the amounts available under the
Letters of Credit, and in such case the Escrow Agent shall make each
distribution to be paid to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement (i) first,
by distributing any cash or liquidating any investments held in the Escrow
Funds to permit the making of such distribution, and (ii) then, if the
aggregate amount of such cash and investments is not sufficient to make such
distribution, by drawing against the Letters of Credit, on a pro rata basis
in accordance with the respective principal amount of each Letter of Credit.

     

   

(b) Seller and Buyer agree to execute and be bound by such other reasonable
and customary escrow instructions as may be necessary or reasonably required
by the Escrow Agent or the parties hereto in order to consummate the purchase
and sale contemplated herein, or otherwise to distribute and pay the funds
held in escrow as provided in this Agreement and the Deposit Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , that such escrow instructions are consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the Deposit Escrow Agreement. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and provisions of such supplemental
escrow instructions and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or
any inconsistency between the terms and provisions of the Deposit Escrow
Agreement and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall control, absent an express written
agreement between the parties hereto to the contrary which acknowledges this
Section 2.3(b).

Seller in preparing) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Business
as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The Closing Balance
Sheet will reflect the Adjustments and, except for the Adjustments, will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the unaudited
Financial Information. The Closing Balance Sheet will set forth (i) the
actual amount of Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing Date (the
" _Closing Date Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the actual amount of Cash On
Hand of the Business as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Cash On
Hand_ ").

  

(b) The Closing Balance Sheet, including the Closing Date Working Capital,
shall become final and binding upon the parties unless within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer have been unable to agree on a
final Closing Balance Sheet, including the Closing Date Working Capital, in
which case Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
differences for an additional thirty (30) days. If by the end of the
additional thirty (30) day period such differences have not been resolved,
they shall be resolved by the Chicago, Illinois office of an accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer, and such firmÂ’s opinion thereon and
the resulting Closing Balance Sheet, including the Closing Date Working
Capital, shall be final, binding and not subject to any appeal. The fees and
expenses of such accounting firm in connection with any such resolution shall
be paid one-half (Â½) by Seller and one-half (Â½) by Buyer.

  

(c) Within ten (10) days following the final determination (such date of
final determination, the " _Final Determination Date_ ") of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Working Capital, a final adjustment to the
Total Consideration (the " _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_ ") shall be made
and paid as follows (it being agreed that any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.4(c)(i) and (ii) may, if applicable, be offset against each other):

  

(i) (x) if the Closing Date Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Working Capital, then Seller shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid to
Buyer, in cash, an amount equal to the amount of such difference;
_provided, however,_ that Buyer shall, to the extent that any Escrow
Funds remain available, have the right, at its option, first be paid by the
Escrow Agent from the Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 2.3(a) hereof and

     

   

in accordance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement; and (y) if the Closing Date
Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer
shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid to Seller, in cash, an amount equal
to the amount of such difference; and

  

(ii) (x) if the Closing Date Cash On Hand is less than the Estimated Cash On
Hand, then Seller shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid to Buyer, in cash,
an amount equal to the amount of such difference; _provided, however,_ that
Buyer shall, to the extent that any Escrow Funds remain available, have the
right, at its option, first be paid by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Funds
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) hereof and in accordance with the Deposit Escrow
Agreement; and (y) if the Closing Date Cash On Hand is greater than the
Estimated Cash On Hand, then Buyer shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid to
Seller, in cash, an amount equal to the amount of such difference.

  

(d) As used herein, (i) the term " _Working Capital_ " means the calculation,
using the same methodology set forth on the Reference Balance Sheet, of the
Purchased Current Assets minus the Assumed Current Liabilities, (ii) the term
" _Cash On Hand_ " means all cash, cash equivalents or similar cash items of
Seller held at the Property as of the Closing, including without limitation,
cash contained in the cage, TITO (Ticket-In, Ticket-Out) exchange devices,
slot booths, count rooms and drop boxes at the Property, and (iii) the term "
_Minimum Cash On Hand_ " means Two Million United States Dollars
($2,000,000).

  

(e) Any and all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.4
shall be made by wire transfer or otherwise in immediately available funds in
accordance with instructions delivered by the applicable payee to the
applicable payor prior to the time such payment is required to be made.

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall preclude any party from exercising, or
shall adversely affect or otherwise limit in any respect the exercise of, any
right or remedy available to it hereunder for any misrepresentation or breach
of warranty hereunder, but neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right to
dispute the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Working Capital or the
Closing Date Cash on Hand, or any portion thereof once it has been finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.4(b).

  

Section 2.5 _Allocation of Total Consideration_. The Total Consideration
shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets as shall be mutually agreed
upon between the Buyer and Seller prior to the Closing (the " _Allocation_
") (and each party agrees not to unreasonably withhold or delay its
agreement thereto); _provided_ , that no more than One Million United States
Dollars ($1,000,000) of the Total Consideration shall be allocated to the
covenant not to compete set forth in Section 7.20 hereof. If (i) the Internal
Revenue Service determines to contest the amount allocated pursuant to the
Allocation to the covenant not to complete, then, the defense shall be
jointly controlled by Buyer and Seller (with each party bearing its own
expenses) and such contest shall not be pursued beyond an administrative
appeal proceeding within the Internal Revenue Service; and (ii) upon
final settlement of such contest, Seller is required to allocate more than
One Million United States Dollars ($1,000,000) of the Total Consideration to
the covenant not to compete set forth in Section 7.20 hereof, then Buyer
shall pay Seller an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the excess of the
amount of such allocation over One Million United States Dollars
($1,000,000). The Allocation shall be subject to modification as agreed to

     

   

by Buyer and Seller to reflect the Final Purchase Price Adjustment or any
other adjustment to the Total Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, and
to the extent traceable to a particular Purchased Asset, as agreed to by
Buyer and Seller, shall be allocated to, and thereby increase or decrease as
the case may be, the purchase price of such Purchased Asset. To the extent
that a component of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment or any other
adjustment to the Total Consideration pursuant to this Agreement cannot be
traced to a particular Purchased Asset, such component shall be apportioned
among the Purchased Assets as agreed to by Buyer and Seller. Each party to
this Agreement agrees that it will report the transaction completed pursuant
to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the filing of Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) in accordance with the Allocation, and that no
party will take a position inconsistent with the Allocation unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

  

Section 2.6 _Parent Guarantee_.  Parent Guarantor hereby
guarantees, absolutely and unconditionally, the timely and complete
performance by Buyer of the obligations of Buyer, and the payment by Buyer of
the amounts required to be paid by Buyer, in each case as provided for in
this Agreement and hereby agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and disbursements) which may be paid or
incurred by Seller in enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting
against, Parent Guarantor or Buyer. Parent Guarantor agrees that the
guarantee in this Section 2.6 constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of
collection, and Seller shall not be obligated to initiate, pursue or exhaust
any form of recourse or obtain any judgment against Buyer or others or to
realize upon or exhaust any collateral security held by or available to
Seller before being entitled to payment from Parent Guarantor. The liability
of Parent Guarantor shall not be limited, diminished or affected by (i) any
failure by Seller to file or enforce any claim against Buyer or others (in
administration, bankruptcy or otherwise), or (ii) any other circumstance
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a
guarantor. Parent Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, notice
of dishonor or protest or default, demand for payment upon Buyer or
the undersigned, notice of acceptance, and all other notices and
demands whatsoever. The guarantee set forth in this Section 2.6 is a
continuing guarantee, and it will not be discharged until, and will remain in
full force and effect until, performance or payment in full of all actions
and other obligations of Buyer provided in this Agreement or, if earlier,
termination of this Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE IX. To the extent
this Agreement requires the Buyer to act (or refrain from acting) in
connection with any Federal income tax matter as to which the Buyer is a
disregarded entity, Parent Guarantor guarantees that it shall instead act (or
refrain from acting) in accordance with the BuyerÂ’s obligations hereunder.

Seller does not have any Knowledge that such condemnation or other taking is
threatened or contemplated. Seller has not entered into any agreement in lieu
of condemnation therefor.

     

   

(j) To the Knowledge of Seller, the Property is free of Encumbrances that

procedures relating to privacy, data protection, and the collection and use
of personal information collected, used, or held for use by Seller in the
conduct of the Business (the foregoing, collectively " _Privacy Obligations_
"). No claims have been asserted to Seller in writing or to SellerÂ’s
Knowledge threatened against Seller alleging a violation of any Privacy
Obligations. Seller takes reasonable measures to ensure that such information
is protected against unauthorized access, use, modification, or other misuse.

the Assumed Contracts, whether or not such breach, violation or default has

Contracts, and (iv) no event has occurred with respect to Seller, which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach, violation or
default of, or give rise to a right of termination, modification,
cancellation, foreclosure, imposition of a Lien, prepayment or acceleration
under, any of the Material Assumed Contracts. Section 5.7 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter sets forth, to SellerÂ’s Knowledge, as of the date hereof,
any breach or violation of or default by Seller or any other Person under any
of the Assumed Contracts, whether or not such breach, violation or default
has

     

   

been waived. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall update Section 5.7 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter so that it sets forth, to SellerÂ’s Knowledge, as of
the Closing Date, any breach or violation of or default by Seller or any
other Person under any of the Assumed Contracts, whether or not such breach,
violation or default has been waived.

  

Section 5.8 _Litigation; Orders_.

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, there

(xv) fail to make capital expenditures: (a) to purchase and install the
gaming machines described in Section 7.1(a)(xv) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter or (b) required to be made under any Gaming Law or by any Gaming
Authority; _provided_ , that if Seller fails to make any such expenditures
referred to in the immediately preceding clause (a) or (b), the Purchase
Price payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the difference between (x) the amount that Seller should have
expended pursuant to this Section 7.1(a)(xv) and (y) the amount that Seller
in fact spent.

  

(xvi) close or shut down the Business or the Property, except for such
closures or shutdowns which are (1) required by action, order, writ,

acts of God or other force majeure events;

  

(xvii) delete, damage or erase any Property Specific Data, other than in the

(xviii) fail to file any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period when due,

Section 7.2 _Cooperation; Notice; Cure_. Subject to compliance with applicable
Law (including, without limitation, antitrust Laws and Gaming Laws), from the
date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the
Closing, Seller and Buyer shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with
one or more Representatives of the other party to report on the general
status of ongoing operations of the Property and the Business.  Seller and
Buyer shall promptly notify each other in writing of, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any fact,
event, transaction or circumstance, as soon as practical after it
becomes known to such party, that (a) causes or would reasonably be expected
to cause any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller or
Buyer, respectively, under this Agreement to be breached in any material
respect, (b) renders or could render untrue in any material respect any
representation or warranty of Seller or Buyer, respectively, contained in
this Agreement, or (c) results in or would reasonably be expected to result
in, the failure of such party to timely satisfy any of the closing conditions
specified in ARTICLE VIII hereof, as applicable. Nothing contained in
Section 7.1 hereof shall prevent Seller from giving such notice, using
such efforts or taking any action to cure or curing any such event,
transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this Section 7.2
shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of
determining satisfaction of any condition or any right to, or obligation
of, indemnification contained herein.

  

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) Prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.1 hereof and the Closing, Seller shall not, directly or
indirectly, through any of its officers, directors, employees, financial
advisors, agents or other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_
"; which term, in the case of Seller, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include R. D. Hubbard) or Affiliates (1) solicit, negotiate, respond to or
encourage any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute or may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (2) participate in
any discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any information to any
Person (or group of Persons) other than Buyer or its Affiliates concerning,
or for the purposes of making, or take any other action to facilitate the
making of, any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal, or (3) enter into, approve, agree to or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal.  Seller shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with any persons or entities conducted
heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) Upon execution of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, (i) cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and
all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) exercise any
rights under a confidentiality agreement or similar agreement to request that
any non-public information provided by Seller or its Representatives to any
third party (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal (including any analysis, extracts or summaries thereof)
be destroyed or returned to Seller, to the extent permitted under any such
confidentiality agreement.

     

   

Section 7.4 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer shall make offers of
employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to all Property Employees (with
such offers to Property Employees being, in the aggregate, on substantially
the same terms and conditions of employment as those provided by Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date), other than the Property Employees
that are set forth on Section 7.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Buyer, in its sole discretion, may
interview any or all Property Employees within the thirty (30) day period
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) Buyer shall not be required to make
offers of employment to any Property Employees who the Buyer
reasonably determines it is prohibited from hiring and/or employing under any
applicable Law (including without limitation any Gaming Law). The Property
Employees who timely and properly accept BuyerÂ’s offers of employment shall
commence employment with Buyer effective as of the Closing Date and are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Transferred Employees._ "
Buyer shall not have any obligation to make offers of employment to, or to
otherwise hire or employ, any of the Inactive Employees. Subject to Section
7.4(f) hereof, nothing herein shall restrict Buyer from terminating the
employment, for any reason, of any Transferred Employee following the Closing
Date. Buyer shall not have any liability with respect to any Retained
Employees.

  

(b) With respect to any employee or employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by Buyer (including any severance plan), for all
purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting but not for
purposes of benefit accrual, a Transferred EmployeeÂ’s service with Seller
shall be treated as service with Buyer; _provided, however_ , that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

  

(c) Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, to the extent permitted by
BuyerÂ’s benefit plan, any pre-existing condition limitation under any welfare
benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which
Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing, except to the extent such pre-
existing condition limitation would have been applicable under the comparable
Seller welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall
recognize the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Transferred
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible
and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which
they will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing, to the
extent such deductible and co-payment credits are permitted by BuyerÂ’s
benefit plans.

  

(d) Unless otherwise agreed to prior to the Closing Date between Buyer and
Seller, Seller shall take all steps necessary or appropriate so that each
Transferred Employee shall cease to accrue benefits under its employee
pension benefit plans effective as of the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall take all
action as may be necessary and appropriate to allow each Transferred Employee
who is a participant in the Ruidoso Downs Racing, Inc. Retirement Savings
Plan, as amended (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") to be given the opportunity to elect
to "roll over" his or her account balance to a comparable pension plan
sponsored by Buyer (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), provided such "roll over"
is in accordance with the provisions of such plans and applicable Law.
Following such roll over, Buyer and the

     

   

Buyer 401(k) Plan (or any successor thereto) shall be solely responsible for
all liabilities under the Buyer 401(k) Plan relating to such Transferred
Employees.

  

(e) Unless otherwise agreed to prior to the Closing Date between Buyer and
Seller, Seller shall be responsible for any claims incurred by a Transferred
Employee prior to the Closing Date, under an employee welfare benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Seller, and Buyer shall be responsible for any
claims incurred on or after the Closing Date by Transferred Employees under
an employee welfare benefit plan under which such Transferred Employees may
participate following the Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding
provisions of this paragraph, a medical/dental claim shall be considered
incurred on the date when the medical/dental services are rendered or
medical/dental supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose or
when the course of treatment began; _provided_ , _however_ , that claims
relating to a hospital confinement that begins prior to the Closing Date but
continues on the Closing Date or thereafter shall be treated as incurred
before the Closing Date. Claims of Transferred Employees and their eligible
beneficiaries and dependents for short-term or long-term disability benefits
that arise out of occurrences prior to the Closing Date shall be the sole
responsibility of the Seller and the Seller Benefit Plans. Claims of
Transferred Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents for
short-term or long-term disability benefits that arise out of occurrences on
or after the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of the Buyer.

  

(f) Unless otherwise agreed to prior to the Closing Date between Buyer and
Seller, Seller and its respective Affiliates shall be responsible for any
COBRA obligations (including the provision of any COBRA notices) under
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to any Property Employee who has a
qualifying event occurring prior to the Closing Date or is an MandA Qualified
Beneficiary as defined under Section 54.4980B-9 of the Treasury Regulations.

  

(g) Seller shall transfer to Buyer copies of any records (including, but not
limited to, IRS Forms W-4) relating to withholding and payment of Federal,
state, and local income, disability, unemployment, FICA, and similar taxes
(collectively, " _Payroll Taxes_ ") with respect to wages paid by Seller
during the calendar year of the Closing to the Transferred Employees. In
accordance with Revenue Procedure 2004-53 and comparable state and local
Payroll Tax Laws, (i) Buyer may elect to (but only upon written notice to
Seller no later than 90 days after the Closing, but in no event later than
December 31 of the year of Closing) provide Forms W-2, Wage and Tax
Statements, for the calendar year of the Closing setting forth the aggregate
amount of wages paid to, and Payroll Taxes withheld in respect thereof,
Transferred Employees for the calendar year of the Closing by Seller and
Buyer as predecessor and successor employers, respectively, and (ii) Seller
and Buyer agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection therewith
and with any required notifications and transfers for state unemployment tax
purposes, including experience ratings, employee wage bases and other related
information.

  

Section 7.5 _Access to Information and the Property_.

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable Law, including without
limitation, antitrust Laws and Gaming Laws, Seller shall afford BuyerÂ’s
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period from the date hereof to the Closing, to the Property, including
without limitation, its data center facilities for hardware and software
deployment, training, testing and pre-cutover systems engineering to
facilitate a timely systems

     

   

transition at the Transfer Time, and to all its personnel, properties, books,
Seller Benefit Plans, insurance records, Contracts and records, expressly
excluding, however, the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities, and,
during such period, Seller shall furnish promptly to Buyer all (i) copies of
monthly financial reports and development reports, (ii) when available, the
unaudited financial information related to the Property and the Business for
the nine (9) months ended September 30, 2006 and all subsequent quarterly
periods, (iii) when available, the audited financial information related to
the Property and the Business for the twelve (12) months ended December
31, 2006, and (iv) all other information concerning Seller, the Business,
the Property and the Employees as Buyer may reasonably request (collectively,
the " _Inspection_ ");  _provided, however_ , that (1) Buyer shall provide
Seller with at least twenty-four (24) hoursÂ’ prior notice of any Inspection;
(2) if Seller so requests, BuyerÂ’s Representatives shall be accompanied by a
Representative of Seller; (3) Buyer shall not initiate contact with employees
or other representatives of Seller other than SellerÂ’s Representatives or
other individuals designated by any of SellerÂ’s Representatives without
the prior written consent of SellerÂ’s Representatives, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (4) Buyer shall not unduly interfere
with the operation of the Business; (5) Buyer shall have no right to perform
invasive testing on the Land or Leased Property without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
and (6) Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly repair any damage
to the Property or any other property owned by a Person other than Buyer
arising from or caused by such Inspection, and shall reimburse Seller for,
and indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless with respect to, any loss to
the extent arising directly and solely from or caused by any Inspection (but
not with respect to any pre-existing conditions or contamination at or from
the Property). No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(b) Following the Closing, upon reasonable notice, each of Buyer and Seller
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives, to)
provide the other parties hereto and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives with reasonable access and duplicating rights, during normal
business hours and on reasonable notice, to all of BuyerÂ’s and SellerÂ’s
personnel, properties, books, insurance records, Seller Benefit Plans,
contracts, commitments and records related to the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Employees and shall cooperate with the requesting
party, as reasonably necessary for such requesting party to pursue any suit,
claim, action, proceeding or investigation relating to the claims in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, to
prepare any Tax Returns, or for any other proper purpose, including, without
limitation, any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation related to
the Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities, Retained Employees and Transferred
Employees and Buyer shall provide reasonable services of the Transferred
Employees to assist Seller in preparing any required Tax Returns and
financial books and records of Seller for any period that includes
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller shall
provide Buyer with at least twenty-four (24) hoursÂ’ prior written notice;
(ii) if Buyer so requests, SellerÂ’s Representatives shall be accompanied by a
Representative of Buyer; (iii) Seller shall not interfere with the operation
of the Business; and (iv) Buyer shall not be required to incur any costs in
connection with the rights granted to Seller in this Section 7.5(b).

     

   

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to provide any
information which (i) they reasonably believe they may not provide to the
requesting party or its respective Affiliates and Representatives by reason
of applicable Law or by a confidentiality agreement with a third party, and
if, in the case of a confidentiality agreement, the non-requesting party has
used commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require any party
hereto to incur any material cost or other monetary obligations to any third
party) to obtain the consent of such party to such disclosure, or (ii)
constitutes information protected by the attorney/client or attorney work
product privilege or both. If any material is withheld by the non-requesting
party pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such non-requesting
party shall inform the requesting party as to the general nature of the
material which is being withheld.

  

(d) Each of Buyer and Seller will hold and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to hold any information furnished, revealed or otherwise made
known to it pursuant to Section 7.5(a) or (b) hereof by Seller or Buyer,
respectively, which is nonpublic, in confidence and in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement dated August 1, 2006 between Seller and Parent
Guarantor (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect thereafter.

  

Section 7.6 _Governmental Approvals_.

  

(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable, take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do or cause to be done, all
things necessary under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions governed by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders, including
without limitation, BuyerÂ’s Gaming Approvals, required (A) to be obtained or
made by Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives, and (B) to avoid any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in connection with
the HSR Act and antitrust and competition Laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction), in each case in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions with respect to this
Agreement, as required under (A) any applicable federal or state securities
Laws, (B) the HSR Act and antitrust and competition Laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction, (C) the Gaming Laws and (D) any other applicable Law
((A), (B), (C) and (D), collectively, the " _Governmental Approvals_ "), and
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Approvals.
The parties hereto and their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall
file (x) within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, all required initial
applications and documents in connection with obtaining the approvals under
applicable Gaming Laws, (y) within forty-five (45) days after the date
hereof, all required initial applications and documents in connection with
obtaining approvals with respect to the HSR Act and antitrust and competition
Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, and (z) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, all Governmental Approvals other than
those set forth in clauses (x) and (y) above; _provided_ , that Buyer, Seller
and each of their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall re-make any
such filings required to be made at a later date in the event that any
previously made filing lapses or such re-filing is otherwise required by any
Governmental Entity. With respect to all filings, the parties hereto and
their respective

     

   

Representatives and Affiliates shall act diligently and promptly to pursue
the Governmental Approvals, including, without limitation, filing such
additional applications and documents as may be required, and shall cooperate
with each other in connection with the making of all filings referenced in
the preceding sentence, including providing copies of all such documents to
the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
schedule and attend any hearings or meetings with Governmental Entities to
obtain the Governmental Approvals as promptly as possible. Buyer and Seller
shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult the other parties hereto on, in each case, subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (including, without
limitation, antitrust laws and any Gaming Laws), all the information relating
to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives which appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions governed by this Agreement.

  

(b) Without limiting Section 7.6(a) hereof, Buyer and Seller shall:

  

(i) each use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date,
including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
any court by any Person; and

  

(ii) each use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Closing
so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date), including implementing, contesting
or resisting any litigation before any court or quasi-judicial administrative
tribunal seeking to restrain or enjoin the Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
be required to commit to any divestitures, licenses or hold separate or
similar arrangements with respect to its, or their respective assets or
conduct of business arrangements.

  

(c) Buyer and Seller shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions governed by this Agreement
which causes such party to reasonably believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such consent or approval from such Governmental Entity will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.  Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to defend
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions governed by this Agreement, seeking to
prevent the entry by any Governmental Entity of any decree, injunction or
other order challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions governed by this Agreement, appealing as promptly as possible
any such decree, injunction or other order and having any such decree,
injunction or other order vacated or reversed.

     

   

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each party shall
promptly notify the other party hereto in writing of any pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, threatened action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity
or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking damages in connection with the
Closing or any of other transaction governed by this Agreement, or (ii)
seeking to restrain, delay or prohibit the consummation of the Closing.

  

Section 7.7 _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer shall agree on the form and content
of the initial press release regarding the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereafter shall consult with each other before issuing, provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon and use all
reasonable efforts to agree upon, any press release or other public statement
with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and prior to considering in good faith any such comments, except
as may be required by applicable Law (including without limitation the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any Gaming Laws) or any listing
agreement with, or the rules and regulations of, the NASDAQ Stock Market or
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and Seller or their
respective Affiliates may make any public statement in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Buyer and Seller and do not
reveal non-public information regarding Buyer or Seller.

  

Section 7.8 _Further Assurances and Actions_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each party hereto agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, using their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to obtain all Seller Permits and consents of parties

particular to Buyer, Buyer shall bear the cost of such action.

the Purchased Assets and as soon as reasonably practicable deliver to Buyer
(i) any mail, packages and other communications addressed to Seller relating
to the Purchased Assets and (ii) any cash or other property that Seller

respect of, or otherwise satisfy when due, all Assumed Current Liabilities,
other than those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall make prompt payments
when due in respect of, or otherwise satisfy when due, all accounts payable
of Seller and all other Excluded Current Liabilities, other than those which
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. In respect of
expenses that are accrued in whole or in part prior to the Closing Date,
which become payable after the Closing Date and which do not appear on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet, such expenses
shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Closing Date on the
Final Determination Date. Within ten (10) days of the Final Determination

casualty shall be borne and assumed by Seller. If, prior to the Closing, any
portion of the Property is damaged by earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood,
landslide, fire, acts of war, terrorism, terrorist activities or other
casualty, and such casualty, destruction, loss or damage does not result in a
Casualty Termination Event, then Seller shall promptly repair or replace such
damaged Property to substantially the same condition as, or better condition
than, it was immediately prior to such casualty, destruction, loss or damage.
In the event that it is not feasible to complete the repair or replacement
prior to the Closing Date, the Closing shall proceed as scheduled and Seller
shall, as of the Closing Date, (i) promptly pay to Buyer all insurance
proceeds received by Seller or its Affiliates to date with respect to such
casualty, destruction, loss or damage, less any proceeds applied to the
physical restoration of the Property; _provided_ , that if such insurance
proceeds are not sufficient for Buyer to repair or restore the Property to
substantially the same condition as it was in immediately prior to such
casualty, destruction, loss or damage, Seller shall pay Buyer an additional
amount equal to such shortfall (the " _Shortfall Amount_ "); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if any such insurance proceeds

     

   

remain unused after Buyer has repaired or restored the Property to
substantially the same condition as it was in immediately prior to such
casualty, destruction, loss or damage, then Buyer shall remit to Seller
an amount equal to such remaining unused insurance proceeds; and (ii) assign
to Buyer all rights of Seller and its Affiliates against third parties (other
than against its insurance carriers) with respect to any causes of action,
whether or not litigation has commenced as of the Closing Date, in connection
with such casualty, destruction, loss or damage; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the proceeds of such insurance shall not be subject to any applicable
deductibles and co-payment provisions, which shall be the responsibility of
Seller and shall be paid to Buyer or applied to such repair or replacement as
applicable; and _provided, further,_ that any recovery of money from any
third Person pursuant to the rights conveyed under this subsection (ii) shall
be paid, following the payment of BuyerÂ’s out of pocket fees and expenses, to
Seller until Seller has been repaid the Shortfall Amount. The obligations of
Seller pursuant to the prior sentence shall constitute full compensation for
the damage to the Property, and, after the Closing, Seller shall have no
responsibility for restoration or repair of the Property or any resultant
loss, directly, by subrogation, or otherwise.

  

(b) If, prior to the Closing, any portion of the Property is damaged by
earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, landslide, fire, acts of war,
terrorism, terrorist activities or other casualty, and such casualty,
destruction, loss or damage results, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Casualty Termination Event, then Buyer shall have fifteen (15) days from the
date upon which it receives a notice from Seller indicating that a Casualty
Termination Event may have occurred to exercise its termination right under
Section 9.1(g) hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if requested
by Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall discuss and consult in good faith for a
period of up to thirty (30) days after any such casualty, destruction, loss
or damage to determine whether such casualty, destruction, loss or damage
(individually or together with any prior casualties) actually constitutes a
Casualty Termination Event; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Buyer makes
such request, Buyer shall have an additional fifteen (15) days after the
expiration of such period to exercise its termination right under Section
9.1(g) hereof with respect to such casualty. In the event that Buyer elects
not to exercise its termination right under this Section 7.15(b) and Section
9.1(g) hereof, then the provisions of Section 7.15(a) hereof shall apply as
if such casualty, destruction, loss or damage did not result in a Casualty
Termination Event.

  

(c) If, prior to the Closing, all or any Material Portion of the Property is
taken by condemnation, eminent domain, or payment in lieu of condemnation (or
is the subject of a pending or contemplated taking which has not been
consummated), Seller shall immediately notify Buyer of such fact. In such
event, Buyer shall have the option to exercise its termination right under
Section 9.1(g) hereof upon written notice to Seller given not later than
thirty (30) days after BuyerÂ’s receipt of such notice from Seller. If Buyer
does not elect to terminate this Agreement or if the taking is not of a
Material Portion of the Property, Seller shall assign and turn over to Buyer,
and Buyer shall be entitled to receive and keep, all awards for such taking
and Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Property subject to the taking
without reduction in the Purchase Price.

  

Section 7.16 _No Control_. Except as permitted by the terms of
this Agreement, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not directly or
indirectly control, supervise, direct or interfere with, or attempt to
control, supervise, direct or interfere with, the Property. Until the
Closing, the

     

   

operations and affairs of the Property and the Business are the sole
responsibility of and under SellerÂ’s complete control, except as provided for
in this Agreement.

visitors to the Property and customers of the Business kept, maintained or
stored by Seller, including without limitation any and all copies, notes,
compilations, studies, summaries and analyses of the Customer Database and
all other documents which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in
part, the Customer Database, or any derivatives of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Customer Information_ "), and (ii) permanently destroy
and securely erase any Customer Information recorded on any electronic media,
optical device or other storage device that is not included in the Purchased
Assets, except as is necessary to maintain the Customer Database and to
permit Seller to comply with its obligation set forth in Section 4.2(h)
hereof; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Seller shall take all actions required in the Ordinary Course of Business to
maintain and keep updated the Customer Database after the date hereof and
until and including the Closing Date.

  

(b) If the revenues of the Business for any quarter in the period commencing
with the first day of the first quarter after the Closing Date occurs and
ending on the last day of the quarter in which the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date occurs decline by ten percent (10%) or more
from the revenues of the corresponding quarter of the prior year, Buyer shall
have the right, at any time during such period or within a reasonable period
of time thereafter, to select a mutually agreeable third party to conduct an
audit of the records of Seller and any of its Affiliates and to carry out
such other procedures as such third party may deem necessary to confirm that
Seller has fully complied with its obligations under this Section 7.17(b).
Seller shall promptly provide such third party with access during normal
business hours and on reasonable notice to all of SellerÂ’s and its
AffiliateÂ’s personnel, books, records, properties and other

the Property to qualify as a "motorsports entertainment complex" within the
meaning of Section 168(i)(15) of the Code (including without limitation, in
the case of (i) above, all such reasonable action and acts of preparation by
Seller and its Affiliates as would reasonably enable Buyer and its Affiliates
to cause the Property to so qualify after the Closing).

  

Section 7.19 _Non-Solicitation_.

  

(a) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing

their employment (such conduct is collectively referred to as

     

   

"solicitation") any employees of the Business or Seller or any persons who
left their employment in connection with the Business or ceased working for
Seller or at the Business or the Property in the aforementioned capacity less
than six (6) months prior to the solicitation, except for those individuals
listed in Section 7.19(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. The immediately

Persons referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, (y) the hiring,
soliciting, recruiting or other such action of any Person who responds to
such a general solicitation described in the preceding clause (x), or (z) the

thereof, as of a date that is prior to August 7, 2006); _provided_ , that
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from
marketing to any Person in the Customer Database who (x) initiates gaming or
racing activities at any of the other properties or facilities of Seller or
any of its Affiliates, including Ruidoso Downs, and prior to such activities,
Seller has not breached the terms of this Agreement with respect to such
Person, or (y) is contacted by Seller or its Affiliates as part of a general
marketing campaign without use of the Customer Information.

  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, Section
7.19(a) hereof and Section 7.19(b) hereof shall cease to have any force or
effect upon and following such termination.

  

Section 7.20 _Non-Competition_. Until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof and the date that is five (5)
years following the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (or commence any activities to)
build, manage, control, work for, provide services to, engage in, or commence
activities to purchase, plan, develop, or own any interest in, any business
involving gaming or racing activities located within a 125 mile radius of the
Property, or make, directly or indirectly, any application to a Gaming
Authority in connection with any of the foregoing. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, this Section 7.20 shall cease to
have any force or effect upon and following such termination. As provided in
Section 2.5 hereof, a portion of the Total Consideration not exceeding One
Million United States Dollars ($1,000,000) shall be allocated to the rights
or obligations under this Section 7.20.

  

Section 7.21 _Amended Ground Lease_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
request from lessor under the Existing Ground Lease, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver at Closing, an Amended Ground Lease, the terms
of which (i) shall provide that the term of the Amended Ground Lease shall be
for a minimum duration of ten (10) years following the Closing Date, (ii)
shall approve the transfer of the Existing Ground Lease to, and assumption
thereof by, Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) shall not contain any
differences from the terms of the Existing Ground Lease which are materially
adverse to Seller or Buyer. Notwithstanding

     

   

anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall be solely responsible for any
assignment fee incurred pursuant to Paragraph 11 of the Existing Ground Lease
or similar such provision in the Amended Ground Lease and any other fees and
expenses in connection with delivering the Amended Ground Lease.

  

Section 7.22 _Domain Names_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take

Section 7.23 _Pre-Closing Financial Statements_. Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer as soon as available (the

practices) following the end of each month true and complete copies of
(i) the unaudited balance sheet, statement of income and cash flow
statement relating to the Property and the Business (x) for each of the
monthly periods starting with the month immediately following the last
monthly period covered by the Financial Information and ending with the month
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) for each day of the month of
the Closing Date, from the beginning of such month until the Closing Date (or
such other financial information as would be consistent with past practices
relating to such days of the month if financial statements relating to the
same would not be available in the Ordinary Course of Business), and (ii) the
audited balance sheet, statement of income and cash flow statement relating
to the Property and the Business for the twelve (12) month period ending

Financial Information_ "). Except as noted therein and except for normal
period-end adjustments and the lack of footnotes, the Pre-Closing Financial
Information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect at the time
of such preparation applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements) and shall fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Business as of such date and for such
period, subject to normally recurring year-end audit adjustments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that such Pre-
Closing Financial Information shall be prepared by Seller or its Affiliates
for internal purposes, reflects allocation of some but not necessarily all
costs incurred by Affiliates of Seller for its benefit, and that no
representation or warranty is made that Buyer will be able to operate the
Property or the Business for the costs reflected in the Pre-Closing Financial
Information.

Parties_ ") from and against any and all costs, losses, Liabilities,
obligations, damages, claims, demands and expenses (whether or not arising
out of third party claims), including interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement
of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Damages_ "), incurred in connection
with, arising out of or resulting from:

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement (without giving effect to any qualifiers or exceptions relating to
knowledge, materiality or Property Material Adverse Effect);

Parties_ ") from and against any and all Damages incurred in connection with,

Section 10.3 _Interpretation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the term Damages shall not include any consequential,
special or incidental damages, claims for lost profits, or punitive or
similar damages.

     

   

Section 10.4 _Procedure for Claims between Parties_. If a claim for Damages
is to be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
entitled to indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written notice
briefly describing the claim and the total monetary damages sought (each, a "
_Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") as soon as practicable
after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, circumstance,
condition or event which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification
may be sought under this ARTICLE X. Any failure to submit any such notice of
claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of
any Liability hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was
materially prejudiced by such failure.

  

Section 10.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If any lawsuit or enforcement
action is filed against an Indemnified Party by any third party (each, a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification under this ARTICLE X may be
sought, Notice thereof shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly
as practicable. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely Notice
hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party was materially prejudiced by such failure.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so elects at its own cost,
risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and investigation of
such Third Party Claim, (ii) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice
( _provided_  that such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party) to handle and defend the same, unless the Indemnified
Party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more
legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying Party, in which
event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying PartiesÂ’
reasonable cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel to defend against only
such claims for which there may be one or more legal defenses available to
such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party ( _provided_ that such counsel is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and (iii) to compromise or
settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only (x) with
the written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (y) if such compromise or settlement
contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
with the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, at its own
cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or
action and any appeal arising therefrom. In the case of a Third Party Claim
in respect of Taxes, (i) at the request of the Indemnified Party, the defense
shall be jointly controlled by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party (the reasonable costs of such defense to be borne by the Indemnifying
Party), and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any
such Third Party Claim without the Indemnified PartyÂ’s prior written consent.
The parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers.
If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such claim within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Notice, the Indemnified Party
against which such claim has been asserted will have the right to undertake,
at the Indemnifying PartiesÂ’ reasonable cost, risk and expense, the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the Indemnifying Parties; _provided, however_ , that
such claim shall not be compromised or settled

     

   

without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement.

  

Section 10.6 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

  

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall seek, or be entitled to, indemnification
from any of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 10.2(a) hereof
unless and until the aggregate claims for Damages of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 10.2(a)
hereof are greater than Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
($500,000) (the " _Threshold_ ") and then only for the excess over the
Threshold but not in excess of Ten Million United States Dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the Cap
nor the Threshold shall be applicable to any claims for Damages of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for which indemnification is sought with respect to
(i) Section 5.1, Section 5.2(a), Section 5.18, Section 7.17, Section 7.20,
Section 10.2(a)(iii) or Section 10.2(a)(iv) hereof, (ii) any liability for
Tax in respect of which a claim may be made hereunder, or (iii) fraud or
willful misconduct of Seller or willful breach of this Agreement by Seller.

  

(b) In calculating the amount of any Damages payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of the Damages (i)
shall not be duplicative of any other Damage for which an indemnification
claim has been made and (ii) shall be computed net of any amounts actually
recovered by such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect
to such Damages (net of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such insurance proceeds). If an Indemnifying Party pays an
Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently insurance proceeds in respect
of such claim are collected by the Indemnified Parties, then the Indemnified
Party promptly shall remit the insurance proceeds (net of any out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds) to
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to obtain from any applicable insurance company any insurance proceeds in
respect of any claim for which the Indemnified Parties seek indemnification
under this ARTICLE X, _provided, however_ , that an Indemnified Party shall
have no obligation to initiate, pursue or exhaust any remedies against any
insurance policy or proceeds prior to seeking indemnification under this
ARTICLE X.

  

Section 10.7 _Payment of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall be paid in cash
by an Indemnifying Party the amount to which such Indemnified Party may
become entitled by reason of the provisions of this ARTICLE X, within five
(5) Business Days after such amount is determined either by mutual agreement
of the parties or on the date on which both such amount and an Indemnified
PartyÂ’s obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final
judgment of a court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such
proceeding; _provided, however,_ that any Buyer Indemnified Party shall, to
the extent that any Escrow Funds remain available, first be paid by the
Escrow Agent from the Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 2.3(a) hereof and in
accordance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

  

Section 10.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the indemnities
provided in this ARTICLE X shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
any Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of, resulting from or incurred
in connection with any claims regarding

     

   

matters arising under or otherwise relating to this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that this exclusive remedy for Damages does not preclude a party
from bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable remedy to
require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller each hereby waive (and, by their
acceptance of the benefits under this Agreement, each Buyer Indemnified Party
and Seller Indemnified Party hereby waives), from and after the Closing, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud, willful misconduct or willful breach of this
Agreement) such party may have against the other party arising under or based
upon this Agreement or any schedule, exhibit, Disclosure Letter, document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, and no legal action sounding in
tort, statute or strict liability may be maintained by any party (other than
a legal action brought solely to enforce the provisions of this ARTICLE X).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.8, in the event
of fraud or willful misconduct of, or willful breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein by, Buyer or Seller, any
Indemnified Party shall have all remedies available at law or in equity with
respect thereto.

  

Section 10.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall be treated by
the parties for income Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

 **ARTICLE XI**

  

 **PROPERTY**

  

Section 11.1 _As Is_. Buyer or its Representatives have fully examined and
inspected the Purchased Assets prior to the execution of this Agreement, and
subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE XI, Buyer agrees to accept the
Purchased Assets in an "AS IS" condition as of the Closing. Buyer agrees
that, except as provided in ARTICLE V hereof, Buyer is not relying upon any
representations, statements, or warranties (oral or written, implied
or express) of any officer, employee, agent, Affiliate or Representative
of Seller, or any salesperson or broker (if any) involved in this transaction
as to the Purchased Assets, including, but not limited to: (a) any
representation, statements or warranties as to the physical condition of the

for use as a race track and/or casino; (c) the past, current or future
financial performance of the Purchased Assets; (d) the compliance of the
Purchased Assets with applicable Laws, including building, zoning,
subdivision, environmental, or land use Laws, codes, ordinances, rules or
regulations; (e) the state of repair of the Purchased Assets, including,
without limitation, the Improvements; (f) the value of the Purchased Assets;
(g) the manner or quality of construction of the Purchased Assets; (h) the
income derived or to be derived from the Purchased Assets; or (i) the fact
that the Purchased Assets may be located on earthquake faults or in seismic
hazardous zones. Buyer, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives any
right to assert any claim against Seller, at Law or in equity, relating to
any such matter, whether latent or patent, disclosed or undisclosed, known or
unknown, in contract or tort, now existing or hereafter arising, except with
respect to the representations and warranties in ARTICLE V hereof.

     

   

Section 11.2 _Title to Real Property_.

  

(a) _Title Insurance Commitmen_ t. Buyer agrees to accept (i) the Title
Commitment and the UCC-11 Search attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ , subject to
the removal of all exceptions that have been marked-out and all objections
and other matters that have been noted therein, and (ii) that certain as-
built survey, dated October 30, 2006, issued by Pettigrew and Associates,
made in accordance with ALTA / ACSM minimum technical standards and the Laws
of the State of New Mexico, certified to Buyer (and its nominees), Title
Insurer and any other persons or entities as Buyer may reasonably request,
showing the entire Land, all adjoining streets and roads (including, without
limitation, the points of ingress and egress thereto), the location by metes
and bounds and the exact dimensions of the Land, a legal description of the
Land, the exact location of all Improvements, set back lines, protrusions,
encroachments and easements (to the extent locatable) on and upon the Land,
together with all rights-of-way (to the extent locatable) and other matters
relating to the Land (the " _Survey_ "), as evidence of the status of
SellerÂ’s title to the Land.

  

(b) _Defects_. Buyer agrees to accept title to the Land subject to all
matters shown by the Title Commitment attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ ,
subject to the removal of all exceptions that have been marked-out and all
objections and other matters that have been noted therein, and the Survey,
subject to the removal of all exceptions and other matters that have been
marked-out and all objections that have been noted in the Title Commitment.
Seller shall take all reasonable action necessary to remove from title to the
Land, or, in the alternative, shall obtain for Buyer title insurance from the
Title Insurer, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
insuring over, the exceptions or matters that have been marked-out or noted
in the Title Commitment or UCC-11 Search attached hereto as _Exhibit J_.
**** Title defects will not be deemed to include any matters shown by the
Title Commitment or UCC-11 Search attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ , except
with respect to the exceptions that have been marked-out and the objections
and other matters that have been noted therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to provide to
Buyer, to the extent reasonably available, such additional information as
Buyer may reasonably request to determine the status and effect on the Land
and Improvements of the Encumbrances referenced as Exceptions 17, 23, 25 and
26, (ii) to cooperate with Buyer in causing the Encumbrance referenced as
Exception 23 on Schedule B Part II to the Title Commitment to be relocated of
record and (iii) to provide to Buyer, to the extent reasonably available,
such additional information as Buyer may reasonably request to determine
whether the Improvements located within the hazard area designated as Flood
Zone AO-1, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were built in
accordance with all building codes and regulations that apply to improvements
built in such an area. The Title Commitment and UCC-11 Search shall be
updated at or shortly before Closing. If the updated Title Commitment or
UCC-11 Search shows defects in title not shown by the Title Commitment or
UCC-11 Search, or, if the Land or SellerÂ’s interest therein, should become
subject to a lien or other financial encumbrance, and Seller has received an
itemized written notice of such defects within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of delivery of the updated Title Commitment or UCC-11 Search to
Buyer or, if earlier, the Closing Date, Seller shall take all reasonable
action necessary to remove from title to the Land any exceptions and matters
so objected to by Buyer, or, in the alternative, Seller shall obtain for
Buyer title insurance from the Title Insurer insuring over such exceptions or
matters, such insurance to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer. Failure to notify Seller within the specified period of title
defects revealed

     

   

by the updated Title Commitment or UCC-11 Search shall be deemed a waiver of
BuyerÂ’s right to disapprove of the status of SellerÂ’s title, and Buyer shall
then accept such title as is described in the Title Commitment and UCC-11
Search (except with respect to all exceptions that have been marked-out and
all objections that have been noted therein) as updated, without reserving
any claim against Seller for title defects. In order to cure a Monetary
Encumbrance or to attempt to cure any other title defects, Seller shall have
the option to extend the Closing Date for a period of thirty (30) days, by
giving written notice of such extension election to Buyer at or before the
Closing Date. Cure of Monetary Encumbrances shall be effected by the payment
and release of such Monetary Encumbrance of record. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) Seller
shall discharge and remove any and all Liens affecting the Land that are
shown by the Title Commitment or UCC-11 Search, as the same may be updated,
which secure an obligation to pay money (other than installments of real
estate taxes not delinquent as of the Closing), even though Buyer does not
expressly disapprove of the same, and (ii) Seller shall be obligated to cure
all monetary encumbrances that are not disclosed by the Title Commitment or
UCC-11 Search (other than governmental taxes and assessments and the
encumbrances created or suffered by Buyer) which are unpaid and liquidated at
Closing (the " _Monetary Encumbrances_ "), if any, which encumber the
Property or the Business or SellerÂ’s interest therein between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing, in the manner provided below.

  

(c) _Failure to Cure Title Defects_.  If Seller fails to discharge and
remove all liens which secure an obligation to pay money or to cure the
Monetary Encumbrances that it is obligated to cure in accordance with Section
11.2(b), such failure shall be a default by Seller subject to the remedies of
ARTICLE IX. If Seller is not successful in its efforts to cure or remove any
other material title defects it is obligated to cure in accordance with
Section 11.2(b) on or before the Closing Date, or the end of the extension
period, if elected, then this Agreement shall, at the option of Buyer (to be
exercised by written notice to Seller no later than the original or extended
Closing Date, as applicable), be terminated, Escrow Agent shall return the
Deposit to Buyer and Buyer and Seller shall be released and discharged from
any further obligation to each other hereunder; _provided,_ that if Buyer so
elects, Buyer may accept such title as is tendered by Seller without
reduction in the Purchase Price, or reservation of claim against Seller.

  

(d) _Survey_. Buyer shall have the right to cause the Survey to be
recertified to Buyer, Title Insurer and any other Persons as Buyer
may reasonably request, at or shortly before the Closing Date. If the
recertified Survey reveals any matters not shown on the existing Survey, then
such disclosure shall be a title defect as to which the provisions of
Section 11.2(b) and Section 11.2(c) shall govern BuyerÂ’s and SellerÂ’s rights
and obligations.
