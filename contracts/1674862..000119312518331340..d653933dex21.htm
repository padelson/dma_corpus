ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 2.1 _Transferred/Excluded Assets; Transferred Company Equity
Interests; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities_.

 

(a) _Transferred Assets_. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, (i) Seller will, and will cause
the Asset Selling Corporations to, sell, assign, transfer, convey, and deliver
to Buyer (or its applicable Affiliates), and Buyer (or its applicable
Affiliates) will purchase, acquire and accept, the Transferred Assets
and (ii) Seller will cause the Entity Selling Corporations to sell, assign,
transfer, convey, and deliver to Buyer (or its applicable Affiliates), and
Buyer (or its applicable Affiliates) will purchase, acquire and accept, the
Transferred Company Equity Interests, in each case of subparts (i) and (ii)
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.
Accordingly, Seller will, or will cause the other Selling Corporations to,
execute and deliver at the Closing, as applicable, a general copyright
assignment in the form of _Exhibit C_ (the " _Copyright Assignment Agreement_
"), a general domain name assignment in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the " _Domain
Name Assignment Agreement_ "), a general assignment and bill of sale in the
form of _Exhibit E_ (the " _General Assignment Agreement_ "), a general patent
assignment in the form of _Exhibit F_ (the " _Patent Assignment Agreement_

Selling Corporations, for transfer to Buyer or the designated Buyer
Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed undated blank stock powers) with
appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed, in each case to convey to Buyer
all of the Selling Corporations right, title and interest in and to the
Transferred Assets and the Transferred Company Equity Interests. Seller shall
bear all risk of loss with respect to the Transferred Assets and the
Transferred Company Equity Interests (in 

 



-21- 

    

 each case, whether or not covered by insurance) up to the time of the
Closing, whereupon such risk of loss with respect to the Transferred Assets
and the Transferred Company Equity Interests shall pass to Buyer.

(b) _Excluded Assets_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer
is not purchasing pursuant to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby any right, title or interest in any Excluded Asset.

(c) _Assumed Liabilities_. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume (or cause its
applicable Affiliates to assume) the Assumed Liabilities and shall agree to
satisfy and discharge when due the Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates
that are Assumed Liabilities as defined in _Annex B-1_; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be released from any Liability
hereunder if it assigns any of its rights or Liabilities hereunder to any
Buyer Corporation or any third party or causes its applicable Affiliates to
assume the Assumed Liabilities. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for the
performance by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any Assumed Liability the
performance of which by, or on behalf of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates is
not accepted by the obligee in the exercise of such obligees lawful rights.
After the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Assumed Liabilities
as and when such Liabilities become due. Buyer will execute and deliver, and
will cause any applicable Affiliates to execute and deliver, to Seller at the
Closing an assumption agreement in the form of _Exhibit H_ (the " _Assumption

assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any Excluded
Liability as defined in _Annex B-2_.

on the date of this Agreement the Buyer shall transmit to each of the Excepted
Selling Corporations a Local Offer Letter. If the Local Offer Letter is
accepted by the applicable Excepted Selling Corporation at the Closing (i)

applicable Excepted Selling Corporation will, sell, convey, assign and
transfer to Buyer and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept
those Transferred Assets and/or those Transferred Company Equity Interests
that are the subject of the Local Offer Letter and (ii) Buyer will assume
those Assumed Liabilities that are the subject of the Local Offer Letter, in
each case pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and the applicable Business Transfer Documents.

(f) _Business Transfer Documents_. To the extent required or desirable under
applicable foreign Law to effect the transactions contemplated hereunder, the
parties shall execute and deliver or cause their respective Affiliates to
execute and deliver such stock, asset and/or business transfer agreements,
bills of sale, deeds, assignments, assumptions and other documents and
instruments of sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and assumption (the "
_Business Transfer Documents_ ") as are necessary to effect any sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, and delivery of the Transferred Assets, the
Transferred Company Equity Interests or the Employees or any assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities in each territory set forth on _Annex_  

 



-22- 

    

  _H_ (which annex may be updated or modified from time to time by agreement
of Buyer and Seller) at the Closing. The Business Transfer Documents shall be
in form and substance reasonably agreed to by the parties and as is usual and
customary in the applicable jurisdiction; _provided_ that, the parties agree
and acknowledge that the Business Transfer Documents are intended solely to
formalize the terms and conditions of this Agreement in order to comply with
any applicable foreign Law and shall be, in all respects, consistent with the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement and a Business Transfer Document, this
Agreement shall control.

(g) _Transferred Assets and Transferred Company Equity Interests Subject to
Third Party Consent_. To the extent that the sale, conveyance, assignment or
transfer or attempted sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer to Buyer or a
Buyer Corporation of any Transferred Asset or Transferred Company Equity
Interest is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
governmental or third party Consents and such Consents shall not have been
obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale,
conveyance, assignment or transfer, or an attempted sale, conveyance,
assignment or transfer thereof. During the period commencing on the date
hereof and continuing until one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing,
(a) each of Buyer, the Buyer Corporations and the Selling Corporations
shall provide or cause to be provided to the other parties all commercially
reasonable assistance as is reasonably requested in connection with securing
such Consents, and (b) if any Consents are not secured prior to the Closing,
pending the earlier of obtaining such Consent or the expiration of such one
hundred eighty (180) day period, Buyer, the Buyer Corporations and the Selling
Corporations shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in any
lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by either Buyer or
Seller under which Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall obtain the benefits and
obligations of use of any such Transferred Asset or the ownership of any such
Transferred Company Equity Interest held by the Seller Affiliate following
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Selling Corporation shall be
required to pay any consideration therefor, or to commence, defend or
participate in any Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party; _provided_ _further_ that Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any
and all Losses arising out of or relating to any Transferred Asset or
Transferred Company Equity Interest held by any Selling Corporation for the
benefit of Buyer or any Buyer Corporation pursuant to any arrangement
established pursuant to clause (b), to the extent related to any period of
such arrangement. If such Consent is obtained, Seller shall assign, convey
and transfer any such Transferred Asset or Transferred Company Equity Interest
to Buyer at no additional cost. If such Consent is not obtained within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing, Seller will be deemed to have
fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement and under no circumstances
shall the Consideration be reduced or Seller or its Affiliates be subject to
any Liability on account of the failure to obtain any such Consent. Buyer
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller
contained in this Agreement shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition to Buyers obligations to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied as a result of (x) the failure
to obtain any such Consent or as a result of any resulting default or
termination or (y) any Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of
any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consent or
any resulting default or termination.

 



-23- 

    

(h) _Certainty of Closing_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Closing has not occurred within two hundred forty (240) days of the date
hereof due to a failure to obtain Consents required to meet the Closing
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, or due to any Proceeding
instituted by any Governmental Authority preventing the consummation of
the Acquisition, then: (A) the parties shall amend this agreement (the "
_Amended Agreement_ ") to remove the inclusion of any and all Transferred
Assets, Transferred Company Equity Interests or assets and properties of the
Transferred Entities which would otherwise have the effect of delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Retained Assets_ "); (B) Buyer shall take any and all steps necessary to
promptly obtain (but in any event within two hundred seventy (270) days of
the date hereof) any Consents that may be or become necessary to allow the
parties to close the transactions contemplated by the Amended Agreement, which
steps will include promptly making all filings and notifications, if any, to
any applicable Governmental Authority and providing all appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested; _provided_ that nothing in the Amended Agreement shall
require Buyer to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order, mitigation agreement or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of any interest, product lines or assets of INEOS Group or
the assets and interests being acquired under the Amended Agreement, nor
require Buyer to otherwise take or commit to take actions that after
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Amended Agreement would
limit INEOS Groups freedom of action with respect to any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of INEOS Group or the assets and interests being
acquired under the Amended Agreement; and (C) the parties will close the
transactions contemplated by the Amended Agreement within two hundred seventy
(270) days of the date hereof with no reduction to the Consideration. It is
acknowledged and agreed that the parties shall each pay one-half of any filing
fee required in connection with any filing or notification made to any
applicable Governmental Authority pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(h)(i)(B)_.

 

(ii) After the Closing, Seller shall continue to operate the Retained Assets
in a commercially reasonable manner, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to sell, divest or dispose of the Retained Assets at
Buyers sole cost and expense on terms and conditions substantially similar to
the terms and conditions set forth herein; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be permitted to sell the Retained
Assets on terms and conditions that Seller believes, in its sole judgment but
acting reasonably, are the most favorable terms that have been offered to
Seller in respect of the assets;  _provided_ _further_ that Seller agrees not
to sell, divest or dispose of the Retained Assets for a price less than the
book value of the Retained Assets as of the date of this Agreement. Seller
shall permit Buyer, at Buyers option and expense, to participate in the
negotiation of any such sale, divestiture or disposal, but Seller shall retain
sole authority to make all determinations regarding the terms and conditions
of the sale. Upon the receipt of any purchase price for the divestiture of
the Retained Assets, Seller shall notify Buyer and, within five (5) Business
Days of receipt of wire instructions from Buyer, wire such funds to Buyer. If
Seller is unable to sell, divest or dispose of the Retained Assets within
eighteen (18) months, Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer at an amount equal to
the book value of the Retained Assets as of the date of this Agreement.

 



-24- 

    

(i) _Buyer s Recording and Similar Responsibilities_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, it shall be Buyers
responsibility (i) to prepare the applicable Copyright assignments, Patent
assignments and Trademark assignments and to record such
assignments following execution thereof by Seller or an Asset Selling
Corporation at the Closing and (ii) to bear all fees, duties and other costs
payable in connection with (A) the transfer of the Business IP and (B) the
recording and registration of title to the Transferred Assets and Transferred
Equity Interests in the name of Buyer, the Buyer Corporations and their
Affiliates.

 

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price at Closing_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay (or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates as Buyer may designate to pay), on behalf of Buyer and the Buyer
Corporations, to Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller may
designate), on behalf of Seller and the other Selling Corporations, an amount
equal to U.S.$1,100,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), which amount shall
be adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. The Purchase Price shall be
paid in immediately available funds by wire transfer in accordance with
written instructions given by Seller to Buyer not less than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing or such later time as may be agreed by Seller and
Buyer. Following the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be subject to further
adjustment as provided for in _Sections 2.3_ and _2.4_.

 

(b) On or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated
Statement_ ") setting forth good faith estimates of the following amounts: (i)
the Net Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net
Indebtedness_ "), (ii) the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), and (iii) the Net Funded Level as of the
Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net Funded Level_ "). The Estimated Statement
shall be unaudited and, with respect to the Estimated Net Indebtedness, the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the components thereof, prepared consistent
with the Closing Account Principles.

 

(c) The Purchase Price specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ to be paid at the
Closing shall be:

 

(i) (A) increased, if the Estimated Net Indebtedness is a negative number, on
a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount equal to the absolute value of the
Estimated Net Indebtedness or (B) decreased, if the Estimated Net Indebtedness
is a positive number, on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount equal to the
Estimated Net Indebtedness;

 

(ii) (A) increased, if the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds
U.S.$135,000,000 (the " _Net Working Capital Target_ "), on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by the amount of such excess or (B) decreased, if the Estimated
Net Working Capital is less than the Net Working Capital Target, on a dollar-

-25- 

    

(iv) decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount equal to the

the transactions listed on _Annex K_ shall be paid as set forth on _Annex K_.
With respect to any transaction listed on _Annex K_ in which an Affiliate of
Buyer is to pay Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in a currency other than
dollars (or in which Buyer is required to convert dollars into another

Affiliate of Seller in dollars), the exchange rate to be used in determining
the amount of such local currency (or dollars) to be paid in respect of the
Transferred Assets or Transferred Company Equity Interests transferred in such
transaction shall be equal to the exchange rate actually received by
such Affiliate of Buyer in obtaining such local currency (or dollars);

Section 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment following Closing for Net Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness_.

 

(a) Within ninety-five (95) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement (in its draft form, the " _Price Adjustment
Statement_ "), setting forth (i) the Net Working Capital transferred to Buyer
(the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the Net Indebtedness (the "
_Closing Net Indebtedness_ "), in each case as of the Effective Time, which
statement shall include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how
such amount was calculated on an entity-by-entity basis. The Price Adjustment
Statement shall be unaudited and prepared in accordance with Sellers
accounting principles set forth on _Annex I_  (the " _Closing Account
Principles_ "). To the extent that the Closing Net Working Capital is greater
than or less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ below. To the extent
that the Closing Net Indebtedness is greater than or less than the Estimated
Net Indebtedness, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as described in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_ below. The Price Adjustment Statement shall be in the
form of _Schedule 2.3(a)_ , which sets forth an example of the calculation of
Net Working Capital and Net Indebtedness as of June 30, 2018.

 

(b) In connection with the preparation and review of the Price Adjustment
Statement, (i) Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to
assist, Seller, its accountants, advisors and other Representatives in
Sellers preparation of the Price Adjustment Statement and (B) afford to
Seller, its accountants, advisors and other Representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and
records of the Business in the possession of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
the extent relevant to the preparation of the Price Adjustment Statement
(including any taking and preparing of physical counts of Inventory) and (ii)
Seller shall afford to Buyer, its accountants, advisors and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
personnel, properties, books and records of the Business in the possession of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent relevant to the review of the
Price Adjustment Statement.

(c) The Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the sixtieth (60th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless
Buyer gives written

 



-26- 

    

 notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior
to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify (i) in reasonable
detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted; (ii)
disagreements with respect to (and only with respect to) (A) whether the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Net Indebtedness was
prepared in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, specifically, whether
the Closing Account Principles were used, and (B) whether there were
mathematical errors in the Price Adjustment Statement; and (iii) the amount
that Buyer reasonably believes is the correct Closing Net Working Capital or
Closing Net Indebtedness, as applicable, based on the disagreements set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement, including a reasonably detailed description of
the adjustments applied to the Price Adjustment Statement in calculating such
amount. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the
Price Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y)
below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x)
the date the parties hereto resolve any differences they have with respect to
any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date BDO USA LLP
or, if BDO USA LLP is unable or unwilling to serve, another accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (such firm, the " _Accounting Firm_
") delivers the final Price Adjustment Statement to the parties (in accordance
with the procedure set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_).

(d) During the thirty (30) day period immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences they may have with respect to any matter specified
in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30) day period,
Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and resolution by the Accounting
Firm any and all matters that were included in the Notice of Disagreement and
remain in dispute, and the Accounting Firm shall make a final determination of
the values set forth on the Price Adjustment Statement (and shall use such
determination to prepare the final Price Adjustment Statement), which
determination shall be binding on the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , the
scope of such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to: (i)
those matters that remain in dispute and that were included in the Notice of
Disagreement (including any sub-matters subordinate to a larger included
matter), (ii) whether such calculation was prepared in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ (including related definitions of defined terms used
herein), specifically, whether the Closing Account Principles were used, and
(iii) whether there were mathematical errors in the Price Adjustment
Statement, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any
other determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as
to the accuracy of _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or any other representation or
warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller or any of its
Affiliates with any of the covenants in this Agreement (other than this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_). The determinations of the Accounting Firm shall be
final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error. Judgment may be
entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in the Delaware Court
of Chancery or any other court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall be borne one-half
each by Buyer and Seller.

(e) A party claiming that any other party has failed to comply with its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ to provide access to information may
initiate the appointment of the Accounting Firm by making a written request
directly to BDO USA LLP. If any party initiates the appointment of
the Accounting Firm under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_, the Accounting Firm
shall have the authority: (i) to determine if a party has complied with its
obligations to provide

 



-27- 

    

 access to the information required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ and
to order that a party comply with any such obligations; (ii) to extend any
deadlines set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, including the immediate
temporary suspension of such deadlines during the time period necessary to
resolve the disputed issue; and (iii) to allow a party the right to amend any
prior Price Adjustment Statement or Notice of Disagreement where it finds
that such party had been prejudiced by the failure to have been provided
access to such information.

 

(f) If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that Closing Net Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the amount of such
excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase Price. If
the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Closing Net
Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the
Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of
such deficit. If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the
Closing Net Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital,
then there shall be no adjustment under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ to the
Purchase Price.

 

(g) If the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that Estimated Net
Indebtedness exceeds the Closing Net Indebtedness, then the amount of such
excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase Price. If
the final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that Estimated Net Indebtedness
is less than the Closing Net Indebtedness, then the Purchase Price shall be
reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficit. If the
final Price Adjustment Statement discloses that Estimated Net Indebtedness is
equal to Closing Net Indebtedness, then there shall be no adjustment under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_ to the Purchase Price.

 

(h) No payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ need be made by either
party until the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after the
determination of the final Price Adjustment Statement (the " _Price Adjustment
Due Date_ "); _provided_ that on or before the Price Adjustment Due Date,
Buyer or Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by
such party) shall pay or cause to be paid to the other party (or one or more
of its Affiliates as may be designated by such party), in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in
writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Price Adjustment Due Date
by the party receiving payment, cash in dollars in an amount equal to the
aggregate Purchase Price adjustment under  _Sections_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ and
_2.3(g)_ , if any, together with interest on such amount from the Closing Date
to the date of such payment, at a rate equal to the Interest Rate on the
Closing Date.

 

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment following Closing for Net Funded
Level_.

 

(a) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare, or shall have prepared by a third party engaged by Seller at
Sellers sole cost and expense, and deliver to Buyer a statement (in its draft
form, the " _Net Funded Level Statement_ ") setting forth the Net Funded Level
determined as of the day prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the
Transferred Employees who participated in the applicable Transferred Non-U.S.
Seller Pension Plans as of the day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Net Funded Level_ "), which statement shall include a worksheet setting forth
in reasonable detail how such amount was calculated on an entity-by-entity
basis. To the extent that the Closing Net Funded Level is

 



-28- 

    

 greater than or less than the Estimated Net Funded Level, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_ below.

 

(b) In connection with the preparation and review of the Net Funded Level
Statement, (i) Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to
assist, Seller, its accountants, advisors and other Representatives in
Sellers preparation of the Net Funded Level Statement and (B) afford to
Seller, its accountants, advisors and other Representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and
records of the Business in the possession of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
the extent relevant to the preparation of the Net Funded Level Statement and
(ii) Seller shall afford to Buyer, its accountants, advisors and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
personnel, properties, books and records of the Business in the possession of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent relevant to the review of the
Net Funded Level Statement.

(c) The Net Funded Level Statement shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the sixtieth (60th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer
unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Net
Funded Level Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Net
Funded Level Disagreement shall specify (i) in reasonable detail the nature
and amount of any disagreement so asserted, (ii) disagreements with respect to
(and only with respect to) (A) whether the calculation of the Closing Net
Funded Level was prepared in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
(including related definitions of defined terms used herein) and (B) whether
there were mathematical errors in the Net Funded Level Statement and (iii) the
amount that Buyer reasonably believes is the correct Closing Net Funded Level
based on the disagreements set forth in the Notice of Net Funded Level
Disagreement, including a reasonably detailed description of the adjustments
applied to the Net Funded Level Statement in calculating such amount. If a
timely Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement is received by Seller, then the
Net Funded Level Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y)
below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x)
the date the parties hereto resolve all differences they have with respect to
all matters specified in the Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement or (y)
the date Willis Towers Watson or, if Willis Towers Watson is unable or
unwilling to serve, another independent actuary upon which Seller and Buyer
shall mutually agree (the " _Actuary_ ") delivers the final Net Funded Level
Statement to the parties (in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_).

(d) During the thirty (30) day period immediately following the delivery of
a Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to
any matter specified in the Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement. At the
end of such thirty (30) day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review
and resolution by the Actuary any and all matters that were included in the
Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement and remain in dispute, and the Actuary
shall make a final determination of the values set forth on the Net Funded
Level Statement (and shall use such determination to prepare the final Net
Funded Level Statement), which determination shall be binding on the parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , the scope of such determination by the Actuary shall
be limited to: (i) those matters that remain in dispute and that were included
in the Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement (including any sub-
matters subordinate to a larger included matter), (ii) whether such
calculation was prepared in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and
(iii) whether there were mathematical errors in the Net Funded Level
Statement, and the Actuary is not

 



-29- 

    

 authorized or permitted to make any other determination. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Actuary is not authorized or permitted to
make any determination as to the accuracy of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller or any of its Affiliates with
any of the covenants in this Agreement (other than this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_).
The determinations of the Actuary shall be final and binding, absent fraud,
bad faith or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Actuary in Delaware Court of Chancery or any other court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Actuary pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.4_ shall be borne one-half each by Buyer and Seller.

 

(e) A party claiming that any other party has failed to comply with its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_ to provide access to information
may initiate the appointment of the Actuary by making a written request
directly to Willis Towers Watson. If any party initiates the appointment of
the Actuary under this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)_, the Actuary shall have the
authority: (i) to determine if a party has complied with its obligations to
provide access to the information required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_
and to order that a party comply with any such obligations; (ii) to extend
any deadlines set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, including the immediate
temporary suspension of such deadlines during the time period necessary to
resolve the disputed issue; and (iii) to allow a party the right to amend any
prior Net Funded Level Statement or Notice of Net Funded Level Disagreement
where it finds that such party had been prejudiced by the failure to have been
provided access to such information.

 

(f) If the final Net Funded Level Statement discloses that the Closing Net
Funded Level is less than the Estimated Net Funded Level, then the amount of
such deficit shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase
Price. If the final Net Funded Level Statement discloses that the Closing Net
Funded Level exceeds the Estimated Net Funded Level, then the Purchase Price
shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess. If
the final Net Funded Level Statement discloses that the Closing Net Funded
Level is equal to the Estimated Net Funded Level, then there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of the Closing under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_.

 

(g) No payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ need be made by either
party until the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after the
determination of the final Net Funded Level Statement (the " _Net Funded Level
Price Adjustment Due Date_ "); _provided_ that on or before the Net Funded
Level Price Adjustment Due Date, (i) Buyer or Seller (or one or more of its
Affiliates as may be designated by such party) shall pay or cause to be paid
to the other party (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by
such party), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more
bank accounts designated in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Net Funded Level Price Adjustment Due Date by the party receiving such
payment, cash in dollars in an amount equal to the Purchase Price adjustment
under _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_, if any, together with interest on such amount
from the Closing Date to the date of such payment, at a rate equal to the
Interest Rate on the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.5 _Holdback Taxes_. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth
Sellers good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of Holdback Taxes (the "
_Estimated Holdback Tax Amount_ "), calculated as of the last day of the most
recent calendar month prior to such date. If the Estimated Holdback

 



-30- 

    

 Tax Amount is in excess of five million dollars (U.S.$5,000,000), Seller and
Buyer shall (i) hold back the Estimated Holdback Tax Amount from the Purchase
Price to be paid at Closing, and (ii) cooperate and negotiate with each other
in good faith to make any necessary amendments to this Agreement regarding the
holdback, payment and settlement of any Holdback Taxes and the settlement of
the Estimated Holdback Tax Amount (including payment to Seller of any excess
amounts thereof), all within a reasonable time after the Closing Date.

Section 2.6  _Allocation of the Consideration_.

(a) (i) No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a proposed allocation for Tax, financial
accounting and all other purposes that (A) allocates the Purchase Price plus
any Assumed Liabilities treated as purchase price for Tax purposes (the "
_Tax Consideration_ ") among the Transferred Assets and the Transferred
Company Equity Interests as of the Effective Time separately and on an entity-
by-entity, country-by-country and asset-class-by-asset-class basis, and (B) is
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, the regulations promulgated
thereunder and any similar, applicable provisions of state, local or foreign
Law (as modified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, the " _Allocation_ ").

 

(ii) No later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following Buyers receipt of
a proposed allocation pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(i)_, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller, in writing, any good faith objections to such proposed
allocation. If Buyer does not deliver to Seller any such objections pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_, the allocation proposed by Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(i)_ shall become the Allocation. If Buyer
delivers to Seller any such objections pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)(ii)_:

(A) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate with one another in good faith to
agree upon an allocation that is in accordance with _Sections 2.6(a)(i)(A)_
and _(B)_ , and any such allocation agreed upon by the parties in writing
prior to the Closing Date shall become the Allocation (it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that reaching such agreement shall not be a
condition to Closing); and

(B) if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon an allocation pursuant to
clause (A) above, then (1) prior to the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
prepare a written schedule of the portions of a proposed allocation of the Tax
Consideration that they have agreed upon to date, if any, which schedule
shall be final and binding on the parties and (2) subject to _Section_ __ _
2.6(c)_, and to the extent not inconsistent with the Allocation (and the
schedule described in clause (1), if applicable), each party hereto shall be
entitled to use its own allocation of the Tax Consideration as such party
deems appropriate.

(iii) Seller and Buyer shall allocate the Net Working Capital Target among
the Seller Affiliates on an entity-by-entity basis.

 

(b) Seller (i) shall amend the Allocation (and the schedule described in

Date to reflect, to the extent not already reflected, (A) any Purchase Price
adjustments made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ and (B)

  



-31- 

    

 the Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Net Indebtedness and Estimated
Net Funded Level, (ii) shall amend the Allocation (and the schedule described
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)(B)(1)_, if applicable) to reflect (A) any
payments made pursuant to _Sections 2.3_ and _2.4_ , (B) the Net Working
Capital and Net Indebtedness set forth in the Price Adjustment
Statement finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and (C) the Net Funded
Level set forth in the Net Funded Level Statements finalized pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and (iii) may amend the Allocation (and the schedule
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)(B)(1)_, if applicable) to reflect any
adjustments to the Consideration under this Agreement for Tax purposes not
described in clause (i) or (ii), in each case in a manner reasonably
consistent with the circumstances giving rise to such payments or adjustments
(as applicable) and with the review and negotiation procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_.

 



(c) Except as required by applicable Law, (i) Seller and Buyer shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, (A) act in accordance with
the Allocation (and the schedule described in _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)(ii)(B)(1)_, if applicable) for all purposes, including with respect to
any forms or reports (including IRS Form 8594) filed pursuant to Section 1060
of the Code, Treasury Regulations or any other provisions of applicable Law,
(B) cooperate in the preparation of any such forms or reports and (C) timely
file such forms or reports in the manner required by applicable Law and (ii)

Affiliates not to, take any position that is inconsistent with either the
Allocation or the schedule described in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)(B)(1)_ if
applicable in any communication (whether written or unwritten) with any
Governmental Authority.

 

(d) In the event that either the Allocation or the schedule described in
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)(B)(1)_ if applicable is disputed by any Taxing
Authority, (i) the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify
the other party hereto of such notice, (ii) both Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to defend the Allocation (and the schedule
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)(B)(1)_, if applicable) in all Tax
Contests and similar Proceedings and (iii) the dispute shall be deemed to be
an Applicable Tax Contest for purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 9.9(b)_ and shall
be governed by the procedures for Applicable Tax Contests in such subsection
(and not those for third party claims in _Section_ __ _ 10.6_).

 

Section 2.7 _Withholding_. Seller, Buyer, the Transferred Entities and their
Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable
pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement any Taxes required to be
withheld and deducted under applicable Law, and to the extent amounts are so
withheld or deducted, such amounts shall be treated as having been paid to
the applicable Person with respect to whom such withholding or deduction was
made; _provided_ , _however_ , that such applicable Person must be given
reasonable notice prior to any such withholding.

Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) (i) With respect to the Employees, except for Contracts listed in
_Schedule 5.18(b)(i)_ (the " _Union Contracts_ "), none of the Transferring
Corporations is a party to or is bound by any material union contract or
collective bargaining agreement, nor, to the Knowledge of Seller as of the

Seller Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of

sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by any
Transferred Entity, other than (i) any Retained U.S. Seller Benefit Plan, and

Affiliate nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any director, officer, employee,
stockholder, agent or Representative of any such Person, has directly or

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller the following:

 

Section 6.1 _Organization_. Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of England and Wales, and has
full power and authority to own its properties and carry on its business in
the places where such properties are now owned or such businesses are now
being conducted, except where the absence of such power and authority would
not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to Buyer, taken as a
whole. Each Buyer Corporation is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (to the extent such concept is known in the relevant jurisdiction)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization) and each Buyer
Corporation has full power and authority to own its properties and carry on
its business in the places where such properties are now owned or such
businesses are now being conducted, except where the absence of such power
and authority would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to
such Buyer Corporation, taken as a whole.

 

Section 6.2 _Authority; Binding Effect_.

 

(a) Buyer has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement. Buyer and
each of the Buyer Corporations has full power and authority to enter into the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and to perform its respective
obligations hereunder and thereunder (as the case may be). This Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer and any of the Buyer Corporations is
a party have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate or
other action.

(b) Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Seller, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and legally binding
obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by 

 



-48- 

    

 bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general equity principles. Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements by each
Seller Affiliate party thereto (as the case may be), each Ancillary Agreement
to be executed by Buyer or a Buyer Corporation, when delivered hereunder, will
be duly and validly executed and delivered and will constitute a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Buyer or the relevant Buyer Corporation, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general equity principles.

Section 6.3  _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
and the execution, delivery and performance by each Buyer Corporation of the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and the consummation of the
Acquisition, do not and will not (i) violate any provision of the
organizational documents of Buyer or the relevant Buyer Corporation, or (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters set forth in _Sections 5.4_ and _6.5_ ,
violate or result in a breach of or constitute a default under any Law or
Order to which Buyer or any Buyer Corporation is subject.

 

Section 6.4 _Securities Act_. The Transferred Company Equity Interests are
being acquired for investment only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof, and neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall offer
to sell or otherwise dispose of the Transferred Company Equity Interests so
acquired by it in violation of any of the registration requirements of the
United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Section 6.5 _Buyer Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and the execution and delivery of the
Ancillary Agreements by each of Buyer and the relevant Buyer Corporations, and
the performance of their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder do
not and will not require any filing with, or clearance, consent or approval
of, any Governmental Authority, except filings, clearances, consents or
approvals pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation, other Competition
Laws or the failure of which to effect or obtain would not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.6 _No Litigation_. As of the date of hereof, no Proceeding is
pending against, or to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing against
Buyer or any Buyer Corporation, which would restrain, prohibit, invalidate,
set aside, rescind, prevent or make unlawful this Agreement or the carrying
out of this Agreement and the Acquisition.

Section 6.7 _Brokers_. Except with respect to Valence Group, no broker, finder
or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Acquisition based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Buyer.

Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Seller a guarantee, dated the date hereof
and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I, of the Affiliate Guarantor
guaranteeing Buyers obligations hereunder (the " _Affiliate Guarantee_ ")
upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the Affiliate Guarantee. The
Affiliate Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid, legal, binding
and enforceable obligation of the Affiliate Guarantor. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute
a default on the part of the Affiliate Guarantor under its

 



-49- 

    

 Affiliate Guarantee. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be construed
to limit in any way Sellers right to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 12.16_.

 

Section 6.9 _Buyer_ __ _s Investigation_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE_ __
_ V_, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, THE BUYER CORPORATIONS AND
THEIR AFFILIATES, THAT NO SELLER AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE

expressly set forth in _Article V_. Buyer represents that no Seller
Affiliates, or their respective Representatives or any other Person, have

Liabilities not expressly set forth in _Article V_ , Seller Affiliates will
not have, or be subject to any Liability to Buyer or any other Person

_however_ that Seller, and one or more of Sellers Affiliates, shall take
all steps necessary to terminate any relevant tax group (Organschaft)

Agreement(s)_ ") to be entered into by the parties (or their applicable
Affiliates) in due course prior to the Closing Date, taking into account
all reasonable tax, accounting and legal aspects being relevant for the
parties. However, subject to any additional and/or different agreement under
such German PLTA Termination Agreement(s), as of the date hereunder, the
parties agree that the Seller will procure that the respective profits and
loss transfer agreements will be mutually terminated ( _einvernehmlich
aufgehoben_ ) by the respective parties and, therefore, in principal agree
that (A) the fiscal year of each of ISP Marl GmbH and Ashland Technologies
GmbH shall be amended to end at 24 CET hours on the German Closing Date, (B) a
required approval of the relevant Taxing Authority in respect of the amendment
of the fiscal year shall be obtained and the amendment of the respective

agreements shall be carried out in cash and actual funds after the German

respectively, shall pay to ISP Marl Holdings GmbH any amounts to be
identified as finally payable under the terminated profit and loss transfer
agreements and ISP Marl Holdings GmbH shall pay to ISP Marl GmbH and Ashland
Technologies GmbH, respectively, any amounts to be identified as finally
payable under the terminated profit and loss transfer agreements, in each
case as the case may be). For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of the
relevant profit and loss transfer agreements and, as the case may be, the
transfer of the Transferred German Company Equity Interests, shall be
performed in line with the principles of a midnight transaction (
_Mitternachtsgesch aft_) according to R14.4(2) Corporate Income Tax
Guidelines;

 



-53- 

    

(xii) other than in the ordinary course of business, amend (A) the India

prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from taking actions, including (i)
contributions, transfers, distributions, redemptions, assignments and
acceptances of assets and Liabilities, (ii) the repayment of Indebtedness and
the extinguishment of Encumbrances, (iii) formation, dissolution or divisive
transactions (including a spin-off or split-off) of subsidiaries, including
Transferred Entities and (iv) the cancellation of any intercompany Contracts
that will not constitute Transferred Contracts, in each case as Seller
determines is reasonably necessary or appropriate to facilitate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

(d) From the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the Closing or
the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, with
respect to any purchase of any of the Transferred Equity Interests or any
assets of the Transferred Entities or the Business (other than with respect to
a Permitted Transaction) (each such transaction, a " _Competing Transaction_
"), Seller shall not, and shall cause the Transferred Entities and the
respective Affiliates or Representatives of Seller and the Transferred
Entities not to, directly or indirectly (i) provide any nonpublic information
to any Person (including via access to any data room or other records) other
than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives with respect to any
Competing Transaction, (ii) solicit, initiate or encourage proposals, offers
or inquiries from any Person other than Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives with respect to any Competing Transaction, (iii) participate
in any negotiations or discussions with any Person other than Buyer and its
Affiliates and Representatives with respect to any Competing Transaction, or
(iv) enter into a letter of intent or other agreement with any Person other
than Buyer with respect to a Competing Transaction; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no such Competing Transaction shall relieve Seller (or
its successors or assigns) or its Affiliates of their obligations under this
Agreement. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause
the Transferred Entities and the respective Affiliates and Representatives of
Seller and the Transferred Entities to, immediately cease any existing
discussions and negotiations with any Person with respect to a Competing
Transaction other than the Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives (including by ceasing any access provided to any such Person,
or any Affiliates or Representatives of such Person, to any data room or other
records). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_, (x) " _Change
of Control_ " shall mean (A) any Person or group of Persons within the
meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more
of the outstanding common shares of Seller, or (B) individuals who constitute
the current directors of Seller ceasing for any reason to constitute at least
a majority of the board of directors of Seller and (y) " _Permitted
Transaction_ " shall mean (1) any transaction having as its object the Change
of Control of Seller or (2) in the ordinary course of business, sales of

be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary

in connection with the Acquisition have been obtained, Seller and Buyer shall
not, and shall cause each of the Seller and Buyer Corporations and their
respective Affiliates not to, operate their businesses in such manner or take

expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period.

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall (i) keep each other apprised of the status
of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Competition Authority, and shall comply

notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

to the other party as necessary to (x) comply with contractual arrangements,
or (y) address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns and (iv)
furnish to the other party such information and assistance as such party
reasonably may request in connection with the preparation of any submissions

cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist in any defense by any
other party to the Acquisition before any Governmental Competition Authority
reviewing the Acquisition, including by providing as promptly as practicable
such information as may be requested by such Governmental Competition
Authority or such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other party
to this Agreement in such defense.

 

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Competition Authority
with respect to the Acquisition under any applicable Competition Law or which
would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Acquisition, or if any Proceeding is instituted by any
Governmental Competition Authority or any private party challenging the
Acquisition as violative of applicable Competition Law, or an Order is issued
enjoining the Acquisition, each of Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve any such objections or Proceedings so as to permit
consummation of the Acquisition by the Closing as soon as practicable. In the
event that any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
Governmental Competition Authority or private party challenging the
Acquisition, each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in all respects with
each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such Proceeding, including defending through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and to have vacated,

extend, directly or indirectly, any such waiting period or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Competition Authority to delay or not to
consummate the Acquisition on the Closing Date, except with the prior written
consent of the other party to this Agreement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller and Buyer shall not have any
substantive contact with any Governmental Competition Authority in respect of
any filing or Proceeding contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Competition Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to
participate.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take any action necessary to avoid
and eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law,
so as to enable the consummation of the Acquisition as soon as practicable,

decree, hold separate order, mitigation agreement or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any required portion, product lines or assets
of the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Company Equity Interests or the
assets and properties of the Transferred Entities) and (ii) otherwise using
reasonable best efforts to take or commit to take actions that
after consummation of the Acquisition would limit INEOS Enterprises Group or
Transferred Entities freedom of action with respect to any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of INEOS Enterprises Group or the Transferred Entities
(including the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Company Equity Interests
or the assets and properties of the Transferred Entities).

Section 7.5  _Access Post-Closing_. Following the Closing, Buyer will permit

redacted portions thereof) of any Seller Affiliate (other than Excluded
Assets) that have not been transferred to Buyer and relate to the Business.
Each of Buyer and Seller will keep any information obtained under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ confidential other than with the consent of the other
party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 7.6 _Non-competition;  Non-solicitation_.

(a) Seller understands that Buyer shall be entitled to protect and
preserve the going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by

acquired from such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of
any such acquisition where the aggregate annual Operating Income related to
the Competitive Activity exceeds 25% of such aggregate annual Operating
Income, Seller shall be required to attempt to divest such excess portion of
the Competitive Activity at such price and on such terms as Seller deems
commercially reasonable. Seller shall not be required to divest such

applicable Asset Selling Corporation or the applicable Transferred Entity to
such Transferred Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date

bonus opportunities, under plans, programs and arrangements that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Seller, the applicable Asset

Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, the provision of plans, programs and arrangements
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Seller as

who accepts such offer of employment, (i) such Employee shall become a
Transferred Employee as of the date such Employee presents himself or herself
to Buyer or a Buyer Corporation for active employment, (ii) except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, all references in this Agreement to the Closing, the Closing
Date and the Effective Time shall instead be deemed to refer to the date such

Buyer Corporation shall have no obligation to provide compensation and
benefits to each such Employee until the date he or she becomes a Transferred
Employee.

Section 8.6 _Severance Obligations_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance
of employment of any Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
Acquisition and that the Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted
employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer Corporations to, comply with any
requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same. Buyer shall bear any
costs related to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Asset
Selling Corporations from and against, (i) any claims made by any Employee
for any statutory, contractual or common law severance or separation benefits
and other legally mandated payment obligations (including the employer portion
of any employment Taxes, together with any compensation payable during any
mandatory termination notice period related thereto), in each case, arising
out of or in connection with the failure of Buyer or the Buyer Corporations to
make offers of employment to, or continue the employment of, any Employee
in accordance with this Agreement and as required by applicable Law and (ii)
any claims relating to the employment of any Transferred Employee on or after
the Closing Date, including in respect of any act or omission relating to the
employment of any Transferred Employee on or after the Closing Date.

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Corporations to, provide each
Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated within eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date (or within such longer period as required by
applicable Law or pursuant to the

 



-65- 

    

 terms of any applicable Union Contract) with severance and other separation

benefits provided to such Transferred Employee by Seller, the applicable
Asset Selling Corporation or the applicable Transferred Entity as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.7 _Allocation of Employment Liabilities_.

 

(a) Except with respect to any Liabilities that transfer to Buyer or a Buyer

this Agreement or any Business Transfer Document, Seller and the Asset
Selling Corporations shall retain Liability and responsibility for all
employment and employee-benefit related Liabilities, claims or Losses that
arise as a result of an event or events that occurred prior to the Effective
Time that relate to the Employees (or any dependent or beneficiary of any
Employee). Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,
effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer or its Affiliates shall assume and
be solely responsible for all employment and employee-benefits related
Liabilities, claims or Losses that relate to (i) any current or former
employee of a Transferred Entity (or his or her dependent or beneficiary) that
arise as a result of an event or events that occurred on or after the
Effective Time, (ii) any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by a Transferred
Entity that arise as a result of an event or events that occurred on or after

expressly assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Seller and the Asset Selling Corporations shall retain all Liabilities for
all workers compensation, short- and long-term disability, medical,

the Effective Time that are covered under the terms of the applicable plans of
Seller and the Asset Selling Corporations or their respective Affiliates,
except that Buyer and the Buyer Corporations shall be responsible for such
claims to the extent such claims relate to a plan sponsored by a Transferred
Entity. With respect to claims incurred on or after the Effective Time by the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents for workers compensation,
short- and long-term disability, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision,
life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and other welfare benefit
claims, Buyer or its Affiliates shall be responsible. For these purposes, a
claim shall be deemed to be incurred: (i) in the case of short- or long-term
disability benefits (including related health benefits), at the time of the
injury, sickness or other event giving rise to the claim for such benefits,
(ii) in the case of workers compensation benefits, when the event giving rise
to the claim (" _Workers  Compensation Event_") occurs, (iii) in the case of
medical, prescription drug, dental or vision benefits, at the time
professional services, equipment or prescription drugs covered by the
applicable plan are obtained, (iv) in the case of life insurance benefits,
upon death and (v) in the case of accidental death and dismemberment benefits,
at the time of the accident. If the Workers Compensation Event occurs over a
period both preceding and following the Effective Time, the claim shall be
the joint Liability of Seller and the Asset Selling Corporations, on the one
hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Corporations, on the other hand, and shall be
equitably

 



-66- 

    

 apportioned between such parties based upon the relative periods of time
that the Workers Compensation Event transpired preceding and following the
Effective Time.

 

(c) _Schedule 8.7(c)_ sets forth all Employee Benefit Plans which are
sponsored or maintained by a Transferred Entity as of the Closing Date.

Section 8.8 _Service Credit_. Effective from and after the Effective Time,

Buyer, a Buyer Corporation or the applicable pension plan of Buyer or a Buyer
Corporation assumes Liability)) under all plans, programs and arrangements
established or maintained by Buyer or a Buyer Corporation for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees, service with Seller or the Asset Selling
Corporations and their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the
extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Employee Benefit
Plan covering such Transferred Employees and (ii) waive any pre-existing
condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all
employee health and other welfare benefit plans established or maintained by
Buyer or a Buyer Corporation for the benefit of the Transferred Employees,
except to the extent such pre-existing condition exclusion, requirement or
waiting period would have applied to such individual under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) to the
extent commercially feasible, provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Closing Date for
the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

Employee is entitled under applicable Law or any policy of Seller or any
Asset Selling Corporation to be paid for any paid time off (including
vacation, holiday, sick, or personal) accrued but not yet taken by the
Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date with respect to the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs or with respect to any prior calendar year
(the " _Accrued PTO Days_ "), Seller or any Asset Selling Corporation, shall
pay any required amounts to such Transferred Employee (any such amounts paid
by Seller or any Asset Selling Corporation, the " _Seller PTO Payment_ "). As
of the Effective Time, Buyer or a Buyer Corporation shall assume and honor all
the Accrued PTO Days for which payout is not made pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence (it being understood that Buyer or a Buyer Corporation may
deduct from the number of paid time off days made available to any such
Transferred Employee the number of days of paid time off previously taken by
such Transferred Employee in the applicable calendar year). Within sixty (60)
days following the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a schedule
setting forth the aggregate amount of the Seller PTO Payment. Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the aggregate amount of the Seller PTO Payment as soon
as administratively practicable but in any event no later than forty (40) days

notwithstanding the terms and conditions of such plans, shall pay to each
Transferred Employee that participates in any such plan an amount equal to the
amount such Transferred Employee would have been eligible to receive for the
applicable period in which the Closing Date occurs had such
Transferred Employee remained an employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries

applicable goals and conditions at target performance levels, as determined in
Sellers sole discretion, pro-rated based upon the period of time that

reasonable efforts to make the payments described in this  _Section_ __ _
8.10(a)_ within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date.
Following the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall participate in
annual incentive or short-term bonus plans sponsored or maintained by Buyer
or a Buyer Corporation.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller wishes for Buyer to make the
payments described in _Section_ __ _ 8.10(a)_ (in lieu of such payments
being made by Seller), then Seller shall provide Buyer with a schedule of such
payments to be made to the Transferred Employees (the " _Bonus Payment
Schedule_ "), and Buyer shall make such payments in accordance with the Bonus
Payment Schedule acting as agent on Sellers behalf. Following the date on
which all such payments have been made, Buyer shall provide Seller with a
schedule that sets forth the name and identification number of each
Transferred Employee who received a payment and the amount thereof (the "
_Paid Bonus Schedule_ "); _provided_ that all such names, identification
numbers and payment amounts must be in accordance with the Bonus Payment
Schedule. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the aggregate amount set forth on
the Paid Bonus Schedule as soon as administratively practicable but in any
event no later than forty (40) days following delivery of such schedule. If

her account balances (including earnings thereon through the date of transfer
and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) under Sellers 401(k)
Plan if such rollover to Buyers 401(k) Plan is elected in accordance with
applicable Law by such Transferred Employee, subject to each of Sellers or
the Asset Selling Corporations and Buyers reasonable satisfaction that
Sellers 401(k) Plan or Buyers 401(k) Plan, as applicable, is in compliance
with all applicable Laws and that such plan continues to satisfy the
requirements for a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and that
the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt from Tax under Section

or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or group termination or similar event
affecting Employees (including as a result of the Acquisition) and occurring
on and after the Effective Time. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall
take any action before or after the Closing that would cause any termination
of employment of any Employees that occurs before the Effective Time to
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group termination under
WARN, or to create any Liability or penalty to Seller, any Entity Selling
Corporations, or any Asset Selling Corporation for any employment terminations
under applicable Law. On the Closing Date, Seller shall notify Buyer of
any layoffs of any Employees working in the United States in the ninety (90)

any Selling Corporation to facilitate compliance by the Selling Corporations
with their obligations to inform and consult. Buyer or Buyers Affiliates

Liabilities for all accrued benefits thereunder, and Buyer, a Buyer
Corporation or the applicable pension plan of Buyer or a Buyer Corporation
shall assume all Liabilities for all accrued benefits under each
other Non-U.S. Seller Pension Plan, in each case, in accordance with
applicable Law or the terms of such plan (such Liabilities, the " _Transferred
Pension Liabilities_ "). Following any such transfer of the Transferred
Pension Liabilities, none of Seller or any Asset Selling Corporation shall
have any further Liability for any accrued benefits, or any other Liabilities,
under or with respect to any Transferred Non-U.S. Seller Pension Plan. If any

such Tax Return under applicable Law or (ii) by Seller if Buyer and its
Affiliates are not permitted to file such Tax Return under applicable Law;

permitted to file such Tax Return under applicable Law, in each case in
a timely manner consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required
by applicable Law or to correct any clear errors); _provided_ that such filing
party (x) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other party

shall consider in good faith any comments provided by such other party and (z)
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, file such Tax Return

party shall be deemed to have provided such consent unless it notifies such
filing party in writing, at least two (2) Business Days before the due date
for filing such tax Return of its objection to the filing of such Tax Return.

 

(e) (i) With respect to each Tax Return described in this _Section_ __ _
9.8_, the party required to file such Tax Return (or cause such Tax Return to
be filed) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ (the " _Tax Return Filer_ ")
shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority the amount, if any,
shown as due on such Tax Return; _provided_ that if the Tax Return Filer is
not permitted to make such payment under applicable Law, then the parties
shall cooperate in good faith to arrange for such amount to be paid to the
relevant Governmental Authority in a manner permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ _further_ that the obligation to make payments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.8(e)(i)_ shall not affect such Tax Return Filers right, if
any, to receive payments under  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(e)(ii)_ or otherwise be
indemnified under this Agreement with respect to any Taxes.

(ii) With respect to any Tax Return described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_

this  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(e)(ii)_; _provided_ that Seller shall not be
required to pay for any Holdback Taxes to Buyer unless and until the aggregate
amount of Holdback Taxes paid by Buyer exceeds the Estimated Holdback Tax
Amount held back pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

Section 9.9 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of any notice of any pending or
threatened Tax Contest relating to the Transferred Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, the Business, the Transferred Equity Interests or the
Transferred Entities for which Seller could be liable under _Section_ __ _
9.1_ if a claim for such Taxes were made (an " _Applicable Tax Contest_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no failure or delay by Buyer to provide notice
of an Applicable Tax Contest shall reduce or otherwise affect the
indemnification obligations of Seller hereunder except to the extent the
defense of such Applicable Tax Contest is actually prejudiced thereby.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.9(c)_, (i) Seller shall have the exclusive
right to control the conduct and settlement of all Applicable Tax Contests
relating to Taxes for which Seller could be solely liable under _Section_ __ _
9.1_ if a claim for such Taxes were made; _provided_ that Seller shall in no
event be liable for and therefore have no right to control the conduct and
settlement of any Applicable Tax Contest described in clause (ii)(A) below,
and (ii) Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control the conduct
and settlement of all Applicable Tax Contests (A) relating to any Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date with respect to the Transferred Assets, the

transferred Entities, or (B) relating to Taxes for which Buyer could be
solely liable under _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ if a claim for such Taxes were made.

shall pay to the other party the entire amount of such refund, credit or
offset (including any interest from, but net of any Taxes imposed by, a Taxing
Authority with respect to such refund, credit or offset) (i) in the case of a
refund, no more than thirty (30) Business Days after receiving such refund
and (ii) in the case of a credit or offset, no more than thirty (30) Business
Days after the filing of the Tax Return utilizing such credit or offset;

-75- 

    

 connection with Taxes (including interest, but net of any Taxes imposed with
respect to such refund, credit or offset) that relates to Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the principles of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_,
taking into account the type of Tax to which such refund, credit or offset
relates.

 

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, (i) make or change any Tax election of the
Transferred Entities or related to the Transferred Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Business for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period,
except to the extent permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(d)_, (ii) amend,

Date to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, without Sellers
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If Buyer or any of its Affiliates does carry back a
Tax Attribute to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then (x) no payment with respect
to such carryback shall be due to Buyer or any of its Affiliates from Seller
or any of its Affiliates and (y) if Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives
any refund, credit or offset of any Taxes in connection with such carryback,
Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the full amount of such refund or the

written consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (i) Buyer requests in
writing to make a 338(g) Election with respect to a Transferred Entity and

CIS 21 Limited, which is a Bermuda corporation and is a "controlled foreign
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code), as determined
immediately prior to the Closing, from (i) making distributions (whether
actual or deemed for Tax purposes) of cash or any other property to any of
such Transferred Entitys direct or indirect owners and (ii) taking any action
that would reasonably be expected to constitute an "investment in United
States property" (within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), in each case during such
Transferred Entitys U.S. federal income Tax period during which the Closing
occurs.

 

Section 9.11 _Like-Kind Exchange._

 

(a) If Seller notifies Buyer of its desire for the transfer of all or a
specified portion of the Transferred Real Property located in the United
States to qualify as a Like-Kind Exchange (the " _Like-Kind Assets_ ") and
Buyer consents in writing to such Like-Kind Exchange (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), then the parties shall (i)
cooperate in good faith to structure such transfer such that it qualifies, to
the greatest extent possible, as a Like-Kind Exchange and (ii) enter into such
other agreements, and make

 



-76- 

    

 such modifications to this Agreement, as are reasonably necessary to meet
the requirements of Section 1031 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder; _provided_ in each case that (x) none of the
representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations or other
agreements of the parties hereto shall be affected by such structuring and
modifications, (y) neither of the parties shall be required, in connection
with such structuring and modifications, to make any representations or
warranties, assume any Liabilities, acquire title to any property to which it
would not otherwise acquire title in connection with the Acquisition or,
in the case of Buyer, incur any unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, that the relevant party will not
otherwise make, assume, acquire or incur, but for this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_)
and (z) neither of the parties shall have any right to delay or postpone the
closing of such transfer for the principal purpose of facilitating such
transfers qualification as a Like-Kind Exchange.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ shall survive the Closing without limitation
and (ii) in the event of any conflict between this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and
the terms and conditions of any agreement entered into by the parties in
connection with the transfer of Like-Kind Assets, the terms and conditions of
such other agreement shall control to the extent of such conflict.

 

ARTICLE X

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.1 _Survival_. The Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing until the date that is six (6) years following the Closing Date and
then shall expire and be of no force or effect. All other representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement and the covenants contained in this
Agreement requiring performance prior to Closing shall survive the Closing
until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, and
shall then expire and be of no force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the representations and warranties contained in  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_
(Taxes) shall not survive the Closing for any purpose and thereafter shall
expire and be of no force and effect. The other covenants contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing Date in accordance with their terms or,
if no term is provided, twelve (12) months following the Closing Date and then
shall expire and be of no force or effect; _provided_ that (a) the covenants
set forth in _Sections 7.5_ , _7.7,_ _7.8_ and  _7.18_ shall survive for ten
(10) years following the Closing Date and then shall expire and be of no force
or effect, (b) the Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity and the Tax Covenants shall
survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations plus
thirty (30) days and then shall expire and be of no force or effect, and (c)
this _Article X_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely. To the extent that a
Claim for indemnification has been made pursuant to this _Article X_ prior to
the expiration of the applicable survival period pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 10.1_, then such representation and warranty or covenant, and the
related obligation to indemnify, shall survive for the purposes of such Claim
until fully and finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the limitations or exceptions set forth in
this _Article X_ , including any period of survival set forth herein, shall
in any way limit or modify the ability of the Buyer Indemnitees to make claims
under or recover under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

Section 10.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Agreement, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
directors, officers,

 



-77- 

    

 employees, Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities after the
Closing), agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_
") against and from any and all Losses which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur
or suffer at any time after the Closing to the extent such Losses arise out of
or result from (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by any
Selling Corporation in this Agreement, (b) the breach of any covenant or
agreement made by any Selling Corporation in this Agreement requiring
performance prior to Closing, (c) the breach of any other covenant or
agreement made by any Selling Corporation in this Agreement, (d) any of the
Excluded Liabilities, and (e) the Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding
that a Claim for Losses may fall into multiple categories of this _Section_ __
_ 10.2_, a Buyer Indemnitee may recover such Losses one time only. Buyer
shall, and shall cause the other Buyer Indemnitees to use reasonable best
efforts to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event that would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, and no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for that portion of such
Losses that is caused by the Buyer Indemnitees failure to comply with its
mitigation obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_.

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents
and Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and
from any and all Losses which any Seller Indemnitees may incur or suffer at
any time after the Closing to the extent such Losses arise out of or result
from (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or any
Buyer Corporation in this Agreement, (b) the breach of any covenant or
agreement made by Buyer or any Buyer Corporation in this Agreement requiring
performance prior to the Closing, (c) the breach of any other covenant or
agreement made by Buyer or any Buyer Corporation in this Agreement or (d) any
of the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding that a Claim for Losses may fall
into multiple categories of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, a Seller Indemnitee
may recover such Losses one time only. Seller shall, and shall cause the other
Seller Indemnitees to use reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Losses upon
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto.

 

Section 10.4 _Scope of Seller_ __ _s Liability_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
from and after the Closing, except for Claims arising from fraud or breaches
of the Fundamental Representations, the Retention and the RandW Insurance Policy
shall be the sole and exclusive source of funds for the satisfaction of all
Claims of the Buyer Indemnitees that are subject to indemnification under 
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ hereunder, and, from and after the Closing, recourse
to the Retention and the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies for the Buyer Indemnitees for breach of this Agreement with respect
to, or any Claim based in whole or in part on, or directly or indirectly
related to, any of Sellers representations and warranties (other than Claims
arising from fraud or breaches of the Fundamental Representations) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Indemnification shall be available to Buyer Indemnitees under  _Section_
__ _ 10.2(a)_ with respect to breaches of representations and warranties
(other than Claims arising from fraud or breaches of the Fundamental
Representations) only to the extent the aggregate amount of Losses
otherwise due to Buyer Indemnitees for all Claims for such indemnification
exceeds U.S.$ 4,125,000 (the " _Basket_ ") and then indemnification shall be
available to Buyer

 



-78- 

    

 Indemnitees from Seller for the amount of all payments due to Buyer
Indemnitees up to the Retention and thereafter the Buyer Indemnitees sole
recourse for the amount of all payments due to Buyer Indemnitees shall be the
RandW Insurance Policy. Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to indemnification
under _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties (other than Claims arising from fraud or breaches of the
Fundamental Representations) for any individual item where the Losses relating
thereto are less than U.S.$500,000 and such Losses shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the Basket has been reached.

 

(c) With respect to Claims arising from breaches of the Fundamental
Representations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ and the Pre-Closing Tax
Indemnity pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)_ and _10.2(e)_ , indemnification shall
be available to the Buyer Indemnitees from Seller for the amount of all
payments due to Buyer Indemnitees up to the entire amount of the retention
due under the RandW Insurance Policy, then indemnification shall be available to
the Buyer Indemnities from the RandW Insurance Policy, to the extent coverage is
available thereunder, and then indemnification shall be available to the
Buyer Indemnities from Seller; _provided_ that Seller shall only be liable for
Losses, other than the amount of the retention due under the RandW Insurance
Policy, in excess of the total amounts paid to Buyer under the RandW Insurance
Policy with respect to such Claims. Notwithstanding anything else in this
_Article X_ , Sellers maximum Liability with respect to indemnification of
the Buyer Indemnitees (i) for breaches of the Fundamental Representations
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_, and the Pre-Closing Tax Indemnity
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 10.2(e)_ shall be an
amount equal to the amount of the Purchase Price actually received by Seller
(together with its designated Affiliates pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_)
_minus_ the amounts paid to Buyer pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy and
(ii) for breaches of covenants or agreements pursuant to _Sections 10.2(b) and
(c)_ shall be an amount equal to the amount of the Purchase Price actually
received by Seller (together with its designated Affiliates pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_).

(d) Prior to pursuing any Claim against Seller (other than for the amount of
the retention due under the RandW Insurance Policy) arising from breaches of the
Fundamental Representations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ and the Pre-
Closing Tax Indemnity pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)_ and _10.2(e)_ , Buyer
shall, on behalf of itself and all other applicable Buyer Indemnitees, use
reasonable best efforts to recover any such Losses which may be available
with respect to the fact or matter underlying such Claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy before making any Claim against Seller hereunder.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
10.4_, none of the limitations set forth in  _Sections 10.4(a)_ through
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(d)_ shall apply with respect to Losses (and such Losses
shall not be taken into account in determining the Basket or any cap) (i) in
respect of any of the Excluded Liabilities and Sellers responsibility
therefor or (ii) in respect of any claim for fraud or injunctive or
provisional relief (including specific performance).

 

(f) In no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee
with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in
the calculation of the adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to
_Sections 2.3_ or _2.4_.

 



-79- 

    

(g) For purposes of determining the amount of any Loss in respect of the
failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any
particular date, any standard or qualification as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" in such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded.

 

Section 10.5 _Claims_. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this  _Article_ __ _ X_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the other party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of each matter, action, cause of action, claim,
demand, fact or other circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a
" _Claim_ ") hereunder may be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect
to each Claim, such facts and information as are then reasonably available,
including the estimated amount of Losses and the specific basis for
indemnification hereunder. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder
shall not affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

Section 10.6 _Defense of Actions_. The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys option and expense, to assume
the complete defense of any Claim based on any action, suit, Proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment by any third party with full authority to conduct
such defense and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the
Indemnified Party will fully cooperate in such defense; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such action, suit, Proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
consent to the entry of any Order or enter into any settlement (a) which
provides for any relief other than the payment of monetary damages and/or (b)
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
third party claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from all Liability
in respect thereof. After notice to the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying Partys election to assume the defense of such action, suit,
Proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to the Indemnified Party only for such legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof at the written request of the Indemnifying Party. As to those third
party actions, suits, Proceedings, claims, demands or assessments with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the
defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the Indemnifying Party an
opportunity to participate in such defense, at its cost and expense, and will
consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or otherwise disposing
of any of the same. The Indemnified Party will not settle any Claim without
the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The election of the
Indemnifying Party to assume the defense or prosecution of a Claim will not
be deemed an admission by the Indemnifying Party that the claims made in the
Claim are within the scope of or subject to indemnification under this
Agreement. The parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
third party Claim, with such cooperation to include (x) the retention and,
upon the Indemnifying Partys request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party
of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such third
party Claim, and (y) the making available of employees on a mutually
convenient basis for providing additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. This _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ shall not apply to
any Applicable Tax Contest, which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.

 



-80- 

    

Section 10.7 _Limitation, Exclusivity_.

 

(a) No Claim with respect to a representation, warranty or covenant shall be
made or have any validity unless the Indemnified Party shall have given
written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the date set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ for such representation, warranty or covenant
to expire. Other than (i) any dispute under  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ that is
required to be decided by the Accounting Firm, (ii) any dispute under
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ that is required to be decided by the Actuary, (iii) as
expressly provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ regarding fraud and
injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance) if the
Closing occurs (iv) as expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, and (v)
pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy, this _Article_ __ _ X_ provides the
exclusive means by which a party may assert and remedy any and all Claims, and
_Section_ __ _ 12.11_ provides the exclusive means by which a party may
bring actions, in each case, against the other party (or any of its
Affiliates) under or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein. Except for injunctive and provisional relief
(including specific performance) if the Closing occurs and except as
expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, each party hereby waives and
releases any other remedies or claims that it may have against the other party
(or any of its Affiliates) with respect to the matters arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or
therein or relating to the Transferred Assets, the Excluded Assets, the
Transferred Equity Interests, the Transferred Entities, the Assumed
Liabilities and the Excluded Liabilities (including, _inter_ _alia_ , any
rights of contribution or recovery under CERCLA or other Environmental Law)
except that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Liability of any party
hereto for fraud. With respect to any Losses or other Liabilities arising
under this Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall only seek such Losses and
Liabilities from Seller, and Buyer hereby waives the right to seek Losses or
other Liabilities from or equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief,
against any Affiliate of Seller or any director, officer or employee of Seller
(or any of its Affiliates). If an Indemnified Party is indemnified for any
Losses pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any Claim by a third party
(other than the RandW Policy), then the appropriate Indemnifying Party will be
subrogated to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party against such
third party, and such Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with
and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all such rights and remedies
against such third party.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision herein,

(i) Seller shall have no Liability for any Loss under _Section_ __ _ 10.2_
relating to breach of the representations and warranties in _Section_ __ _
5.14_ or _5.16_ or otherwise with respect to any Environmental Liability
(collectively, any " _Environmental Loss_ ") if the cost, obligation, event,
circumstance or condition that gave rise to such Environmental Loss (A) is
the result of any sampling, testing or investigation conducted after the
Closing Date, except to the extent any such sampling, testing or investigation
was required by Environmental Law or required to respond to an unsolicited
inquiry, request, claim, Order, or demand by a Governmental Authority or if
reasonably necessary to assess environmental, health or safety concerns
evident from circumstances arising during the ordinary course of repair,
maintenance or operation of the Business; (B) is the result of a change in use
of any Business Real Property after the Closing; (C) arises out of or results
from a change in any Environmental Law after the Closing Date; (D) to the
extent the cost of such Environmental Loss is increased due to an act or
omission by Buyer Indemnitee, its Affiliates, agents, contractors or
subcontractors; (E) results

 



-81- 

    

 from any failure to minimize costs and risks in a lowest cost commercially
reasonable manner that is allowed under applicable Environmental Law; (F)
relates to the removal or abatement of asbestos or asbestos-containing
materials or lead-based paint located on or in structural components of the
Business Real Property, the Transferred Tangible Personal Property or the
tangible personal property of any Transferred Entity; or (G) is compensable
by any third party (including insurance companies).

(ii) Seller shall direct and control all discussions, negotiations and
Proceedings with or before Governmental Authorities or third parties with
respect to any Environmental Loss that is subject to indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_, including the right, after notice to and consultation
with Buyer, to settle or otherwise resolve any matter giving rise to or
forming part of such Environmental Loss, including the placement of
engineering or institutional controls, such as use or deed restrictions;
_provided_ that Seller may not enter into any such settlement or resolution,
including any use or deed restriction, that would materially adversely affect
Buyers operation of the Business or the subject property as existing on the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent will
not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. Buyer may, at its cost
and expense, participate in all discussions, negotiations or Proceedings with
or before Governmental Authorities or third parties with respect to any such
Environmental Loss. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Buyer hereby
grants to Seller and its consultants an irrevocable and fully paid-up license
to enter upon, access and use the Business Real Property, the Transferred
Tangible Personal Property and the tangible personal property of any
Transferred Entity in order to meet its obligations with respect to any
Environmental Loss that is subject to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
10.2_; _provided_ that, Seller shall conduct any assessment, remediation,
response, removal, corrective or monitoring activities in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations or conduct of the
Business, unless mandated to do so by a Governmental Authority.

Section 10.8 _Calculation of Damages_.

 

(a) Each Indemnified Party and Indemnified Tax Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all insurance proceeds (including proceeds under the
RandW Insurance Policy) or other payments from third parties. The amount of Loss
for which each Indemnified Party may be entitled to seek indemnification under
this Agreement, and the amount of Taxes for which each Indemnified Tax
Party may be entitled to seek indemnification under this Agreement, will be
reduced by the amount of (x) any insurance proceeds (including proceeds under
the RandW Insurance Policy), or other payment from a third party actually
received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates (or by the Indemnified Tax Party or any of its Affiliates) with
respect to such Loss (or Taxes), less the amount of any expenses incurred by
it in procuring such recovery and (y) any net Tax benefit arising from the
incurrence or payment of such Loss (or Taxes) actually realized by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (or by the Indemnified Tax Party or
any of its Affiliates) during the Post-Closing Tax Period prior to the
incurrence or payment of such Loss (or Taxes), or the year of such incurrence
or payment of such Loss (or Taxes). In computing the amount of any such Tax
benefit, (i) each Indemnified Party and Indemnified Tax Party shall be deemed
to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified Loss or indemnified Taxes and (ii) an Indemnified Party or an
Indemnified Tax Party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax
benefit

 



-82- 

    

 to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of cash Taxes payable by
such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Tax Party is actually reduced below the
amount of cash Taxes that such Indemnified Party would be required to pay but
for the incurrence or payment of such Loss (or Taxes), in each case, as
determined by the Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Tax Party in good
faith.

 

(b) If the Indemnified Party, after having received any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a Loss,
subsequently receives or realizes any insurance proceeds (including proceeds
under the RandW Insurance Policy), or other payment, such Person will promptly
refund and pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such insurance
proceeds (including proceeds under the RandW Insurance Policy), or payment
(after deducting therefrom the amount of any expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery, to the extent such Indemnified Party did not already
receive payment for such expenses from the Indemnifying Party), but not in
excess of any amount previously paid by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

 

Section 10.9 _Apportionment of Damages_. In the event that a Loss is caused in
part by circumstances that would give rise to the Sellers obligation to
indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ and in part by circumstances that would
give rise to the Buyers obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 10.3_,
the parties shall indemnify each other in proportion to their respective
shares of responsibility. In such an instance the party with the largest share
of responsibility shall be treated as the Indemnifying Party for the purposes
of  _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, with the costs of defense being shared
proportionately.

ARTICLE XI

Seller, (ii) forty-five (45) days have elapsed since the receipt by Buyer of a
written notice from Seller of such incapability and (iii) within such forty-
five (45) day period such condition shall not have become capable of

(c) by Buyer if (i) any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.2_
shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived by

-83- 

    

(d) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred (other than
through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before September
10, 2019, or such later date as the parties may agree upon in writing.

 

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, all obligations of the parties under this Agreement
will terminate and it will become void and of no further force or effect,

with respect to confidentiality, _11.2_ ,  _12.7_ , _12.8_ , _12.9_ , _12.10_
and _12.11_ will survive; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is
terminated by a party because of the breach of this Agreement by another party
of any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, or
because one or more of the conditions to the terminating partys obligations
under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other partys failure
to comply with its covenant or obligations contained in this Agreement, then
the terminating partys right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_
shall be deemed to release any party from any Liability for any breach by
such party of the terms, conditions, covenants and other provisions of this
Agreement.

Section 12.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller or, in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.

 

Section 12.3 _Assignment_. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, including by sale of stock or by
operation of Law in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all
assets, without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except

the Transferred Assets and the Transferred Company Equity Interests and
assume the Assumed Liabilities to one or more of its controlled Affiliates,
and Seller may assign the Asset Selling Corporations and the Entity Selling

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Letter, Annexes and Exhibits), the Ancillary Agreements and the Affiliate
Guarantee comprise the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect for the
term provided for therein and any other written agreement of the parties that
expressly provides that it is not superseded by this Agreement.

 



-85- 

    

Section 12.5 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to
any other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed,
satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 

Section 12.6 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, Seller or their successors or
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement.

Section 12.7 _Public Disclosure_. No communication, release or announcement to
the public or to employees or others not directly involved in the negotiation
or approval of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Acquisition
shall be issued or made by any party without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as such communication, release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any U.S. or foreign securities
exchange or similar organization, in which case the party required to make
the communication, release or announcement shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment thereon in advance of such issuance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each of the parties may make internal announcements to their
respective employees that are consistent with the parties prior public
disclosures regarding the Acquisition after reasonable prior notice to and
consultation with the other parties.

 

Section 12.8 _Return of Information_. If for any reason whatsoever the
Acquisition is not consummated, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller all

the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 12.9 _Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including this
_Section_ __ _ 12.9_, each of the parties hereto shall be responsible for the
payment of its or any of its Affiliates own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiations leading up to and the performance of its own

(b) The filing fees required by any Governmental Competition Authority shall
be borne by Buyer.

 

Section 12.10 _Schedules_.

 

(a) The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to this Agreement shall
expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by any
Selling Corporation, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material
for the purposes of this Agreement. Disclosure of any matter, fact, or
circumstance in any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to be
disclosure thereof for purposes of any other Schedule.

 



-86- 

    

(b) From time to time before the Closing, Seller may (but is not required to)
supplement or amend any Schedule with respect to any matter arising or of
which it becomes aware after the date of this Agreement (each a " _Schedule
Supplement_ "). Any disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement shall not be
deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the
indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in  _Article IV_ have
been satisfied.

Section 12.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and any and all
matters, disputes, or claims between the parties arising out of, relating to,
or in accordance with its subject matter or formation (including any
contractual disputes or claims), and whether purporting to be found in
contract or tort or at law or in equity, shall be governed by, enforced, and
construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
U.S.A., without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware, U.S.A. or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware, U.S.A. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court does not
have jurisdiction, any Delaware state court or United States Federal Court
sitting in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof,
for the purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and
each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect
of such Proceeding may be heard in such state court or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, in such Federal court. Each party agrees to
commence any such Proceeding either in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if
such Proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons,
in any Delaware state court or United States Federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware (and any appellate courts thereof). Each of Seller and
Buyer further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document
by U.S. registered mail to such partys address set forth above shall be
effective service of process for any action, suit or Proceeding in Delaware
with respect to any matters to which such party has submitted to jurisdiction
in this _Section_ __ _ 12.11_. Each of Seller and Buyer irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of Proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the Acquisition,
in any court referred to in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 12.11_
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

Section 12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile, e-mail or
other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 12.13 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the Table of
Contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of
this Agreement, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

 

Section 12.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or

 



-87- 

    

 enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof in any other jurisdiction.

Section 12.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE
ALL ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL ACTIONS THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND
THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT
CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW
AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 12.15_.

Section 12.16 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law if any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with its terms or was otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including
in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific
performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable relief shall be in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law
or in equity as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or threatened breach.

(b) Each party agrees to (i) cooperate fully in any attempt by the other
party in obtaining any such equitable remedy and (ii) waive any requirement
for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable
remedy. Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it
may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests
the existence of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this
Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative (and
not alternative).

 



-88- 

    

Section 12.17 _Legal Representation_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Entities),
acknowledges and agrees that Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP (" _SPB_ ") may have
acted as counsel for Seller or its Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Transferred Entities) in certain matters and that Seller
reasonably anticipates that SPB will continue to represent them and/or such
other parties (other than the Transferred Entities) in future matters.
Accordingly, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Transferred Entities), expressly: (a) consents to SPBs
representation of Seller and its Affiliates in any post-Closing matter in
which the interests of Buyer and the Transferred Entities, on the one hand,
and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including, any
matter relating thereto; and (b) consents to the disclosure by SPB to Seller
or its Affiliates of any information learned by SPB in the course of
its representation of Seller, the Transferred Entities or their respective
Affiliates. Furthermore, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Entities), irrevocably waives
any right it may have to discover or obtain information or documentation
relating to the representation of Seller or its Affiliates by SPB in the
Acquisition, to the extent that such information or documentation was
privileged as to Seller or its Affiliates. Upon and after the Closing, the
Transferred Entities shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with
SPB, unless and to the extent SPB is specifically engaged in writing by any
Transferred Entity to represent such Person after the Closing and
such engagement either (i) involves no conflict of interest with respect to
Seller or its Affiliates or (ii) Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable,
consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation by
SPB after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.
