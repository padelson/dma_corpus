Notwithstanding the foregoing, those assets located within the geographic area
of the Seller Exchanges, but primarily used or held for use by Seller in an area
other than the Seller Exchanges shall not be Acquired Assets.

                2.1.2   Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 2.1.1 or in any other provision of this Agreement, the
Acquired Assets shall not include any of the following assets, properties and

consideration for the payment by Buyer to Seller at the Closing of the Purchase
Price calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1 and the
assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.

     2.3       Assumption of Liabilities.

                2.3.1   Assumed Liabilities. Upon the terms and subject to

Exchanges arising out of any Law of any Governmental Authority after the Closing
Date regardless of whether the action taken by the Governmental Authority is or
purports to be based on conduct or actions that occurred at any time prior to
the Closing Date ("Future Regulatory Obligations"); provided, however, Buyer
shall not be liable for any Future Regulatory Obligation arising directly out of
any (i) willful misconduct by Seller as judicially determined by a final order
of a court or Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) conduct
by Seller that was not reasonably prudent based on then-prevailing
circumstances, in either case which conduct occurred prior to the Closing Date
("Retained Future Regulatory Obligations"); and provided further, that Seller's
reliance on a reasonable interpretation of existing Law or practice shall be
deemed reasonably prudent;

                        (h)   all liabilities, responsibilities and obligations
related to the Seller Exchanges arising out of any Law of any Governmental
Authority requiring any capital expenditure after the date of this Agreement,
regardless of whether the action taken by the Governmental Authority is or
purports to be based on conduct, facts or actions that occurred at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement ("Interim Capital Expenditure Obligations");
provided, however, Buyer shall not be liable for any Interim Capital Expenditure
Obligation arising directly out of any (i) willful misconduct by Seller as
judicially determined by a final order of a court or Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, or (ii) conduct by Seller that was not reasonably
prudent based on then-prevailing circumstances, ("Retained Interim Capital
Expenditure Obligations"); and, provided further, that Seller's reliance on a
reasonable interpretation of existing Law or practice shall be deemed reasonably
prudent. Seller shall notify Buyer of all material Interim Capital Expenditure
Obligations within a reasonable time after publication of said obligations by a
Governmental Authority; and

                        (i)   all liabilities and obligations for litigation
and claims by third parties arising out of an occurrence after the Closing Date,
including any claims for infringement of Third Party Intellectual Property for
acts occurring after the Closing Date;

(collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"). Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 2.3.1 to the contrary, Assumed Liabilities shall not include any
liabilities, responsibilities or obligations expressly included in Retained
Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.3.2.

                2.3.2   Retained Liabilities. Seller shall retain and shall pay,
perform and discharge when due, the following liabilities, responsibilities and
obligations of Seller (the "Retained Liabilities"):

                        (a)   subject to the provisions of Section 10.4 or as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, all trade payables and other payment
obligations of Seller that relate to the operation of the Business on or prior
to the Closing Date;

                        (b)   all long-term debt of Seller (including
indebtedness to the Lienholders) and debt of Seller owed to any one or more of
its Affiliates, but excluding liabilities assumed pursuant to Article VIII
hereof;

                        (c)   subject to the provisions of Sections 10.4 and

Business or the use, ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets for all Tax
periods (or portions thereof), ending on or prior to the Closing Date;

                        (d)   except to the extent otherwise provided in
Article VIII, all liabilities and obligations arising on or prior to the Closing
Date with respect to employees who, upon Closing, will be Transferred Employees,
including (i) all liabilities, responsibilities and obligations relating to
collective bargaining agreements or other union contracts, and (ii) any such
liabilities or obligations that arise on or after the Closing Date to the extent
that such liabilities and obligations relate to facts, circumstances or
conditions arising or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, but excluding
any Future Regulatory Obligations with respect to the Transferred Employees;

                        (e)   all liabilities, responsibilities and obligations
for litigation and claims of third parties arising out of an occurrence on or
prior to the Closing Date, other than litigation and claims related to Future
Regulatory Obligations and Interim Capital Expenditure Obligations (except
Retained Future Regulatory Obligations and Retained Interim Capital Expenditure
Obligations which shall remain the liability of Seller); provided, however,
Seller shall have no liability for claims by third parties which have not been
asserted within five (5) years after the Closing Date; and

                        (f)   all liabilities, responsibilities and obligations
with respect to the Excluded Assets and Excluded Contracts.

     2.4        Regarding Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment or delivery or attempted sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or
delivery to Buyer of any Acquired Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers (other than authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers
related to Third Party Intellectual Property, and other than required Regulatory
Approvals and FCC Consents) (collectively, the "Third Party Consents") and such
Third Party Consents shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign same if any of the
foregoing would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful. If any Third Party
Consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would be
ineffective or would impair Buyer's rights under the Acquired Asset in question
so that Buyer would not acquire the benefit of all such rights, Seller, to the
extent permitted by Law, shall act after the Closing as Buyer's agent in order
to preserve and obtain for Buyer the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to
the extent permitted by Law, with Buyer in any other commercially reasonable
arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer. For a period of ninety
(90) days following the Closing, the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such
Third Party Consents; provided, however, that should any Third Party Consent
from any railroad be conditioned on the payment of any consideration therefor
(the "Consent Fees") other than filing, recordation or similar fees payable to
any Governmental Authority, which filing fees shall be shared equally by Seller
and Buyer, Seller and Buyer agree to share on an equal basis any Consent Fee to
the extent such Consent Fee is in an amount not greater than $300; and provided,
further, that Seller's aggregate obligation to share in the payment of Consent
Fees shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00).

     2.5        The Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been earlier
terminated in accordance with the provisions of Article XI, the closing under
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall be held at 9:00 A.M. local time at the
offices of Verizon Services Group, at 600 Hidden Ridge, Irving, Texas 75038, on
the date agreed upon by the parties, which date shall be (a) the last Business
Day of a month, and (b) at least five (5) Business Days, but not more than
ninety (90) days, after the date either party notifies the other party in
writing of its determination that all required Regulatory Approvals, Debtholder
Consents and FCC Consents (collectively, the "Closing Consents") have been
obtained, or at such other time and place as the parties may agree in writing;
provided, however, the parties shall take all commercially reasonable actions to
cause the Closing to occur promptly after all Closing Consents have been
obtained, but in no event shall the Closing be required to occur (i) prior to
June 30, 2002 or (ii) on the same date as the closing of any other transaction
involving the sale or purchase of wireline assets between Affiliates of the
parties hereto. The date of the Closing is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date." Such Closing shall be deemed to have occurred as of 11:59 P.M. on the
Closing Date.

     2.6        Deliveries and Proceedings at Closing. At the Closing, and
subject to the terms and conditions herein contained:

                2.6.1   Deliveries by Seller. Seller shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to Buyer:

                        a)    subject to Permitted Encumbrances, deeds in
recordable form under which Seller warrants title against all persons lawfully

Property to be conveyed hereunder, duly executed by Seller;

                        (b)   the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, License Agreement and Publishing Agreement, duly executed by Seller
(or the appropriate Seller Affiliate);

                        (c)  such other instruments and documents of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, duly executed by Seller and in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as shall be necessary and effective to
transfer, convey and assign to Buyer all of Seller's right, title and interest
in and to the Acquired Assets, including without limitation, all of Seller's
rights under all Assigned Contracts, in all cases subject to Section 2.4 above;

                        (d)   to the extent obtained, the Seller Consents in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; and

                        (e)   such other documents as Buyer may reasonably
request.

                2.6.2   Deliveries by Buyer. Buyer shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to Seller:

                        (a)   the Closing Date Payment in accordance with the

                        (b)   the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, License Agreement and Publishing Agreement, duly executed by Buyer;
and

                        (c)   such other documents as Seller may reasonably
request.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                 PURCHASE PRICE

     3.1        Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Acquired Assets shall
be the sum of (a) One Billion One Hundred Fifty Nine Million Four Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,159,400,000) (the "Base Purchase Price"), plus (b) amounts
expended by Seller to comply with Interim Capital Expenditure Obligations (the
"Regulatory Obligation Amount"), plus (c) the Non-Regulated Construction Work in
Process Amount minus (d) any Capital Expenditure Deficiency (collectively, the
"Purchase Price").

     3.2        Closing Date Estimate. Not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a notice, setting forth
Seller's good faith estimate as of the Closing Date of (a) the Regulatory
Obligation Amount (the "Estimated Regulatory Obligation Amount"), (b) the
Non-Regulated Construction Work in Process Amount (the "Estimated Non-Regulated
Construction Work in Process Amount") and (c) any Capital Expenditure
Deficiency. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the sum of (x) the Base Purchase Price, (y) the Estimated Regulatory Obligation
Amount, and (z) the Estimated Non-Regulated Construction Work in Process Amount,
less the Deposit and any Capital Expenditure Deficiency (the "Closing Date
Payment"). The Closing Date Payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts as Seller shall
designate to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
Payments from Buyer to Seller for CBSS and SSB Accounts Receivable and from
Seller to Buyer for Customer Prepayments and Customer Deposits will occur
subsequent to Closing in accordance with Article X.

     3.3        Calculation of Final Purchase Price.

                3.3.1   Closing Date Statement. Within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a written statement
reasonably detailing the Regulatory Obligation Amount, the Non-Regulated
Construction Work in Process Amount and any Capital Expenditure Deficiency,
together with supporting documentation (the "Closing Date Statement"). Absent
manifest error, the Closing Date Statement shall be deemed correct. Within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Date Statement, Buyer shall, in a
written notice to Seller, describe in reasonable detail any proposed adjustments
to the Closing Date Statement and the reasons therefor. If Seller shall not have
received a notice of proposed adjustments aggregating Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000) or more within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer will be deemed to
have accepted irrevocably such Closing Date Statement.

                3.3.2   Disputes Regarding Closing Date Statement. Seller and
Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes over any proposed
adjustments to the Closing Date Statement, during the thirty (30) days following
Seller's receipt of the proposed adjustments. If the parties are unable to
resolve such dispute within such thirty (30) day period, then, at the written
request of either party (the "Dispute Resolution Request"), each party shall
appoint a knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet in person and
negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed matters. The parties intend that
these negotiations be conducted by experienced business representatives
empowered to decide the issues. Such negotiations shall take place during the
fifteen (15) day period following the date of the Dispute Resolution Request. If
the business representatives resolve the dispute, such resolution shall be
memorialized in a written agreement (the "Final Closing Date Statement"),
executed within five (5) Business Days thereafter. If the business
representatives do not resolve the dispute, within five (5) Business Days Buyer
and Seller shall jointly select a nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm (which is not the regular independent public accounting firm of
either party) to resolve such disputes, which resolution shall be final and
binding. Such accounting firm shall resolve such dispute by reference to the
records of Seller used to calculate the amounts appearing on the Closing Date
Statement, the provisions contained herein regarding items properly included in
the Regulatory Obligation Amount and the Non-Regulated Construction Work in
Process Amount and, based on the foregoing, such other records as such firm, in
its reasonable judgment, deems appropriate. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be (a) shared by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion to
the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined to be for the account of
Buyer and Seller, respectively or (b) paid by the Buyer if the final amount of
any adjustment is less than $50,000.

                3.3.3   Final Determination of Purchase Price. Upon the
acceptance of the Closing Date Statement by Buyer, or upon resolution of any
disputed amount in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3.2 above, the
parties shall, based thereupon, calculate the final Purchase Price. If the
Purchase Price as finally determined is greater than the Closing Date Payment,
Buyer shall promptly, but no later than three (3) Business Days after such
acceptance or resolution, pay to Seller the amount of such difference. If the
Purchase Price as determined above is less than the Closing Date Payment, Seller
shall promptly, but no later than three (3) Business Days after such acceptance
or resolution, pay to Buyer the amount of such difference.

                3.3.4   Interest on Final Payment. Any amount paid pursuant
to this Section 3.3 after the Closing Date shall bear interest from the Closing
Date through but excluding the date of payment, at the Applicable Rate. Such
interest shall accrue daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five
(365) days calculated for the actual number of days for which due and shall be
payable together with the amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.3.

                3.3.5   Payments. All amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 3.3 shall, in the case of amounts payable to Seller, be paid in
accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 3.2 above and, in the case
of amounts payable to Buyer, to such account of Buyer as Buyer shall designate
in writing to Seller.

     3.4        Performance Deposit.

                3.4.1   Deposit. Concurrent with the execution and delivery
hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 3.4.2 below, Buyer shall pay to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds the sum of One Hundred
Fifteen Million Dollars ($115,000,000), which amount shall bear interest from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article XI at the Applicable Rate
(the "Deposit"). Such Deposit shall be held by Seller against payment of the
Purchase Price and as security for the performance by Buyer of its obligations
under this Agreement, and shall be nonrefundable except as described in Section
11.3.

                3.4.2   Letter of Credit. Buyer may elect to deliver the
Deposit to Seller in cash or in the form of an irrevocable, standby letter of
credit for the same amount (the "Deposit L/C"). The Deposit L/C shall be (a) in
a form reasonably acceptable to Seller, (b) issued in favor of Seller under this
Agreement and (c) issued by a bank that has a long-term unsecured debt rating as
of the date of issuance of at least A+ by Standard & Poor's Rating Information
Services and A1 by Moody's Investors Service and that is otherwise reasonably
satisfactory to Seller. The Deposit L/C (and any replacement thereof furnished
in accordance with this Section 3.4.2) shall have an expiration date no earlier
than the first anniversary of the date of issuance thereof and shall be
automatically renewed from year to year unless stated not to be so renewed by
the issuer thereof in a written notice given to the Seller not less than 30 days
prior to the expiration thereof. In the event of the termination of the Deposit
L/C (and any replacement thereof furnished in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3.4.2), Buyer shall deliver to Seller a replacement letter or
letters of credit in lieu thereof no later than 30 days prior to the expiration
of the preceding letter of credit. If Buyer shall fail to obtain any replacement
of the Deposit L/C (and/or any replacement thereof furnished in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 3.4.2), then Seller shall draw down the full
amount of the existing Deposit L/C and retain the same as security for the
covenants, agreements and obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. Any
replacement of any Deposit L/C shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Seller. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has agreed to accept the Deposit L/C in
lieu of a cash down payment against the Purchase Price solely as an
accommodation to Buyer. Buyer acknowledges that, in the event Buyer elects to
provide a Deposit L/C in lieu of a cash Deposit, Buyer shall not be entitled to
interest at the Applicable Rate as provided in Section 3.4.1 of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     4.1        Representations and Warranties of Seller. Seller represents and
warrants to Buyer as follows:

                4.1.1   Corporate Organization and Related Matters. Seller is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Seller has the requisite power
and authority to own its properties and to carry on the Business as it is now
being conducted. Seller holds valid permits, licenses, franchises, approvals and
authorizations issued or granted by any Governmental Authority and adequate for
the operation of the Business as currently conducted, except to the extent
absence of any such permit, license, franchise, approval or authorization would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has the requisite power, authority
and legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents executed or to be executed
by Seller have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Seller and Verizon. This Agreement has been, and the Ancillary Documents
when executed will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller and any applicable
Seller Affiliate and this Agreement constitutes, and the Ancillary Documents
when executed and delivered will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Seller (or its Affiliate named therein), enforceable against it
(or such Seller Affiliate) in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy laws and other similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject to the exercise of judicial
discretion in accordance with principles of equity.

                4.1.2   Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth in Schedule
4.1.2, Seller in its conduct of the Business has complied since January 1, 1997
in all material respects with, and is currently not in violation of, any
Requirement of Law of a Governmental Authority to which the Business is subject,
except for any such noncompliance or violation which would not be reasonably
likely to constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

                4.1.3   Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1.3,
there is no litigation, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding of or
before any Governmental Authority pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened against the Seller, the Business or any of the Acquired Assets, the
result of which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or impair the
ability of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller is
not a party to nor is it or the Business subject to the provisions of any
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Authority
which would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                4.1.4   Validity of Contemplated Transactions. Upon the
receipt of requisite FCC Consents as described in Section 5.3.2, the Regulatory
Approvals as described in Section 5.3.1, compliance with any applicable
requirement of the HSR Act and the receipt of the consents set forth on Schedule
4.1.4 (the "Seller Consents"), the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by Seller do not and will not violate,
conflict with, result in the creation of a Lien under or result in the breach of
any term, condition or provision of, or require the consent of any other Person
under, (a) the charter and other organizational documents of Seller, (b) any
existing Requirement of Law to which Seller or the Business is subject, (c) any
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Authority
or any other Governmental Order or Law which is applicable to the Business, or
(d) except as provided expressly in any Material Contract, any Material
Contract, or give any party with rights thereunder the right to terminate,
modify, accelerate or otherwise change the existing rights or obligations of
Seller thereunder.

                4.1.5   Title to Owned Real Property.

                        (a)   Seller has good, valid and marketable title to
all of the material Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Encumbrances and Liens of the Lienholders identified on Schedule
4.1.5(a). Seller represents that the only lienholders (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) on any of the Owned Real Property are the Lienholders identified
on Schedule 4.1.5(a) except as would not reasonably be likely to be materially

operation of the Business as it is currently conducted;

Affiliates, as applicable, against any other party thereto in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be limited by

Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law), and except for any such failure to be valid, binding, in full force and
effect or enforceable that is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1.9(b), neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates that is a party to a Material Contract is, and to the Knowledge of
Seller, no other party thereto is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any material obligation, covenant or condition contained in the

that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, except as disclosed on Schedule
4.1.9(b), neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates have received any written
notice of the intention of any party to terminate any Material Contract.

3(37) of ERISA, and with respect to any such multiemployer plans (as so defined)
listed in Schedule 4.1.13(d), Seller has not made or incurred, and the

statements for the Business for the years ended December 31, 1998, December 31,

data for the Business for the six month period ended June 30, 2001 (the "June 30

and, to the Knowledge of Seller, is a materially accurate reflection of the
items presented for the time period represented.

                4.1.16  No Material Adverse Change. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.1.16 between December 31, 2000 and the date hereof there has not
occurred any event or condition which has resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result, in a Material Adverse Effect.

or finder's fees or similar fees or expenses.

                4.1.18  No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby.

of equity.

                4.2.2   Litigation. There is no suit, action or other
proceeding, or injunction or final judgment relating thereto, pending, or to the
Knowledge of Buyer or its Affiliates, threatened against Buyer, before any
Governmental Authority in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit or to
obtain damages or other relief in connection with this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and no investigation that

all related fees and expenses. In addition, if and to the extent Buyer is
relying upon any financing to be provided by third parties in order to pay any
part of the Purchase Price and related fees and expenses, Buyer has received
letters from reputable lenders indicating they are highly confident they can
arrange binding financing commitments (the "Highly Confident Letters") in
amounts which, together with immediately available funds in cash or cash
equivalents of Buyer are and will at the Closing be sufficient to pay the
Purchase Price and to pay any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. True and
correct copies of the Highly Confident Letters are attached hereto as Exhibit F,
and the Highly Confident Letters are current and valid and have not been
modified in any respect.

                        (b)   Buyer has sufficient financial resources to
operate the Business after the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer has sufficient, liquid financial resources to satisfy any
applicable requirement relating to financial capacity or capital imposed by any
Governmental Authority in the state in which the Business is conducted. Buyer is
solvent, is able to pay its debts as they become due, and owns property that has
both a fair value and a fair saleable value in excess of the amount required to
pay its debts as they become due.

                4.2.5   Brokers. Buyer has not paid or become obligated to pay
any fee or commission to any broker, finder, investment banker or other
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in such a manner as to give rise to a valid claim against Seller for any
broker's or finder's fees or similar fees or expenses.

                4.2.6   Financial Statements. Without limiting the effect of
Section 4.1.15 hereof, Buyer acknowledges that, with respect to the Financial
Statements received from Seller (a) while based upon books and records that have
been maintained in accordance with GAAP, the Financial Statements themselves may
not be consistent with GAAP, or the applicable regulations of the FCC or state
regulatory authorities, and (b) because the Business represents only a portion
of Seller, the Buyer is not acquiring significant support elements located
outside the Seller Exchanges, and Buyer will or may operate under new tariffs,
carrier contracts and other conditions that will or may significantly impact the
future revenue of the Business, the Financial Statements and June 30 Financial
Data may not be representative of the financial performance of the Business
during future periods. Except to the extent that the Financial Statements or the
June 30 Financial Data reflect intentional misrepresentation or fraud, Buyer
agrees not to make any claims with respect to the Financial Statements,
including without limitation, any claim based on the performance of the Business
after the date of the Financial Statements on the basis of a comparison to the
Financial Statements.

                4.2.7   Investigation; Acknowledgment. Buyer has conducted a
review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, software, and technology of the Business and
the Acquired Assets and acknowledges that Buyer has been provided access to the
personnel and facilities of Seller and Verizon and a "data room" set up for the
purpose of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges
that neither Seller, any of its Affiliates nor any other Person makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Seller, the
Business, the Acquired Assets or otherwise or with respect to any other
information provided to Buyer, whether on behalf of Seller or such other
Persons, including as to (a) merchantability or fitness for any particular use
or purpose, (b) the operation of the Business by Buyer after the Closing in any
manner other than as used and operated by Seller or (c) the probable success or
profitability of the ownership, use or operation of the Business or the Acquired
Assets by Buyer after the Closing except for those representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement. Neither Seller nor any other Person
shall have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Buyer
or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of,
any such information, including the Confidential Information Summary dated
April, 2001 prepared by Verizon related to the Business and any information,
document or material made available to Buyer in certain "data rooms," management
presentations, conference calls or discussions with employees of Seller,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of Buyer, whether orally or in
writing, or in any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except to the extent any such data or information is expressly
contained in a representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 4.1 hereof.

                4.2.8   No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby.

consulting with Buyer, enter into, or become bound by, any new collective
bargaining agreements to the extent the new collective bargaining agreements
succeed any collective bargaining agreement that expires prior to the Closing
and, provided further that Seller may enter into customary agreements relating
to Intellectual Property with current and new employees;

                        (m)   file any report or make any modification or
adjustment to any procedure that would have a material adverse effect on any

reasonable efforts to generally maintain service level standards consistent with
past practice and maintain reasonable levels of Material and Supply Inventory;

                        (o)   enter into any transaction with its Affiliates
(other than as expressly contemplated herein) which is not terminable, at
Buyer's election, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice; and

                        (p)   write off its CBSS Accounts Receivable classified
by Seller as "unpaid final" consistent with past practice.

                5.1.2   Access. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall permit Buyer
and its authorized representatives to have reasonable access, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the Transferred Books and
Records, Owned Real Property, Leased Real Property and other Acquired Assets,
and to those employees of Seller as Buyer reasonably requests, to the extent
that such access does not materially interfere with the Business; provided, that
Buyer and any such representatives comply with the confidentiality and
nondisclosure obligations set forth in this Agreement.

                5.1.3   Consents. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.4 of this Agreement,
to obtain prior to Closing the Seller Consents. Buyer agrees to cooperate in
good faith with Seller in obtaining the Seller Consents.

                5.1.4   Debtholder Consents. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from its Lienholders the termination or release or
defeasance, at Closing, of all security agreements, mortgages and financing
statements relating to the Acquired Assets (such termination or release being
hereinafter referred to as the "Debtholder Consents"). Buyer agrees to cooperate
in good faith with Seller in obtaining the required Debtholder Consents.

                5.1.5   Financial Statements. To the extent Buyer requires the
preparation and/or audit of financial statements with respect to the Business in
order to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission under Regulations S-K and S-X or as required by any Financing
Commitment (the "SEC Basis Financial Statements"), Seller will, upon Buyer's
request, assist Buyer in the preparation of the SEC Basis Financial Statements,
and cooperate with any independent auditors chosen by Buyer to prepare and/or
audit the SEC Basis Financial Statements. Seller's cooperation will include
access to workpapers and other supporting documents used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements or such documents as may be reasonably required by such
auditors to prepare such SEC Basis Financial Statements or to render an opinion.
Buyer will bear the cost of preparation of the SEC Basis Financial Statements
and any audit.

                5.1.6   Capital Expenditures. Seller shall be obligated to make
capital expenditures with respect to the Business required to support normal
maintenance and customer growth in a manner consistent with established
regulatory performance objectives, which expenditures (exclusive of any Future
Capital Expenditure Obligations or Future Regulatory Obligations) shall not be
less than Fifty-seven Million Dollars ($57 Million) during calendar year 2001,
and not less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) during calendar year 2002,
and which amount shall be discounted on a pro rata daily basis to the extent
that the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2002 (the "Capital
Expenditure Amount"). The Capital Expenditure Amount shall be deemed to include
and not be in addition to any USF funds designated for capital projects. The
Purchase Price shall be adjusted down, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the
extent that Seller's actual capital expenditures are less than the Capital
Expenditure Amount (a "Capital Expenditure Deficiency"). In the event the
Closing does not occur prior to January 1, 2003, the Capital Expenditure Amount
shall be increased on a pro rata daily basis and Seller shall be obligated to
make capital expenditures during fiscal year 2003 in the same relative amount,
and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted in the same manner described above for
any Capital Expenditure Deficiency occurring during the period after January 1,
2003. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller will

                5.1.7   VADI Assets. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
VADI to contribute to Seller all of its right, title and interest in and to the
VADI Assets, and shall assume all liabilities of VADI that are Assumed
Liabilities hereunder pursuant to a Contribution, Assignment and Assumption
Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. The parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit
the consummation of the transfer described in this Section 5.1.7 or to
constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement, including without
limitation Section 5.1.1.

                5.1.8   Release of Liens. On or prior to the Closing, Seller
shall cause to be satisfied and released those Liens identified in Part 1 of
Schedule 4.1.7, such that Seller transfers to the Buyer, free and clear of any
lease or other Liens (other than Permitted Encumbrances), the vehicles and
equipment subject thereto as an Acquired Asset.

                5.1.9   Interim Reports. Until the Closing or termination of
this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer certain information regarding the
operations of the Business and the condition of the Acquired Assets. Seller
agrees to deliver the information set forth on Schedule 5.1.9 at the time
intervals specified in such schedule, and such other information as Buyer
reasonably requests, provided, however, that unless set forth on Schedule 5.1.9,
Seller shall not be obligated to provide any information to Buyer which is not
customarily provide by Seller to its own management. Such reports shall be
provided to Buyer within fifteen (15) Business Days following the end of a
calendar month, in the case of monthly reports, or within twenty (20) Business
Days following the end of a calendar quarter, in the case of quarterly reports;
provided, however, in no event shall Seller by obligated to provide quarterly
reports prior to Verizon's earnings announcement for such quarter. All
information provided in accordance with this Section 5.1.9 shall be subject to
compliance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement and all applicable Laws.

     5.2        Agreement of Buyer Pending the Closing. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing and except as otherwise consented to in writing by
Seller:

                5.2.1   Control of Business Pending Closing. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, rights to control or
direct the operations of Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing. Prior to
the Closing, Seller shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and subject to the express limitations of Section 5.1.1, complete
control and supervision of the operation of the Business.

                5.2.2   Contacts by Buyer. Buyer will not without the prior
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, contact any
employee, customer or supplier of Seller with respect to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Acquired Assets; provided, Buyer may
contact unions representing those employees who, upon the Closing, will be
Transferred Employees in accordance with Section 8.1.1.

                5.2.3   Highly Confident Letters. Upon request by Seller, which
request shall be no more frequently than quarterly, from the date hereof until
Closing, Buyer shall provide updated Highly Confident Letters in form and
substance satisfactory to Seller in its sole discretion (the "Quarterly
Updates"). Such Quarterly Updates shall also contain a certificate from an
authorized officer of Buyer certifying that the representations set forth in
Section 4.2.4 are true and correct as of the date of such certificate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall immediately notify Seller upon the
termination or modification of any Highly Confident Letter provided to Seller

         5.3    Covenants of Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer further covenant
and agree that, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer:

                5.3.1   State Regulatory Approval. Promptly after the date of
this Agreement, but no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Buyer
and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file the appropriate
applications and notices with the Commission seeking orders permitting the
transfer of service in the Seller Exchanges to Buyer (collectively, the
"Regulatory Approvals"). Buyer shall be responsible for seeking to establish the
tariff for its post-Closing operations in the Seller Exchanges. Each of Buyer
and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals and the parties agree to cooperate fully with each other
and with the applicable regulatory agency to obtain the Regulatory Approvals at
the earliest practicable date. In the event the Commission imposes any
condition, term or restriction as more particularly described in clauses (a) and
(b) of Section 6.3.2, each of Buyer and Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek modification or removal of such condition such that
the Regulatory Approvals shall conform to the standards set forth in Section
6.3.2.

                5.3.2   FCC Consents. Promptly after the date of this Agreement,
but no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (a) the FCC's consent to the
transfer of the FCC Licenses from Seller to Buyer and (b) the FCC waivers set

to as the "FCC Consents").

                5.3.3   HSR Act Review.

                        (a)   Within thirty (30) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, or such other time as the parties may agree, the parties will
make such filings as may be required by the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Thereafter, the parties will file
as promptly as practicable all reports or other documents required or requested
by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant
to the HSR Act or otherwise including requests for additional information
concerning such transactions, so that the waiting period specified in the HSR
Act will expire as soon as reasonably possible after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Seller and Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and oppose any
preliminary injunction sought by any Governmental Authority preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer agrees to
pay all application fees required in connection with any filings under the HSR
Act.

                        (b)   Seller and Buyer shall each cause their respective
counsel to furnish the other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions under the provisions of the HSR
Act. Seller and Buyer shall each cause their respective counsel to supply to the
other party copies of all correspondence, filings or written communications by
such party or its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority or staff members
thereof, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
related or contemplated transactions, except for documents filed pursuant to
Item 4(c) of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Form or
communications regarding the same, documents or information submitted in
response to any request for additional information or documents pursuant to the
HSR Act which reveal Seller's or Buyer's negotiating objectives or strategies or
purchase price expectations.

                5.3.4   Landlord Consents. Promptly after the date hereof, the
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually seek the
consent of the lessor to any Real Property Leases that require consent as a
condition to an assignment of the lease which consents are identified in
Schedule 4.1.6(a). If a lessor refuses to consent to a lease assignment, and if
the applicable lease permits a sublease without the consent of the lessor, the
parties hereto shall, effective as of the Closing, enter into a sublease upon
terms and conditions as similar and comparable to an assignment of the lease as
is reasonably feasible.

                5.3.5   Other Agreements. Prior to or at the Closing, each of
Buyer and Seller shall (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its applicable Affiliate to) execute and deliver to the counter-party the
Transition Plan Support Agreement, the License Agreement, and the Publishing
Agreement substantially in the forms attached hereto and such other agreements
as are set forth on Schedule 5.3.5.

                5.3.6   Insurance Coverage. On the Closing Date, the coverage
under the insurance policies and programs applicable to the Acquired Assets will
be terminated, and Buyer will be responsible for providing all insurance
coverage for the Acquired Assets.

                5.3.7   Interconnection Agreements. In cases in which Seller or
any Affiliate is a party to a contract with a competitive local exchange carrier
or an interexchange carrier for interconnection services within the Seller
Exchanges (the "Seller Interconnection Agreements"), Seller and Buyer agree that
until Closing and for a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, each
of Seller and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate
the negotiation of similar agreements and/or modifications to and assignments of
the Seller Interconnection Agreements that will transfer the benefits and
obligations of Seller contained in such Seller Interconnection Agreements to
Buyer after Closing.

                5.3.8   Designated Representative. Within fifteen (15) days of
the date of this Agreement, the parties shall each appoint a knowledgeable
representative with the necessary authority to respond to matters requiring such
party's consent. No consent shall be valid if received from a Person other than
a party's designated representative.

first audit cycle (the "Expiration Date"); provided, however, in no event shall
the Expiration Date extend beyond fifteen (15) months following the Closing
Date, and provided, further, that the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 4.1.1, 4.1.17, 4.1.18, 4.2.1, 4.2.5, 4.2.7 and 4.2.8 shall survive
the Closing without limitation.

                7.1.2   Period for Claims. This Article VII shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and the indemnification contained in this Article
VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect (a) with respect to any
claim related to the breach of any representation and warranty, until the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 7.1.1; and (b)
indefinitely (except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement), with
respect to any claim arising under Section 2.3.2 (Retained Liabilities) or 2.3.1
(Assumed Liabilities). Unless a claim for indemnification with respect to any
alleged breach of any representation or warranty is asserted by notice given as
herein provided that specifically identifies a particular breach and the
underlying facts relating thereto, which notice is given within the applicable
period of survival for such representation or warranty, such claim may not be
pursued and is irrevocably waived after such time. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, no claim for indemnification with respect
to any representation or warranty will be deemed to have been properly made
except (i) to the extent it is based upon a Third Party Claim made or brought
prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representation or
warranty, or (ii) to the extent based on Losses actually incurred by an
Indemnitee prior to the expiration of the survival period for such
representation or warranty.

     7.2        Indemnification.

                7.2.1   Indemnification Obligation of Seller. From and after the
Closing, and subject to the other provisions of this Article VII, Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (each, a "Buyer Indemnitee"
and collectively the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against all Losses incurred
or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee relating to, resulting from or arising out
of (a) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by
Seller in Section 4.1 of this Agreement, (b) a breach by Seller of any covenant
of Seller contained in this Agreement, which covenant requires performance by
Seller at or after the Closing, and (c) any of the Retained Liabilities.

                7.2.2   Indemnification Obligation of Buyer. From and after the
Closing and subject to the other provisions of this Article VII, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (each a "Seller Indemnitee"
and collectively the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against all Losses incurred
or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee relating to, resulting from or arising out
of (a) any inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties made by Buyer
in Section 4.2 of this Agreement, (b) a breach by Buyer of any covenant of Buyer
contained in this Agreement, which covenant requires performance by Buyer at or
after the Closing, (c) any of the Assumed Liabilities, (d) items payable under
Section 10.9 of this Agreement and (e) infringement or misappropriation of Third
Party Intellectual Property.

                7.2.3   Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

                        (a)   "Indemnification Payment" means any amount of
Losses required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement;

                        (b)   "Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement, either a Seller Indemnitee or a Buyer
Indemnitee as the case may be;

                        (c)   "Indemnitor" means any person or entity required
to provide indemnification under this Agreement; and

                        (d)   "Losses" means any losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and
expenses) actually incurred in connection with any actions, suits, demands,
assessments, judgments and settlements, in any such case (i) reduced by the
amount of insurance proceeds recovered from any Person with respect thereto; and
(ii) excluding any such losses, liabilities damages, costs and expenses to the
extent that the underlying liability or obligation is the result of any action
taken or omitted to be taken by any Indemnitee.

     7.3        Limitation on Claims for Indemnifiable Losses.

                7.3.1   Matters Known Prior to Closing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Closing occurs, (i) no claim
for indemnification may be asserted under Section 7.2.1 with respect to any
matter discovered by or known to Buyer on or before the Closing Date, and (ii)
no claim for indemnification may be asserted under Section 7.2.2 with respect to
any matter discovered by or known to Seller on or before the Closing Date.

                7.3.2   Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein:

                        (a)   Seller shall not be liable for any Losses with
respect to any claims by a Buyer Indemnitee under Section 7.2.1 unless, with
respect to any individual claim or series of related claims, the amount of
Losses (not otherwise indemnified) resulting therefrom exceeds Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) (the "Included Claims") and (ii) unless and until the total of
all Included Claims for indemnity or damages with respect thereto exceeds two
percent (2%) of the Purchase Price (the "Seller Threshold"), and then Seller
shall be liable for all such Included Claims in excess of the Seller Threshold.
The aggregate liability of Seller for indemnifiable Losses with respect to any
Included Claims under Section 7.2.1 hereof shall not exceed the amount which is
ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price (the "Seller Indemnification Limit")

                        (b)   No Indemnitor shall be liable to or obligated to
indemnify any Indemnitee hereunder for any consequential, special, multiple,
punitive or exemplary damages including, but not limited to, damages arising
from loss or interruption of business, profits, business opportunities or
goodwill, loss of use of facilities, loss of capital, claims of customers, or
any cost or expense related thereto, except to the extent such damages have been
recovered by a third person and are the subject of a Third Party Claim for which
indemnification is available under the express terms of this Article VII.

                        (c)   Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party
is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Losses and resolve any such
claim or liability.

                        (d)   The provisions of this Section 7.3 shall not
apply to obligations associated with the Assumed Liabilities or the Retained
Liabilities.

     7.4        Defense of Claims.

                7.4.1   Third Party Claims. If any Indemnitee receives notice
of the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any action or proceeding
by any entity that is not either a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee (a
"Third Party Claim") against such Indemnitee, with respect to which an
Indemnitor is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee will give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice thereof,
but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days after receipt of notice
of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of an Indemnitee
to notify the Indemnitor within the time period set forth herein shall only
relieve the Indemnitor from its obligation to indemnify to the extent that the
Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay (whether as a
result of the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise). Upon
receipt of notification of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled, upon written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the investigation and
defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. Whether
or not the Indemnitor elects to assume the investigation and defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
separate counsel unless (a) the employment of such separate counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnitor; (b) the Indemnitor has
failed to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within a reasonable time
after receipt of notice thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnitee; or (c) the named parties to the proceeding in which such claim,
demand, action or cause of action has been asserted include both the Indemnitor
and such Indemnitee and, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such
Indemnitee, there exists one or more defenses that may be available to the
Indemnitee that are in conflict with those available to the Indemnitor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for the fees
and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees in connection
with any one proceeding or any similar or related proceedings arising from the
same general allegations or circumstances. Without the prior written consent of
an Indemnitee, the Indemnitor will not enter into any settlement of any Third
Party Claim that would lead to liability or create any financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnitee unless such settlement includes, as an
unconditional term thereof, the release of the Indemnitee from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or such Third Party Claim is dismissed against
the Indemnitee with prejudice and without the imposition of any financial or
other obligation on the Indemnitee. If a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made to resolve a Third Party Claim and the Indemnitor notifies the
Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitor's willingness to accept the settlement
offer and pay the amount called for by such offer without reservation of any
rights or defenses against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may continue to
contest such claim, free of any participation by the Indemnitor, and the amount
of any ultimate liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnitor has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of
(x) the amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnitee declined to accept
plus the Losses of the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party Claim through the
date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (y) the aggregate Losses of the
Indemnitee with respect to such claim.

                7.4.2   Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnitee for Losses
that do not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted
by giving the Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the incurrence thereof, and
the Indemnitor will have a period of thirty (30) calendar days within which to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond
within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Indemnitor will be deemed to
have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms and subject to
the provisions of this Article VII.

                7.4.3   Subrogation. If after the making of any Indemnification
Payment the amount of the Losses to which such payment relates is reduced by
recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to
any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the
amount of such reduction (less any costs, expenses, premiums or Taxes incurred
in connection therewith) will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnitor. Upon making any Indemnification Payment, the Indemnitor will, to the
extent of such Indemnification Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnitee against any third party that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnitee in
respect of the Losses to which the Indemnification Payment relates; provided
that (a) the Indemnitor shall then be in compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement in respect of such Losses, and (b) until the Indemnitee recovers
full payment of its Losses, all claims of the Indemnitor against any such third
party on account of said Indemnification Payment will be subrogated and
subordinated in right of payment to the Indemnitee's rights against such third
party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision of this
Article VII, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described
subrogation and subordination rights.

     7.5        No Indemnifiable Claims Resulting from Governmental Authority
Action. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any indemnifiable or
otherwise compensable claim that any of Seller's representations or warranties
in this Agreement are inaccurate, or that any covenant has been breached, if
such claim is predicated on any action by a Governmental Authority (other than a
tax authority) undertaken after Closing or any action a Governmental Authority
(other than a tax authority) requires Buyer to undertake after Closing;
provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to the extent such
action by a Governmental Authority (other than a tax authority) arises directly
out of any (a) willful misconduct by Seller as judicially determined by a final
order of a court or Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction; or (ii)
conduct by Seller that was not reasonably prudent based on then-prevailing
circumstances and, provided further that Seller's reliance on a reasonable
interpretation of existing Law or practice shall be deemed reasonably prudent.

     7.6        Other Rights and Remedies. Following the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy at law for Seller or Buyer for any claim (whether such claim is
framed in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in this Agreement shall be
a claim by Seller or Buyer for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                         EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS

     8.1        Employment of Transferred Employees. Schedule 8.1 lists the
Active Employees (as defined below) of the Business as of the date of this
Agreement, together with their job positions, service and compensation. An
employee hired by Seller or its Affiliate after the date of this Agreement who
would be an Active Employee but for not being employed on the date of this
Agreement shall become an Active Employee as of his or her date of hire. In
hiring new employees and terminating employees of the Business, Seller and its
Affiliates shall follow their usual and ordinary course of business in
accordance with past practice. An Active Employee who terminates employment with
Seller prior to the Closing shall no longer be considered an Active Employee
(without regard to the reason or circumstance for such termination). To the
extent required by the foregoing, a final updated Schedule 8.1 shall be provided
to Buyer on or immediately prior to the Closing Date. All Active Employees of
the Business on the Closing Date (collectively, the "Transferred Employees")
shall be employed by (or become the responsibility of, as applicable) Buyer as
of the Closing Date in the same or comparable positions, and at the same or
comparable total compensation (including base pay and bonus), as were in effect
on the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. An
individual shall be considered an "Active Employee" of the Business if the
individual is employed by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller and (i) provides
substantially all of his or her services to or for the Business or (ii) provides
inter-unit support services to the Business and/or similar businesses of the
Seller and its Affiliates and is designated as an "Inter-Unit Services Employee"
on Schedule 8.1. The number of Inter-Unit Services Employees designated on
Schedule 8.1 for each job function of the Business shall be equal to the whole
number of full-time equivalent positions (as reasonably determined by Seller on
the basis of a standard workweek and taking into account all employees of Seller
and its Affiliates who provide more than de minimis services for the Business
other than those employees listed on Schedule 8.1 pursuant to subparagraph (i)
above) utilized in the Business for such job function. The determination of
"Active Employees" shall include all full-time and part-time employees,
employees on workers' compensation, military leave, maternity leave, leave under
the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, short-term disability (except to the
extent that any such employee subsequently goes on long-term disability due to
the pre-Closing condition resulting in short-term disability leave), or layoff
with recall rights, and employees on other approved leaves of absence with a
legal or contractual right to reinstatement. Any individuals who would be
"Transferred Employees" but for their being on long-term disability shall be
offered a position by Buyer in the event they recover within twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date; provided that if any such employee subsequently returns
to long-term disability as a result of the pre-Closing condition resulting in
such long-term disability, Seller shall be responsible for providing such
coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, individuals who would otherwise be
considered "Active Employees" but who are designated by Seller as "Retained
Employees" on Schedule 8.1(a) shall not be considered "Active Employees" for
purposes of this Agreement, and individuals who would not otherwise be
considered "Active Employees" but who are designated by Seller as "Included
Employees" on Schedule 8.1(b) shall be considered "Active Employees" for
purposes of this Agreement. For a period of twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not employ, and Buyer shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to employ, any person who retires or otherwise terminates from any
employment at or in association with the Business during the six-(6) month
period beginning three (3) months before the Closing Date.

                8.1.1   Assumption of Labor Contract Obligations. On and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all of the employer's obligations under,
and be bound by the provisions of, each Labor Contract covering Transferred
Employees. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in Buyer's efforts to contact the
unions representing Transferred Employees. If a union representing Transferred
Employees objects to Buyer's assumption of, or refuses to allow Buyer to assume,
the provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement that covers such
Transferred Employees immediately before the Closing Date, or objects to any
change in or termination of employee benefits on or after the Closing Date,
Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability or obligation to Buyer by
reason of such objection or refusal.

                8.1.2   Assumption of Employment and Other Agreements. On and
after the Closing Date, except (a) as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in
Schedule 8.1.2 or (b) to the extent arising as a result of the breach by Seller
of the representations or covenants contained in Sections 4.1.9, 4.1.13 or 5.1.1
hereof, Buyer, as successor employer to Seller, shall assume all obligations
under and be bound by the provisions of each offer of employment by Seller and
its Affiliates relating to the Business, each Employment Agreement or any other
agreement by Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to conditions of
employment, Intellectual Property, employment separation, severance, or employee
benefits in connection with the Business; provided, however, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain the right to enforce agreements relating to Intellectual
Property. Schedule 8.1.2 lists the obligations, as of the date hereof, to be
assumed by Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.1.2.

                8.1.3   No Creation of Objection Rights. This Agreement does not
create any right of an employee or union to object or to refuse to assent to the
Seller's assignment of or Buyer's assumption of or succession to any Employment
Agreement, Labor Contract, or other agreement relating to conditions of
employment, employment separation, severance or employee benefits, nor shall
this Agreement be construed as recognizing that any such rights exist.

                8.1.4   Recognition of Transferred Employee Service. Except as
otherwise provided herein, on and after the Closing Date, and subject to the
provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, Buyer shall
recognize for all employment-related purposes the service of each Transferred
Employee with Seller and its Affiliates. Schedule 8.1 shall list such service
for each Transferred Employee. Except to the extent required by Section 8.2.1,
Buyer shall not be required to credit any Transferred Employee with prior
service for purposes of benefit accrual or contributions under any defined
benefit pension plan or other retirement plan.

                8.1.5   Assumption of Obligation to Pay Bonuses. Transferred
Employees shall not accrue benefits under any employee benefit policies, plans,
arrangements, programs, practices, or agreements of Seller or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing Date. Buyer shall assume the obligation to pay to
Transferred Employees a pro-rated portion of any bonuses that would have been
payable to the Transferred Employees with respect to the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs had the Transferred Employees remained employees of
Seller or one of its Affiliates. Such pro-rated portion shall be equal to the
portion of the bonus that would have accrued during the portion of the calendar
year occurring after the Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable bonus policy, plan, arrangement, program, practice or agreement of
Seller and its Affiliates. Seller shall pay the remaining pro-rated portion of
such bonuses in the ordinary course and at the time such bonuses would have been
paid without regard to this Agreement.

                8.1.6   No Duplicate Benefits. Nothing in this Agreement shall
cause duplicate benefits to be paid or provided to or with respect to a
Transferred Employee under any employee benefit policies, plans, arrangements,
programs, practices, or agreements. References herein to a benefit with respect
to a Transferred Employee shall include, where applicable, benefits with respect
to any eligible dependents and beneficiaries of such Transferred Employee under
the same employee benefit policy, plan, arrangement, program, practice or
agreement.

                8.1.7   Affiliate Employees. If any employee identified in
Schedule 8.1 is an employee of an Affiliate of Seller, he or she shall be
considered a Transferred Employee and shall be treated under this Agreement in a
manner that is comparable to the treatment given to the Transferred Employees
who are employed by Seller. Seller and its Affiliates shall take and/or cause to
be taken any action necessary to ensure that the Transferred Employees and any
Included Employees are employed by or transferred to Seller no later than
immediately prior to the Closing to allow Buyer to assume the employment
obligations contemplated by Section 8.1.

     8.2        Transferred Employee Benefit Matters.

                8.2.1   Defined Benefit Plans.

                        (a)   Management Employees. Effective immediately after
the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees who participate in the Verizon GTE
Service Corporation Plan for Employees' Pensions (the "Seller Salaried Pension
Plan") will be eligible to participate under a tax-qualified defined benefit
pension plan established or maintained by Buyer to the same extent (if any) as
similarly-situated employees of Buyer. Such Transferred Employees shall receive
credit for their service with Seller and its Affiliates under such Buyer pension
plan for all purposes other than benefit accrual service. Other than direct
rollover distributions, if any are permitted, no assets or liabilities will be
transferred in connection with this Agreement from the Seller Salaried Pension
Plan to Buyer or any benefit plan of buyer.

                        (b)   Represented Employees. Buyer shall take all
actions necessary and appropriate to ensure that, as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date, Buyer maintains or adopts one or more pension plans
(hereinafter referred to in the aggregate as the "Buyer Pension Plans" and
individually as the "Buyer Pension Plan") and to ensure that each Buyer Pension
Plan satisfies the following requirements as of the Closing Date: (i) the Buyer
Pension Plan is a qualified, single-employer defined benefit plan under Section
401(a) of the Code; (ii) any Buyer Pension Plan that was in effect before the
Closing Date shall not have any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in
Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived,
immediately before the Closing Date; (iii) the Buyer Pension Plan is not the
subject of termination proceedings or a notice of termination under Title IV of
ERISA; (iv) the Buyer Pension Plan does not exclude Transferred Employees who
were participants in the "GTE Midwest Inc. Plan for Hourly-Paid Employees'
Pensions" (the "Seller Hourly Pension Plan") on the Closing Date from
eligibility to participate therein; (v) the Buyer Pension Plan does not violate
the requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement; and (vi)
with respect to Transferred Employees who were participants in the Seller Hourly
Pension Plan on the Closing Date, the terms of the Buyer Pension Plan are
substantially identical in all material respects to the terms of the Seller
Hourly Pension Plan. Within the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding any
transfer of assets and liabilities from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan to a
Buyer Pension Plan pursuant to Section 8.2.1, Buyer shall provide Seller with a
written certification, in a form acceptable to Seller, that the Buyer Pension
Plan satisfies each of the requirements set forth in this Section 8.2.1(b).

                        (c)   Transfer of Liabilities.

                              (i)     Buyer shall cause the Buyer Pension Plans
to accept all liabilities for benefits under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan
whether or not vested, that would have been paid or payable (but for the
transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section 8.2.1) to or with
respect to the Transferred Employees under the terms of the Seller Hourly
Pension Plan that have accrued under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan to or with
respect to the Transferred Employees based on accredited service and
compensation under the Seller Pension Plans as of the Closing Date.

                              (ii)    For purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the Buyer Pension Plans, each Transferred Employee whose accrued benefit
is transferred from a Seller Hourly Pension Plan to a Buyer Pension Plan shall
be credited with service and compensation as of the Closing Date as determined
under the terms of the Seller Hourly Pension Plan. The benefit under the Buyer
Pension Plan for each Transferred Employee who, on the Closing Date,
participates in the Seller Hourly Pension Plan, shall be calculated under terms
of the Buyer Pension Plan that are substantially identical in all material
respects to the terms of the Seller Hourly Pension Plan.

                              (iii)   As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a list reflecting each Transferred
Employee's service and compensation under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan.

                        (d)   Transfer of Assets.

                              (i)     Seller shall direct the trustee of the
Seller Hourly Pension Plan to transfer to the trustee or funding agent of the
Buyer Pension Plan the amount required to be transferred by Section 414(1) of
the Code and the regulations thereunder for all Transferred Employees whose
accrued benefits are transferred to a Buyer Pension Plan pursuant to subsection
(c) of this Section 8.2.1, determined using the assumptions used by the PBGC
with respect to a plan termination occurring on the Closing Date (the "Pension
Assets"), as set forth on Schedule 8.2.1(d)(i), subject to any adjustment
pursuant to subsection (d)(vi) of this Section 8.2. The Pension Assets shall be
in the form of cash or marketable obligations. Under no circumstances shall
Seller or the Seller Hourly Pension Plan be liable to transfer any additional
amount to Buyer or a Buyer Pension Plan or any other Person in respect of the
accrued benefits transferred to a Buyer Pension Plan pursuant to subsection (c)
of this Section 8.2.1, including but not limited to any circumstance under which
any Person (including a Governmental Authority) states a claim to some portion
or all of the Pension Assets.

                              (ii)    Seller shall appoint an actuary ("Seller's
Actuary") to determine the amount to be transferred pursuant to subsection
(d)(i) of this Section 8.2.1 and shall provide such determination to Buyer.
Buyer shall appoint an actuary ("Buyer's Actuary") who shall have the right to
audit and review the determination made by Seller's Actuary. Within thirty (30)
days after the date Seller informs Buyer of the amount of the Pension Assets,
Seller's Actuary shall provide Buyer's Actuary with a computer file containing
all the employee data used by Seller's Actuary to calculate the Pension Assets.
If Buyer's Actuary is unable to agree with Seller's Actuary on the amount of the
transfer within sixty (60) days after Seller informs Buyer of the amount to be
transferred, Seller and Buyer shall jointly select a third actuary, whose
determination shall be binding on Seller and Buyer. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of their respective actuaries, and the
fees, costs and expense of the third actuary shall be borne one-half by Seller
and one-half by Buyer.

                              (iii)   The Pension Assets shall be credited with
interest from the Closing Date to the actual date of transfer at the assumed
discount rate used in accordance with paragraph (i) of this subsection (d);
provided that any Pension Assets that are distributed from the Seller Hourly
Pension Plan before the date of transfer pursuant to subsection (d)(vi) of this
Section 8.2.1 shall be credited with interest (such interest to be credited to
the Buyer Pension Plans) only from the Closing Date to the date of distribution.

                              (iv)    Under the terms of the Buyer Pension Plan,
the accrued benefit of each Transferred Employee immediately after the transfer
of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section 8.2.1 shall not be less than
the sum of each Transferred Employee's accrued benefits under the applicable
Seller Hourly Pension Plan and the Buyer Pension Plan (if any) immediately
before the transfer of assets and liabilities.

                              (v)     In connection with the transfer of assets
and liabilities pursuant to this Section 8.2.1, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other in making all appropriate filings required by the Code or ERISA
and the regulations thereunder, and the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to this Section 8.2.1 shall not take place until as soon as practicable
after the latest of (A) the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following
the filing of any required notices with the IRS pursuant to Section 6058(b) of
the Code, or (B) the date Buyer has delivered to Seller (xx) a copy of the Buyer

the effect that the Buyer Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, together with documentation reasonably satisfactory to Seller of the due
adoption of any amendments to the Buyer Pension Plan required by the IRS as a
condition to such qualification and a certification from Buyer that no events
have occurred that adversely affect the continued validity of such determination
letter (apart from the enactment of any Federal law for which the remedial
amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired), and (yy)
information enabling the enrolled actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan to issue
the certification required by Section 6058(b) of the Code.

                              (vi)    If, after the Closing Date and before the
date of transfer of assets and liabilities from the Seller Hourly Pension Plan
pursuant to this Section 8.2.1, the accrued benefit as of the Closing Date
becomes payable under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan to or with respect to a
Transferred Employee, Seller shall instruct the trustee of the Seller Hourly
Pension Plan to pay such benefits, and the assets to be transferred from the
Seller Hourly Pension Plan shall be reduced accordingly.

                              (vii)   Seller, Buyer, the Seller Hourly Pension
Plan and the Buyer Pensions Plans shall assist and cooperate with each other in
the transfer of Pension Assets and the disposition of claims made under the
Buyer Pension Plans and Sourly Hourly Pension Plan pursuant to this Section
8.2.1 and in providing each other with any record, documents or other
information within its control that is reasonably requested by any other party
as necessary to the disposition, settlement or defense of such claim.

                8.2.2   Savings Plans.

                        (a)   As of the date of this Agreement, Seller
participates in the Verizon GTE Savings Plan and the Verizon GTE Hourly Savings
Plan (collectively referred to as the "Seller Savings Plans"). Except as
provided in subsection (c) below, Transferred Employees shall not be entitled to
make contributions to or to benefit from matching or other contributions under
the Seller Savings Plans on and after the Closing Date.

                        (b)   Buyer shall take all action necessary and
appropriate to ensure that, as of the Closing Date, Buyer maintains one or more
savings plans (hereinafter referred to in the aggregate as the "Buyer Savings
Plans" and individually as the "Buyer Savings Plan") that will accept rollovers
from Transferred Employees who receive distributions from the Seller Savings
Plans.

                        (c)   Seller shall make all required matching
contributions with respect to the Transferred Employees' contributions to the
Seller Savings Plans that are (i) eligible for matching and (ii) made before the
Closing Date. Such matching contributions shall be made not later than the date
on which all other matching contributions are made to the Seller Savings Plans
with respect to contributions made at the same time as the Transferred
Employees' contributions.

                  8.2.3       Welfare Plans.

                        (a)   Buyer shall take all action necessary and
appropriate to ensure that, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer
maintains or adopts, as of the Closing Date, one or more employee welfare
benefit plans, including medical, health, dental, flexible spending account,
accident, life, short-term disability, and long-term disability and other
employee welfare benefit plans for the benefit of (i) the non-bargained
Transferred Employees (the "Non-Union Welfare Plans") and (ii) the
union-represented Transferred Employees in accordance with the provisions of
applicable collective bargaining agreements (the "Bargained Welfare Plans"). The
Non-Union Welfare Plans and the Bargained Welfare Plans are hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Buyer Welfare Plans." The Buyer Welfare Plans shall
provide as of the Closing Date pre-retirement benefits to Transferred Employees
(and their dependents and beneficiaries) that, in the aggregate, are comparable
to the pre-retirement benefits to which they were entitled under the
corresponding employee welfare benefit plans maintained by Seller on the Closing
Date (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Seller Welfare Plans"). Any
restrictions on coverage for pre-existing conditions or requirements for
evidence of insurability under the Buyer Welfare Plans shall be waived for
Transferred Employees, and Transferred Employees shall receive credit under the
Buyer Welfare Plans for co-payments and payments under a deductible limit made
by them and for out-of-pocket maximums applicable to them during the plan year
of the Seller Welfare Plan in accordance with the corresponding Seller Welfare
Plans. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a list of each Transferred Employee's co-payment amounts, and deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under the Seller Welfare Plans.

                        (b)   (i)     Except as otherwise provided in subsection
(b)(ii) of this Section (b) or in an applicable collective bargaining agreement,
Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided retiree medical, health, and life
benefits to each Transferred Employee under substantially comparable terms and
conditions as apply to similarly situated employees of Buyer as of the date of
this Agreement, and Seller shall have no obligation to provide retiree medical
and life benefits to any Transferred Employee on or after the Closing Date.

                              (ii)    Following the termination of employment
from Buyer and its Affiliates of a Transferred Employee who is not covered by a
Labor Contract and who, as of the Closing Date, has at least fifteen (15) years
of accredited service (within the meaning of the Seller Salaried Pension Plan)
and combined years of age and accredited service of at least 74 (within the
meaning of the Seller Salaried Pension Plan), Seller shall provide or cause to
be provided to each such Transferred Employee (or the dependents or
beneficiaries of such Transferred Employee) retiree medical, health, and life
benefits under the terms and conditions of the corresponding programs then
offered by Seller to its similarly situated non-collectively bargained employees
retiring at such time; provided that nothing in this subsection (b)(ii) shall be
construed to prevent any such Transferred Employee (or his or her dependents or
beneficiaries) from voluntarily relinquishing such benefits. Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the cost of the retiree medical, health and life coverage
for which Seller is responsible and that Seller actually provides pursuant to
this subsection (b)(ii). For each year for which Buyer is required to reimburse
Seller under this subsection (b)(ii), Buyer shall pay Seller annually in
arrears, within thirty (30) days after Seller provides a statement therefor to
Buyer: (A) $4,500 with respect to each eligible Transferred Employee who has not
yet attained age 65 during the year for which the payment is made and $4,500
with respect to each spouse who is covered with respect to an eligible
Transferred Employee and who has not yet attained 65 during the year for which
the payment is made, and (B) $2,000 with respect to each eligible Transferred
Employee who has attained at least age 65 during the year for which the payment
is made and $2,000 with respect to each spouse who is covered with respect to an
eligible Transferred Employee and who has attained at least age 65 during the
year for which the payment is made. No reimbursement shall be due with respect
to any dependent, other than a spouse, covered with respect to an eligible
Transferred Employee. The reimbursement obligation for partial years shall be
prorated based on the portion of the year covered by the obligation.

                        (c)   Seller, Buyer, their respective Affiliates, and
the Seller Welfare Plans and the Buyer Welfare Plans shall assist and cooperate
with each other in the disposition of claims made under the Seller Welfare Plans
or the Buyer Welfare Plans and in providing each other with any records,
documents, or other information within its control or to which it has access
that is reasonably requested by any other as necessary or appropriate to the
disposition, settlement, or defense of such claims.

                        (d)   Except for the Flexible Reimbursement Plan (the
"FRP") account balances described in Section 8.2.3(e), nothing in this Agreement
shall require Seller or its Affiliates to transfer assets or reserves with
respect to the Seller Welfare Plans to Buyer or the Buyer Welfare Plans.

                        (e)   As of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
portion of the FRP applicable to Transferred Employees to be segregated into a
separate component and all account balances of the Transferred Employees in the
FRP shall be transferred to a flexible reimbursement plan that Buyer shall cause
to be maintained for the duration of the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

     8.3        Severance Benefits. On and for a period of at least three (3)
years after the Closing Date, Transferred Employees not subject to a collective
bargaining agreement shall be eligible for benefits under a Buyer severance or
separation pay policy or plans that provides a benefit of two weeks of base
compensation for each year of service (plus a prorated amount for each partial
year of service, such service determined by taking into account service with
Seller and its Affiliates and service with Buyer and its Affiliates), up to a
maximum of fifty-two (52) weeks, to employees who separate from service for any
reason other than cause; provided that the amount of the severance benefit shall
not be less than the executive minimum severance benefit for the employees
listed on Schedule 8.3. Except as specifically provided otherwise in the
relevant Seller severance pay plan, each Transferred Employee listed on Schedule
8.1 shall be treated as a "Transferred Employee" for purposes of the Seller
Salaried Pension Plan and shall not be entitled to severance benefits (including
under the Qualified Involuntary Separation Program) from Seller or any plan or
policy it maintains. Seller shall take any actions necessary or appropriate in
respect of the immediately preceding sentence.

     8.4        Vacation Benefits. On or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
allow Transferred Employees to receive paid time off in the calendar year of the
Closing for any unused vacation time accrued prior to the Closing Date. Seller
and its Affiliates shall have no liability to Transferred Employees for the
vacation payments described the immediately preceding sentence. Seller shall pay
Transferred Employees any banked vacation on or as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall have no liability for such banked vacation
benefits. Schedule 8.1 referenced above shall list the accrued but unused
vacation pay, as of the Closing Date, of each Transferred Employee for the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

     8.5        Employee Rights. Nothing herein expressed or implied shall
confer upon any employee of Seller or its Affiliates, or Buyer or its
Affiliates, or upon any legal representative of such employee, or upon any
collective bargaining agent, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to confer upon any person (nor any beneficiary thereof) any
rights under or with respect to any plan, program, or arrangement described in
or contemplated by this Agreement, and each person (and any beneficiary thereof)
shall be entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program,
or arrangement for his or her rights thereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall
cause Buyer or its Affiliates, nor Seller or its Affiliates to have any
obligation to provide employment or any employee benefits to any individual who
is not a Transferred Employee or, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.1.2
with respect to employment agreements, to continue to employ any Transferred
Employee for any period of time following the Closing Date.

     8.6        Successors and Assigns. In the event Buyer or any of its
successors and assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that such successors and assigns of Buyer honor the obligations
of Buyer and its Affiliates set forth in this Article VIII. In the event Buyer
outsources any of the Transferred Employees during the three-year period
described in Section 8.3, and such employees are not paid a severance benefit in
accordance with Section 8.3, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the outsourcing vendor maintains a severance pay plan or policy
that provides a severance benefit for each Transferred Employee who is
involuntarily terminated by the outsourcing vendor during such three-year
period, which benefit is the same as the severance benefits that would otherwise
have been provided to such employees in accordance with Section 8.3. For
purposes of this Section 8.6, a Transferred Employee shall be considered to have
been outsourced if the employee is hired by the outsourcing vendor pursuant to
or in connection with an agreement entered into between Buyer or any of its
Affiliates and the outsourcing vendor whereby the outsourcing vendor will
provide services to or for the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                        CONTINUING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

     9.1        Transition Plan Support Agreement. The parties agree to
cooperate with one another to ensure that the transition of the ownership of the
Acquired Assets proceeds with minimal disruption to the services being provided
to subscribers in the Seller Exchanges. The parties agree that it may be
necessary for Seller to assist Buyer in converting Seller's systems and
processes with respect to the Acquired Assets to Buyer's systems and processes.
Seller and Buyer agree to execute on or before the Closing Date a separate
"Transition Plan Support Agreement" substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit E for the provision of such services.

     9.2        Directory Publishing.

                9.2.1   Certain Directory Publishing Agreement Rights and
Obligations. Seller is party to that certain publishing agreement dated January
1, 2000 with Verizon Information Services Inc. f/k/a GTE Information Services
Incorporated ("Publisher"). Pursuant to this agreement Publisher has the right
to sell advertising, and the obligation to publish, print and distribute
directories containing telephone numbers relating to the Seller Exchanges. Buyer
and Publisher shall execute a new publishing agreement on or before the Closing
Date effective as of the Closing as it relates to the Seller Exchanges, which
agreement shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the
"Publishing Agreement"). Such Publishing Agreement shall provide Buyer with a
fifty-two percent (52%) revenue share in print directory advertising for the
period after Closing for all directories in use at the time of Closing (i.e.,
having been published within the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing
Date), and those Verizon-branded directories in current sales campaigns or
post-sales publishing cycles at Closing.

                9.2.2   Co-Bound Directories Acknowledgement. Buyer acknowledges
that Publisher may have a pre-existing obligation (which Publisher may choose to
continue) to sell advertising, publish, print and distribute the telephone
numbers of third party local exchange telephone companies in the same directory
as the Seller Exchanges ("Co-Bound Directory"). Verizon Information Services
Inc. has informed Seller that all such arrangements are as set forth on Schedule
9.2.2 and, to Seller's knowledge, no arrangements exist except as are identified
on Schedule 9.2.2.

                                   ARTICLE X
                      ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

     10.1       Intellectual Property.

                10.1.1  No License. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree
that, except and to the extent expressly set forth in writing in the License
Agreement and in Section 10.1.3, Seller has not granted any rights or licenses,
express or implied, and nothing shall constitute or be construed as a license or
other right by Seller under any Intellectual Property now or hereafter owned,
obtained or licensable by Seller or under any Third Party Intellectual Property.

                10.1.2  Infringement.

                        (a)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless
Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of their customers, from any damages, costs
or expenses resulting from any obligation, proceeding or suit based upon any
claim that any activity subsequent to the Closing Date engaged in by Buyer, a
customer of Buyer's, or anyone claiming under Buyer, constitutes direct or
contributory infringement, misuse or misappropriation of, or inducement to
infringe, any Third Party Intellectual Property.

                        (b)   Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
resulting from any obligation, proceeding or suit based upon any claim alleging
or asserting direct or contributory infringement, or misuse or misappropriation
of, or inducement to infringe by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any Third
Party Intellectual Property, to the extent that such claim is based on, or would
not have arisen but for, activity conducted or engaged in subsequent to the
Closing Date by Buyer, a customer of Buyer's or anyone claiming under Buyer.

                10.1.3  Trademark Phaseout.

                        (a)   Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller or its
Affiliates are the legal and beneficial owners of Excluded Marks that qualify as
Excluded Assets under Section 2.1.2. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Excluded Marks, or any right to or license of the Excluded Marks, including any
right to use, are not being transferred or conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement. Buyer acknowledges the exclusive and proprietary rights of Seller and
its Affiliates in the use of the Excluded Marks, and Buyer agrees that it shall
not use the Excluded Marks (or any names, domain names, marks or indicia
confusingly similar to the Excluded Marks) except and to the extent expressly
set forth in this Section 10.1.3, or otherwise assert any rights or claims in
such Excluded Marks (or in any names, domain names, marks or when confusingly
similar to the Excluded Marks). Except as set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 10.1.3(a), after the Closing, all Excluded Marks of Seller and its
Affiliates shall be replaced by Buyer, at Buyer's expense, as soon as possible,
but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the
"Phaseout Period") for items existing as of the Closing Date with Excluded Marks
affixed to them which Buyer has continued to use in Buyer's operation of the
Business, including buildings, vehicles, heavy equipment, hard hats, tools, tool
boxes, kits (safety and others) signs, public (pay) telephones, manual covers
and notebooks. After the Closing, Buyer will not use, and will immediately
destroy or deliver to Seller, all items with Excluded Marks affixed to them that
have no valid continuing use in Buyer's operation of the Business, including
items affecting customer or employee relations or items that do not reflect
Buyer's true identity. Specific items to be destroyed or returned include
giveaways; order, purchase or materials forms; requisitions; invoices;
statements; time sheets/labor reports; bill inserts; stationery; personalized
note pads; business cards; maps; organization charts; bulletins/releases;

already published or closed for publication at the Closing Date shall be
extended to the expiration date of such directories.

                        (b)   Buyer recognizes the great value of the goodwill
associated with the Excluded Marks, and acknowledges and agrees that the
Excluded Marks and all rights therein and the goodwill pertaining thereto belong
exclusively to Seller and that the Excluded Marks have a secondary meaning in
the minds of the public. Buyer further agrees that any and all permitted use of
the Excluded Marks pursuant to this Agreement shall inure to the sole and
exclusive benefit of Seller.

                        (c)   Buyer agrees that any permitted use of the
Excluded Marks in the operation of the Business after the Closing shall be
provided in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local Laws, and to
the additional terms and conditions as set forth in the License Agreement and
that the same shall not reflect adversely upon the good name of Seller or its
Affiliates, and that the operation of the Business will be of a high standard
and skill.

                        (d)   Buyer acknowledges that its failure to cease use
of the Excluded Marks as provided in this Agreement, or its improper use of the
Excluded Marks, will result in immediate and irreparable harm to Seller and its
Affiliates. Buyer acknowledges and admits that there is no adequate remedy at
law for such failure to terminate use of the Excluded Marks, or for such
improper use of the Excluded Marks. Buyer agrees that in the event of such
failure or improper use, Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
equitable relief by way of temporary restraining order, or preliminary or
permanent injunction, or any other relief available under this Agreement.

                        (e)   Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall contest
the ownership or validity of any rights of Seller or its Affiliates in the
Excluded Marks.

                10.1.4  Third Party Software. To the extent that the transfer
of Acquired Assets by Seller to Buyer under this Agreement results in the
transfer of possession to Buyer of software that, at the Closing Date, is Third
Party Intellectual Property, which software was located in and rightfully used
by Seller in the geographical area of the Seller Exchanges prior to the Closing
Date in the normal and ordinary operation of the Business pursuant to Contracts
with the owners or licensors of such software ("Third Party Intellectual
Property Contracts"), Seller agrees to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer in
securing license rights in such Third Party Intellectual Property on terms and
conditions similar to those set forth in the Third Party Intellectual Property
Contracts; provided, however, Seller agrees to assign to Buyer, at Buyer's
expense, the Third Party Intellectual Property Contracts with Switch Software
Vendors for the Switch Software used with the Acquired Assets, to the extent
Seller has the right or obtains the right to do so, and Buyer agrees to comply
with the terms and conditions of such Third Party Intellectual Property
Contracts and to indemnify Seller for any breaches thereof or failures to comply
therewith from and after the Closing. Such Third Party Intellectual Property
Contracts with Switch Software Vendors are as set forth on Schedule 10.1.4.
Buyer understands and agrees that, except and to the extent the Third Party
Intellectual Property Contracts for such Switch Software are assigned to Buyer,
no rights or licenses to use or possess such software or any Third Party
Intellectual Property are transferred to Buyer. Buyer shall properly dispose of,
and shall not use, any software or other Third Party Intellectual Property of
which Buyer acquires possession or control in connection with Acquired Assets
unless and to the extent Buyer enters into written agreements with such third
parties for the use of such software or other Third Party Intellectual Property.
Seller makes no warranty or representation as to any matter relating to Third
Party Intellectual Property or Third Party Intellectual Property Contracts.

     10.2       Confidentiality. Whether or not the Closing occurs, the parties
and their respective officers, directors, employees and representatives shall
comply with the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the provisions of which are expressly
incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference.

     10.3       Further Assurances. For a period of one hundred eighty (180)
days after the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish to Buyer such other instruments and information as Buyer may reasonably
request in order to convey to Buyer title to the Acquired Assets, to be
delivered from time to time upon Buyer's reasonable request.

     10.4       Prorations.

                (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section
10.4(a), any liability that calls for periodic payments shall be prorated
between Seller and Buyer including, without limitation: (i) utility charges
(which shall include water, sewer, electricity, gas and other utility charges)
with respect to the Owned Real Property, the property subject to the Real
Property Leases and customer owned equipment, (ii) rental charges (which shall
include rental charges and other lease payments under the Real Property Leases),
(iii) personal services (where the services charged for straddle the period both
before and after the Closing Date, including charges for contract labor), and
(iv) real and personal property taxes, ad valorem taxes and other similar taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, (v) franchise fees, regulatory assessments or taxes
and (vi) such other liability that individually calls for periodic payments in
excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000). With respect to measurement periods
during which the Closing Date occurs (all such periods of time being hereinafter
called "Proration Periods"). The liabilities described in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii), (v) and (vi) of the preceding sentence shall be apportioned between
Seller and Buyer as of the Closing Date, with Buyer bearing only the expense
thereof in direct proportion to the number of days remaining in the applicable
Proration Period including and following the Closing Date in comparison to the
total number of days covered by such Proration Period. The liabilities described
in clause (iv) of the preceding sentence shall be prorated between Buyer and
Seller based on the relative periods the Acquired Assets was owned by each
respective party during the fiscal period for which such taxes were imposed by
the taxing jurisdiction (as such fiscal period is reflected on the bill rendered
by such taxing jurisdiction). Buyer and Seller shall pay or be reimbursed for
real and personal property taxes (including instances in which such property
taxes have been paid before the Closing Date) on this prorated basis. If a
payment on a tax bill is due after the Closing, the party that is legally
required to make such payment shall make such payment and promptly forward an
invoice to the other party for its pro rata share, if any. If the other party
does not pay the invoice within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt, the amount
of such payment shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate. Similarly, all
prepayments made by Seller with respect to service or maintenance agreements
with third parties or license or other fees payable to third parties and
assigned to Buyer hereunder shall be prorated on an appropriate basis between
Seller and Buyer.

                (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section
10.4(a), Seller shall not be responsible to pay, or to indemnify Buyer for, any
federal universal service fund charge which is due after the Closing Date with
respect to the Business, and all such charges shall be the responsibility of
Buyer and shall be considered to be Assumed Liabilities which are described in
Section 2.3.1. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the due date
of a federal universal service fund charge shall be the date by which payment of
such charge must be received by the Universal Service Administrative Company
("USAC"), or any successor thereto, in order to avoid late payment charges, as
per the statement of account from USAC. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 10.4(b), (i) Seller shall be responsible to pay and shall
indemnify Buyer for any billed federal universal service fund charge with
respect to the Business for every month reflected on such statement of account
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date and for the pro rata portion of any
month during which the Closing Date occurs; and (ii) Buyer shall be responsible
to pay and shall indemnify Seller for any billed federal universal service
contribution liability assessed by USAC with respect to the Business for every
month reflected on such statement of account that ends after the Closing Date
and for the pro rata portion of any month during which the Closing Date occurs,
it being understood by Buyer that such assessments may be based on operations of
the Business prior to the Closing Date.

     10.5       Cost Studies/Toll and Access Settlement Matters.

                10.5.1  Prior to Closing. Seller agrees that, with respect to
all toll, access or other such revenues or expenses, settlements, pools,
separations studies, USF funds or similar activities, Seller shall be
responsible for (and shall receive the benefit or suffer the burden of) any
payment adjustments to contributions, or receipt of funds resulting from any
such activities that are related to the operation of the Business or the
ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets on or prior to the Closing Date
and as a result of this transaction, and in accordance with FCC rules and
regulations in effect at the Closing Date. Specifically, this paragraph shall
apply, but shall not be limited to, any matters related to USAC, the National
Exchange Carrier Association ("NECA") including the Universal Service Fund
("USF"), Long Term Support ("LTS"), Local Switching Support ("LSS"), Coalition
for Affordable Local and Long Distance Service ("CALLS") interstate access fund
and Telecommunications Relay Services funds established by the FCC.

                10.5.2  From and After Closing.

                        (a)   Upon Closing, Seller shall direct all appropriate
Persons that all payments discussed in Section 10.5.1 that relate to the
operation of the Business after the Closing Date with respect to the Study
Area(s) comprising the Seller Exchanges shall be paid to Buyer. In the event any
such Person fails to make such payment to Buyer and pays Seller, Seller shall
immediately deliver such funds to Buyer.

                        (b)   From and after Closing, the parties shall make
all data and other submissions required by FCC rules with respect to USF and
other high cost reimbursement programs. The parties shall cooperate and provide
any data or information related to the foregoing as may reasonably be requested
by the other party hereto.

     10.6       Access to Books and Records.

                10.6.1  Retention Period. After the Closing, Seller shall
retain all Retained Books and Records for a period of three (3) years, except
for Tax returns and supporting documentation which shall be retained until sixty
(60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and
Buyer shall retain all Transferred Books and Records for a period of five (5)
years.

                10.6.2  Access. After the Closing, upon reasonable notice and
subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the parties will give to the
representatives, employees, counsel and accountants of the other access, during
normal business hours, to books and records relating to the Business and the
Acquired Assets, and will permit such persons to examine and copy such records,
in each case to the extent reasonably requested by the other party in connection
with Tax and financial reporting matters (including appropriate portions of Tax
Returns and related information, but not attorney work product), audits, legal
proceedings, governmental investigations and other proper business purposes
(including such financial information and any receipts evidencing payment of
Taxes as may be requested by Seller to substantiate any claim for Tax credits or
refunds); provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall obligate any
party to take actions that would unreasonably disrupt the normal course of its
business or violate the terms of any agreement to which it is a party or to
which it or any of its assets is subject. Seller and Buyer will cooperate with
each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or similar proceedings involving or
otherwise relating to the Business (or the income therefrom or assets thereof)
with respect to any Tax, and each will execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 10.6.2.

     10.7       Purchase Price Allocation.

                (a)     Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide to Seller a draft Purchase Price allocation (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). Seller shall propose to Buyer any changes in the draft Purchase
Price Allocation within 30 days of the receipt thereof. In the event that no
such changes are proposed in writing to Buyer within such time, Seller shall be
deemed to have agreed to the Purchase Price Allocation. If any such changes are
proposed, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith and shall use their
reasonable efforts to agree upon the final Purchase Price Allocation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon a Purchase
Price Allocation, Seller and Buyer covenant and agree to file, and cause their
respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns consistent with each of Seller's
and Buyer's good faith allocations, unless otherwise required by law. For
purposes of this subsection 10.7(a), the Purchase Price Allocation shall be done
in a manner consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder.

                (b)     If Seller and Buyer reach an agreement on the Purchase
Price Allocation as provided above, Seller and Buyer agree to act in accordance
with such Purchase Price Allocation for all purposes, including for purposes of
any Tax Return. Except as otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or by a
Taxing authority pursuant to a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of
the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law) or the
execution of an IRS Form 870-AD, Seller and Buyer agree to report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation, and agree not to take any position on any Tax Return
inconsistent therewith, and to conduct any audit, Tax proceeding or Tax
litigation relating thereto in a manner consistent with such Purchase Price
Allocation.

                (c)     The Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted if the
Purchase Price is adjusted under any provision of this Agreement.

     10.8       Owned Real Property Transfers. Within ninety (90) days of the
date of this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer copies of all existing
title insurance policies covering the Owned Real Property. Thereafter, no later
than sixty (60) days before the estimated Closing Date, Seller shall deliver (at
its expense) to Buyer a preliminary title binder (on a standard form) issued by
a title insurance company reasonably acceptable to Buyer, solely with respect to
the Owned Real Property included in the Acquired Assets and in which Seller
purports to own fee title which (a) is presently used by Seller as a central
office facility, (b) is requested by Buyer as a requirement of any financing for
all or a significant part of the Purchase Price or (c) such other Owned Real
Property as expressly set forth on Schedule 10.8. To the extent Buyer requests
preliminary title binders for Owned Real Property in addition to the Owned Real
Property identified in subparts (a) and (b) of the preceding sentence, then
Seller and Buyer shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the costs and expenses
associated therewith. Such title binders shall be reasonably satisfactory to
counsel for Buyer, subject to the standard exceptions set forth in the following
sentence. Such title binders shall reflect that, upon consummation of the sale
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer will be vested with good, fee simple,
indefeasible and insurable title to such Owned Real Property, subject only to
Permitted Encumbrances. If a preliminary title binder indicates an exception
other than a Permitted Encumbrance, Seller shall, at its expense, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such exception to be removed on or
before the Closing Date. With respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property
covered by a preliminary title binder, the amount of title insurance provided by
Seller shall be the fair market value of the property, which shall be determined
by Buyer at its sole cost and expense using commercially reasonable methods of
valuation, provided that all such valuations shall be consistent with all
allocations of the Purchase Price made hereunder or pursuant to this Agreement.
Seller shall also deliver to Buyer (at Seller's expense and on or prior to the
Closing Date) a certified current survey. By no later than forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a final title insurance
policy paid for by Seller covering the Owned Real Property included in the
preliminary title binder.

     10.9       Transaction Taxes and Tax Refunds.

                (a)     Buyer shall bear and be responsible for paying any
sales, use, stamp, conveyance, transfer, documentary, registration, business and
occupation and other similar taxes (including related penalties additions to tax
and interest) imposed by any Governmental Authorities with respect to the
transfer of the Business and/or the Acquired Assets to Buyer (including the
Owned Real Property) ("Transaction Taxes"), regardless of whether the
Governmental Authority seeks to collect such taxes from Seller or Buyer. Buyer
shall also be responsible for (i) administering the payment of such Transaction
Taxes, (ii) defending or pursuing any proceedings related thereto, and (iii)
paying any expenses related thereto. Seller shall give prompt written notice to
Buyer of any proposed adjustment or assessment of any Transaction Taxes with
respect to the transaction, or of any examination of said transaction in a
sales, use, transfer or similar tax audit. In any proceedings, whether formal or
informal, Seller shall permit Buyer to participate and control the defense of
such proceeding, and shall take all actions and execute all documents required
to allow such participation. Seller shall not negotiate a settlement or
compromise of any Transaction Taxes without the written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                (b)     Buyer shall cooperate with all reasonable requests made
by Seller with respect to pursuing any Tax refund, including the filing of
refund claims and of amended Tax Returns.

     10.10      Bulk Sales Laws. Seller and Buyer waive compliance with
applicable Laws under any version of Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code
adopted by any state or any similar Law relating to the sale of inventory,
equipment or other assets in bulk in connection with the sale of the Acquired
Assets.

     10.11      Prepaid Non-Regulated Maintenance Agreements. Within thirty (30)
days following Closing, Seller shall provide reasonably detailed supporting
documentation related to and pay to Buyer an amount equal to the pro rata
portion of all prepaid but unearned revenues from Seller's customers for all
non-regulated maintenance agreements assumed by Buyer hereunder as of the
Closing Date.

     10.12      Vehicle Registration. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file promptly the appropriate vehicle title applications
and registrations to change the name of the titled owner on each vehicle title
certificate and change the motor vehicle registration (with respect to license
plate information) on each vehicle being transferred to Buyer from Seller
pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall remove and destroy Seller's existing
license plates from all vehicles received upon the later of receipt of new
license plates or ninety (90) days following Closing.

     10.13      CABS Accounts Receivable Transition. Seller shall render its own
final bills for minutes, messages and other applicable charges billable through
CABS for periods prior to and including the Closing Date. Seller shall be
responsible for collecting and settling any disputes associated with its final
CABS bills.

     10.14      CBSS and SSB Billing and Accounts Receivable Transition. Buyer
shall purchase Seller's CBSS Accounts Receivable and SSB Accounts Receivable and
make payment to Seller for those accounts in the manner described below.

                10.14.1 Transfer of Records. Seller shall transfer to Buyer,
as soon as reasonably available after Closing, all customer account records
related to CBSS and SSB as of the Closing Date. Following the Closing, Buyer
will be responsible for administering those records including the application of
cash receipts to customer accounts, whether related to services rendered before
or after the Closing, and submission of appropriate accounts to customary
collection treatment, including collection efforts by external collection
agents. Seller will promptly forward to Buyer the customer payments and related
remittance documents received by Seller with respect to such end-user customer
accounts after the Closing for processing by Buyer.

                10.14.2 Settlement of Accounts Receivable. Within twenty (20)
days following the Closing, Seller shall provide an accounting to Buyer of the
CBSS Accounts Receivable and SSB Accounts Receivable, the Customer Prepayments
and the resulting calculation of the CBSS Accounts Receivable Amount and SSB
Accounts Receivable Amount based on the CBSS Uncollectible Factor and the SSB
Uncollectible Factor respectively, which shall be summarized in an accounts
receivable settlement statement (the "Accounts Receivable Settlement
Statement"). Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, Buyer shall remit to
Seller an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate of the CBSS
Accounts Receivable Amount and SSB Accounts Receivable Amount less the full
amount of the Customer Prepayments. Within sixty (60) days following the
Closing, Buyer shall remit an additional fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate
of the CBSS Accounts Receivable Amount and SSB Accounts Receivable Amount and
within ninety (90) days will remit the final five percent (5%). In the event
Seller fails to deliver the Accounts Receivable Settlement Statement within the
time period set forth herein, Buyer shall be entitled to delay its payment
obligations pursuant to this Section 10.14 for the number of days equal to the
period of Seller's delay.

                10.14.3 Updated Statements. Not later than ten (10) days prior
to the due dates for the payments referred to in Section 10.14.2 above, Seller
shall provide Buyer with an updated Accounts Receivable Settlement Statement
reflecting any adjustments based upon non-sufficient funds checks, billing
adjustments or other facts that have become known after the original statement
that relate to pre-closing activity.

                10.14.4 Resolution of Material Discrepancies. If at any time
during the ninety (90) day period following the Closing, Buyer or Seller
discovers any material discrepancy in the Accounts Receivable Settlement
Statement, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any discrepancy in a timely manner, and further agree to make payments related
to any undisputed amounts as set forth above.

                10.14.5 Exclusive Remedies. The parties agree that the
provisions of this Section 10.14 set forth the sole and exclusive remedy for any
claim (whether such claim is framed in tort, contract or otherwise) regarding
the CBSS Accounts Receivable and SSB Accounts Receivable, and Buyer shall not be
entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to Article VII for a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein.

     10.15      Environmental Remediation. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.3.2(e), in the event that any Owned Real Property, Leased Real Property and/or
Real Estate Interests transferred by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
requires remediation (including as the result of regulatory action by any
Governmental Authority), either as the result of a claim made by Buyer pursuant
to Section 7.2 or as the result of a Retained Liability, then Seller shall
determine, in its discretion, the appropriate remedial activities (the
"Remediation Activities"), provided, that such Remediation Activities are in
compliance with any applicable Requirement of Law, and provided further, that
such Remediation Activities permit Buyer to use the affected property in a
manner consistent with Seller's use of such property as of the date hereof.
Buyer shall provide Seller and Seller's agents such access to the affected
property as Seller reasonably requests to perform the Remediation Activities.
Buyer shall sign any and all documents that Seller or its agents state are
reasonably necessary to carry out the Remediation Activities, provided that such
documents do not require Buyer to undertake additional obligations or
liabilities (other than those obligations or liabilities for which Seller agrees
to indemnify Buyer). Buyer shall not interfere with Seller's Remediation
Activities or Seller's efforts to gain the approval of any Governmental
Authority to perform such Remediation Activities in accordance with this
Agreement.

     10.16      Customer Deposits. Within thirty (30) days after Closing, Seller
shall transfer to Buyer the customer deposits together with any interest accrued
thereon (collectively, the "Customer Deposits") for the period ending on the
Closing Date, together with all of Seller's rights and obligations to hold the
Customer Deposits of the Business. Buyer shall hold and disburse such Customer
Deposits so delivered to it as if it were Seller.

     11.2       Good Faith Performance. Neither party shall be entitled to
exercise any right of termination pursuant to section 11.1 above if such party

result of the negligent or willful failure of Seller to perform any obligations
required to be performed by it hereunder on or prior to the date of termination.

                11.3.3  Termination by Seller. If this Agreement is terminated

permitted by Law, the parties hereby to the same extent waive any provision of
Law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any
respect.

     12.14      Schedules; Exhibits. Each Schedule and Exhibit delivered
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall constitute
a part of this Agreement, although schedules need not be attached to each copy
of this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in a Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Seller that
such item represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
Further, any fact or item which is clearly disclosed on any Schedule to this
Agreement or in the Financial Statements in such a way as to make its relevance
or applicability to information called for by another Schedule or other
Schedules to this Agreement reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be disclosed
on such other Schedule or Schedules, as the case may be, notwithstanding the
