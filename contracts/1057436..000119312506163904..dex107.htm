Hundred Forty Four Million Dollars ($344,000,000) of the Purchase Price is

Section 6.1 below), shall be payable in full at Closing in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available federal funds to a bank account designated
by Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation ("Title Company") in writing to

(1) business day prior to the date of Closing.

1.6 _Delivery to Title Company_. Upon mutual execution of this Agreement, the
parties shall deposit an executed copy of this Agreement with Title Company
and this Agreement shall (along with the escrow instructions described in
_Section 1.6_ and such supplementary instructions not inconsistent with this
Agreement as either party hereto may deliver to Title Company) serve as
escrow instructions to Title Company for the consummation of the purchase and
sale contemplated hereby. Seller and Purchaser agree to execute such
additional escrow instructions as Title Company may reasonably require and
which are not inconsistent with the provisions hereof; provided, however,
that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and
any supplementary escrow instructions, the terms of this Agreement shall
control.

1.7 _1031 Exchange_. If any party hereto elects (the "Electing Party") to
conduct a tax free exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code,
as amended, then the other party hereto agrees to cooperate (the "Cooperating
Party") with the Electing Party in conducting such tax free exchange under
such Section 1031 of the Code relating to this transaction. In the event of
such an election, the Electing Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the
Cooperating Party harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
causes of action, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and costs of litigation, that the Cooperating Party may suffer
or incur by reason of such exchange. Purchaser and Seller expressly reserve
the right to assign their rights, but not their obligations, hereunder to
a Qualified Intermediary as provided in IRC Reg. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) on or
before the Closing Date. Each Cooperating Party agrees to cooperate, but at no
cost, expense or risk to said Cooperating Party, and take any actions
reasonably requested by the Electing Party to cause such exchange to be
consummated and to qualify as a like kind exchange under such Section 1031 of
the Code, including, but not limited to, (a) permitting this Agreement to be
assigned to a Qualified Intermediary and (b) conveying the Property to, or at
the direction of, the Qualified Intermediary. In no event, however, shall any
such exchange extend, delay or otherwise adversely affect the Closing Date
(except as contemplated in Section 4.1, below). The provisions of this
Section shall survive the Closing. All references in this paragraph to tax-
free exchange under Section 1031 of the Code shall include "reverse exchanges"
as set forth in Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308..



 

3 ARTICLE II

_TITLE AND SURVEY_

2.1 _Title Examination; Commitment for Title Insurance_. Purchaser
has obtained from the Title Company an ALTA Commitment for Title Insurance
dated June 20, 2006 and issued under File No. 01550233 (the "Title
Commitment") covering the Property. Purchaser shall have until the close of
the Inspection Period (as defined below) to review the Title Commitment and
at Closing to obtain from the Title Company an owners policy of title
insurance in the full amount of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

2.2 _Survey_. The parties acknowledge that Seller has delivered to Purchaser
and the Title Company Sellers existing ALTA survey of the Property (the
"Survey"). Purchaser may, at its sole cost and expense, update and recertify
the Survey.

2.3 _Title Objections; Cure of Title Objections_. Purchaser acknowledges that
any item contained in the Title Commitment or any matter shown on the Survey
shall be deemed a Permitted Exception, provided that Seller agrees that, in
any event, all monetary liens (other than liens for bonds and special
assessments that are not yet due and payable) consisting of (A) any mortgage,
security agreement or other encumbrance granted by Seller or expressly assumed
by Seller, (B) any federal or state income tax liens against Seller, (C) any
judgment liens against Seller and (D) any inchoate mechanics liens arising
out of any work of improvement performed at Sellers request and not subject
to proration pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, shall be removed at
Sellers sole cost and expense on or prior to the Closing Date and shall not
be treated as Permitted Exceptions.

2.4 _Conveyance of Title_. At Closing, Seller shall convey and transfer to
Purchaser such title to the Property as will enable the Title Company to issue
to Purchaser an ALTA extended coverage owners policy of title insurance (the
"Title Policy") covering the Property, in the full amount of the Purchase
Price and in such form and with such endorsements as shall be agreed by
Purchaser and Title Company prior to expiration of the Inspection Period.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Property shall
be conveyed subject to the following matters, which shall be deemed to be
Permitted Exceptions:

(a) The terms of the Ground Lease;

(b) the rights of tenants, as tenant only, under the Leases;

(c) the lien of all ad valorem real estate taxes and assessments not yet due
and payable as of the date of Closing, subject to adjustment as herein
provided;

(d) local, state and federal laws, ordinances or governmental regulations,
including but not limited to, building and zoning laws, ordinances and
regulations, now or hereafter in effect relating to the Property; and

(e) items appearing of record or shown on the Survey, general and specific
plans and development permits, and, in either case, not objected to by
Purchaser or waived or deemed waived by Purchaser in accordance with 
_Sections 2.3_ or _2.5._



 

4 In connection with issuance of the Title Policy, Seller shall deliver to Title
Company customary certifications and affidavits to the Title Company,
including certifications and affidavits relating to the status of leases and
mechanics liens, but shall not be required to escrow any monies with the
Title Company in connection therewith. 

2.5 _Pre-Closing "Gap" Title Defects_. In the event that any matters of record
are not identified in the Title Commitment, the Survey or by Purchaser during
the Inspection Period or otherwise arise only following the close of the
Inspection Period ("Intervening Title Matters"), such matters shall be treated
as Permitted Title Exceptions for all purposes,  _unless_ Purchaser shall
have furnished a notice to Seller of an objection to such Intervening Title
Matters not later than the Closing Date setting forth the nature of the
Intervening Title Matter in reasonable detail. In the event Purchaser shall
so notify Seller of objections to Intervening Title Matters, Seller shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to cure such objections. Seller shall
notify Purchaser in writing prior to the earlier of (a) two business days
following receipt of Purchasers notice of any objection or (b) the Closing
whether Seller elects to attempt to cure such objections. If Seller elects to
attempt to cure, and provided that Purchaser shall not have terminated this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 3.2_, Seller shall have until the
Closing to attempt to remove, satisfy or cure the same and for this purpose
Seller shall be entitled to a reasonable adjournment of the Closing if
additional time is required, but in no event shall the adjournment exceed
thirty (30) days after the date for Closing set forth in _Section 4.1_. If
Seller elects not to cure any objections to Intervening Title Matters
specified in Purchasers notice, or if Seller is unable to effect a cure
prior to the Closing (or any date to which the Closing has been adjourned),
Purchaser shall have the following options: (i) to accept a conveyance of the
Property subject to the Permitted Exceptions, specifically including any
Intervening Title Matters objected to by Purchaser which Seller is unwilling
or unable to cure, and without reduction of the Purchase Price; or (ii) to
terminate this Agreement by sending written notice thereof to Seller, and
upon delivery of such notice of termination, this Agreement shall terminate
and thereafter neither party shall have any further rights, obligations or
liabilities hereunder except to the extent that any right, obligation or
liability set forth herein expressly survives termination of this Agreement.
If Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller does not intend to attempt to cure
any Intervening Title Matter objection; or if, having commenced attempts to
cure any objection, Seller later notifies Purchaser that Seller will be
unable to effect a cure thereof; Purchaser shall, prior to the Closing, notify
Seller in writing whether Purchaser shall elect to accept the conveyance under
clause (i) or to terminate this Agreement under clause (ii) of this _Section
2.3_. For the purposes of this _Section 2.5_, Seller shall be deemed to have
effected a cure of a title objection if the Title Company is willing fully to
insure over such matters by endorsement or otherwise, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser and without the payment of any premium or charge
other than premiums or charges Seller, in its discretion, shall undertake to
bear.

ARTICLE III

_INSPECTION PERIOD_

3.1 _Right of Inspection_. Prior to execution of this Agreement by Seller and
Purchaser, Seller granted to Purchaser, and Purchaser exercised, certain
rights of inspection and investigation of the Property. During such pre-
Agreement period Purchaser has had and following the execution of this
Agreement Purchaser shall have the continuing right to make a physical
inspection of the Property and to examine at such place or places at the
Property, in the offices of the Operator or elsewhere as the same may be
located, any operating files maintained



 

5 by Seller or Operator in connection with the ownership, operations, current
maintenance and management of the Property, including, without limitation,
the Ground Lease, Leases, lease files, Operating Agreements, the Licenses,
insurance policies, bills, invoices, receipts and other general records
relating to the income and expenses of the Property, correspondence, surveys,
plans and specifications, warranties for services and materials provided to
the Property, environmental audits and similar materials, but excluding
materials not directly related to the operations, current maintenance or
management of the Property such as, without limitation, Sellers internal
memoranda, financial projections, budgets (except as prepared for the Property
by Operator), appraisals, any information or software proprietary to Operator,
Sellers accounting and tax records and similar proprietary, elective or
confidential information, Purchaser understands and agrees that any on-site
inspections of the Property shall be conducted upon at least twenty-four (24)
hours prior written notice to Seller and in the presence of Seller or its
representative. Such physical inspection shall not unreasonably interfere with
the use of the Property by Seller or its tenants or Hotel guests nor shall
Purchasers inspection damage the Property in any respect. Such physical
inspection shall not be invasive in any respect (unless Purchaser obtains
Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), and
in any event shall be conducted in accordance with standards customarily
employed in the industry and in compliance with all governmental laws, rules
and regulations. Following each entry by Purchaser with respect to inspections
or tests on the Property, Purchaser shall restore the Property to a
condition which is as near to its original condition as existed prior to any
such inspections or tests. Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in its due
diligence but shall not be obligated to incur any liability or expense in
connection therewith. Purchaser shall not contact any tenants or guests of
the Property or any parties to the Contract Estoppels without obtaining
Sellers prior written consent, shall not disrupt Sellers or any tenants
activities on the Property and shall not conduct any interviews with
employees at the Hotel, without obtaining Sellers prior written consent,
other than the following members of the Hotels executive staff: the General
Manager and the Controller. Purchaser agrees to indemnify against and hold
Seller harmless from any claim for liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred) damages or injuries arising out
of or resulting from the inspection of the Property by Purchaser or
its agents, whether occurring prior to or following the Effective Date, but
which shall not include pre-existing conditions discovered by Purchaser during
such inspection. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
such obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Seller shall survive Closing
or any termination of this Agreement. All inspections shall occur at
reasonable times agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser.

3.2 _Right of Termination_. In the event Purchaser determines (such
determination to be made in Purchasers sole discretion) that the Property is
not suitable for its purposes, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to Seller at any time prior to
5 p.m. Phoenix time on June 26, 2006 (the "Inspection Period"). If
Purchaser fails to give Seller a notice of termination prior to the
expiration of the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall no longer have any right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 3.2_ and (subject to the
provisions of  _Section 2.5_) shall be bound to proceed to Closing and
consummate the transaction contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.



 

6 ARTICLE IV

_CLOSING_

4.1 _Time_. The Parties shall conduct an escrow closing (the "Closing") on
September 1, 2006, as the same may be extended to pursuant to _Section 2.3_
or _2.5_ (the "Closing Date") or such other earlier date as to which the
parties may agree. Seller may, by written notice to Buyer (the "Closing
Notice"), elect to either (a) accelerate the Closing Date by no more than ten
(10) days, or (b) extend the Closing Date by no more than ten (10) days. The
accelerated or extended Closing Date must be specified in the Closing Notice
and must be at least five (5) business days after the date on which the
Closing Notice is delivered to Purchaser. In the event the Closing does not
occur on or before the Closing Date, the Title Company shall, unless it is
notified by both Seller and Purchaser to the contrary within three (3)
business days after the Closing Date, return to the depositor thereof items
which were deposited thereunder; any such return shall not, however, relieve
either party of any liability it may have for its wrongful failure to close.
At Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall perform the obligations set forth in,
respectively, _Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.3_, the performance of which
obligations shall be concurrent conditions.

4.2 _Seller s Obligations at Closing_. Not less than two (2) business days
prior to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Title Company:

(a) a duly executed and notarized deed in the form of _Exhibit F-1_
(the "Deed"), conveying the Fee Component of the Land and Improvements,
subject only to the Permitted Exceptions;

(b) four (4) duly executed and notarized counterparts of an assignment and

rent and other sums payable after the Closing under the Leases shall be paid
as set forth in the notice;

(g) a certificate, dated as of the date of Closing and executed on behalf of
Seller by a duly authorized officer thereof, stating that the representations

all material respects as of the date of Closing (with appropriate
modifications of those representations and warranties made in  _Section 5.1_
to reflect any changes therein including without limitation any changes
resulting from actions under _Section 5.4_) or identifying any representation
or warranty which is not, or no



 

7 longer is, true and correct and explaining the state of facts giving rise to
the change. In no event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for, or be deemed
to be in default hereunder by reason of, any breach of representation or
warranty which results from any change that (i) occurs between the Effective
Date and the date of Closing and (ii) is expressly permitted under the terms
of this Agreement or is beyond the reasonable control of Seller to prevent;
provided, however, that the occurrence of a change which is not permitted
hereunder shall, if materially adverse to Purchaser, constitute the non-
fulfillment of the condition set forth in _Section 4.18(b)_. If, despite
changes or other matters described in such certificate, the Closing occurs,
Sellers representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall
be deemed to have been modified by all statements made in such certificate;

continued operation, leasing and maintenance of the Property which, at
Purchasers election, may be delivered outside of Escrow on the Closing Date;

Purchaser in the form of _Exhibit O_ ;

(o) four (4) duly executed counterparts of a written termination of that

(the "Current HMA");

(p) four (4) duly executed and notarized counterparts of the Residential
Expansion Parcel Agreement, in the form of _Exhibit R_ (the "Residential

(q) such additional documents as shall be reasonably required to consummate

At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser possession and occupancy of
the Property, subject to the New HMA and the other Permitted Exceptions.

preparation or litigation threatened or brought against Seller, by allowing
Seller and its agents or representatives access, upon reasonable advance
notice (which notice shall identify the nature of the information sought by
Seller), at all reasonable times to examine and make copies of any and all
instruments, files and records, which right shall survive the Closing.

4.3 _Purchaser s Obligations at Closing_. Not later than two (2) business
days prior to Closing (except as expressly set forth in subparagraphs (a) and
(b) below with respect to the Purchase Price and the Working Capital
Deposit), Purchaser shall deliver to Title Company:

decreased by prorations and adjustments as herein provided, in immediately
available wire transferred funds pursuant to _Section 1.5_;

(b) not later than 10:00 a.m. local time at the Property on the day of

following outside of the escrow conducted by the Title Company) shall:

(a) deliver to Seller (i) the full amount of the Purchase Price, as increased
or decreased by prorations and adjustments as herein provided and (ii) deliver

(b) record and file the Deed, the GL Assignment and the Residential Expansion

(f) deliver to Seller and Purchaser settlement statements prepared by Title
Company and approved by Seller and Purchaser not less than two (2) business

4.5 _Apportionments_. The following apportionments shall be made between
Seller and Purchaser as of 11:59 p.m. local time at the Property, on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Apportionment Date").

(a) Amounts paid or payable under the Leases, under any new leases executed
after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions hereof and under
all Operating Agreements. At the Closing, Seller shall either deliver to
Purchaser any security deposits actually held by Seller pursuant to the
Leases or credit to the account of Purchaser the amount of such security
deposits (to the extent such security deposits are not applied against
delinquent rentals or otherwise as provided in the Leases). Unpaid and
delinquent rent under the Leases collected by Seller or Purchaser after the
Closing Date shall be delivered as follows: (a) if Seller collects any unpaid
or delinquent rent for the Property, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser any
such rent relating to the date of Closing and any period thereafter within
fifteen (15) days after the receipt thereof, and (b) if Purchaser collects any
unpaid or delinquent rent from the Property, Purchaser shall deliver
to Seller any such rent relating to the period prior to the date of Closing
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt thereof. Seller and Purchaser agree
that all rent received by Seller or Purchaser after the date of Closing shall
be applied first to current rentals and then to delinquent rentals, if any,
in inverse order of maturity. Purchaser will make a good faith effort after
Closing to collect all rents in the usual course of Purchasers operation of
the Property, but Purchaser will not be obligated to institute any lawsuit or
other collection procedures to collect delinquent rents. With respect to
percentage rents based upon gross sales or other income generated by the
business of a tenant located on the Property during a specified period of
time (the "Applicable Period"), Purchaser shall, upon collection of such
percentage rent, remit to Seller an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the percentage rent so collected by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days which have elapsed in the Applicable Period prior
to the date of Closing and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Applicable Period. With respect to additional rent attributable
to insurance, taxes, common area maintenance and other operating expenses
which are passed through to tenants under the Lease (the "Pass Through
Expenses") which (i) have been billed by Seller to tenants prior to
Closing but which have not been collected or (ii) which have not been billed
to tenants by Seller prior to Closing and relate to periods prior to the
Closing and for which Purchaser bills subsequent to closing (Purchaser hereby
agreeing to so bill on Sellers behalf), Purchaser shall in accordance with
each such tenants lease and upon collection of same, remit to Seller an
amount equal to that portion of Pass Through Expenses which accrued prior to
Closing. If Seller has billed and collected Pass Through Expenses which
relate to periods after the Closing or if Seller



 

10 has collected and not expended monies for obligations as to Pass Through
Expenses as to which Purchaser would be liable or would be obligated to
refund to tenants, Seller shall credit the same to Purchaser at Closing. Any
Pass Through Expenses collected by Purchaser after the Closing shall be
applied as designated by the tenant and if the tenant does not
designate, first to current Pass Through Expenses and then to delinquent Pass
Through Expenses, if any, in the inverse order of maturity. Purchaser hereby
assumes responsibility for the payment of any unpaid leasing commissions and
tenant inducement costs with respect to any new Leases or Lease renewal or
modification approved (or deemed approved) by Purchaser pursuant to Section
5.4(c) below from and after the Effective Date. Seller shall be responsible
for payment of and shall credit Purchaser at Closing with any unpaid leasing
commissions and tenant inducement costs with respect to the current terms of
the Leases at the Property other than such approved new Leases or renewals or
modifications.

(b) Rental under the Ground Lease and payments due into the Basin Management
Fund (as defined in that certain Recreational Land Use Agreement dated June
10, 1985, by and between the United States acting through the Bureau of
Reclamation and the City of Scottsdale, Arizona, as amended, and applied to
the Hotel pursuant to the 3rd Amendment to the Ground Lease).

(c) Tour agents and travel agents commissions with respect to the Hotel.

(d) General real estate taxes, water or sewer rates and charges (if not
metered), personal property taxes, or any other governmental tax or charge
levied or assessed against the Property (collectively, the "Taxes"), relating
to the Property and payable during the year in which Closing occurs. If the
Closing shall occur before the actual Taxes payable during the year of Closing
are known, the apportionment of Taxes shall be upon the basis of the latest
available tax rates and assessed value of the Property, provided that, if the
Taxes for the year of Closing are thereafter determined to be more or less
than the Taxes for the preceding year (after any appeal of the assessed
valuation thereof is concluded), Seller and Purchaser promptly (but no later
than the date that is thirty (30) days from and after the date that the final
invoices for taxes for the Property for the year in which the Closing occurs
are issued by the applicable taxing authority, except in the case of an
ongoing tax protest) shall adjust the proration of such Taxes, and Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay to the other any amount required as a
result of such adjustment. Further, if Seller or Purchaser undertakes a tax
protest with respect to all or any portion of the Taxes for the year in which
Closing occurs or Seller does so with respect to any previous year, any refund
relating to any previous year shall be the property of Seller, and any refund
relating to the year in which Closing occurs shall be prorated as of the
Apportionment Date, subject in each case to payment of any of such refunds as
are due to Tenants under the Leases. All Taxes assessed for periods after the
date of Closing shall be paid by Purchaser.

(e) With respect to electricity, telephone, television, cable television, gas,
water and sewer services that are metered and other utilities (collectively,
the "Utilities"), Seller shall endeavor to have the respective companies
providing the Utilities read the meters for the Utilities on or immediately
prior to the Apportionment Date. Seller shall be responsible for all charges
based on such final meter reading, and Purchaser shall be responsible for all
charges thereafter. If such readings are not obtainable, then, until such time
as readings are obtained, charges for all Utilities for which readings were
not obtained shall be pro rated as of the Apportionment Date based upon the
per diem rate obtained by using the last period and bills for such Utilities
that are available. Upon the taking of a subsequent actual reading, such



 

11 apportionment shall be adjusted to reflect the actual per diem rate for the
billing period in which the date of Closing falls, and Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, shall promptly deliver to the other the amount determined
to be due upon such adjustment.

(f) Room charges, room service charges, valet, telephone and similar charges
as to the Hotel for the night commencing on the Apportionment Date and ending
on the morning of the date of Closing shall be apportioned fifty
percent (50%) to Seller and fifty percent (50%) to Purchaser. Dinner and bar
charges for the evening of the Apportionment Date shall be the property of
Seller. Breakfast charges for the morning of the date of Closing shall be the
property of Purchaser.

(g) Seller shall receive full reimbursement from Purchaser at Closing for each
of the following items:

(i) prepaid fees or other charges for transferable licenses, advertising
expenses (but only to the extent such expenses relate to advertising
reasonably useable by Purchaser), permits, telephone equipment, telephone
rental, or other items, if any, to the extent the rights to such prepaid fees
or other charges are assigned by Seller to Purchaser at Closing; and

(ii) transferable deposits with companies providing Utilities, if any, to the
extent the rights to such transferable deposits are assigned by Seller to
Purchaser at Closing.

(h) Amounts prepaid or payable under any Operating Agreements.

(i) Such other items as are customarily provided and adjusted in the sale of a
hotel (including, without limitation, promotional items and trade advertising
due bills to the extent such expenses relate to advertising reasonably useable
by Purchaser) shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser).

(j) The apportionments as to the Hotel in this _Section 4.5_ shall be
prepared, to the extent applicable, in accordance with the current edition of
the Uniform System of Accounts for Hotels of the Hotel Association of New
York City, Inc., as adopted by the American Hotel Association of the United
States and Canada.

4.6 _Inventories_. Purchaser shall acquire as of the Closing, as part of the
Property and without additional consideration, all inventories of Operating
Equipment and Operating Supplies (each as defined in the New HMA) at the
Property as of the Apportionment Date, excluding (a) all Unopened (as defined
below) cases of food and beverage inventory usable on or following the Closing
Date located on or used in connection with the Property as of the
Apportionment Date (excluding Unopened alcoholic beverages, all of which
shall be purchased by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.8_) and (b) goods and
merchandise owned by Seller or any Seller affiliate and used for retail sale
in the ordinary course of business in the retail portions of the health club
and recreation area or other retail concession operated within the Hotel
(provided that such inventory is usable for retail sales on or following the
Closing Date). All such inventory shall be separately paid for by Purchaser at
Closing at the lesser of Sellers cost or book value. During the night of the
Apportionment Date, and prior to the time scheduled for the commencement of
Closing on the date of Closing, representatives of both Seller and Purchaser
shall prepare an inventory of all



 

12 such Unopened food and beverage items and retail inventory, together with a
schedule identifying the unit cost of such items, as actually paid by Seller,
or the current value of such items held by Seller, as supported by the Books
for the Property. For the foregoing purposes and the purposes of Section 5.8
below, "Unopened" shall mean inventory which remains in unopened crates or
cases or which otherwise is stored in new or sealed condition (included,
without limitation, unopened bottles of alcoholic beverages) awaiting use in
any storage location at the Hotel and not in guest rooms, in service or held
for immediate service use at public bars or restaurants or otherwise
circulating for use in the Hotel. At Sellers request, Purchaser shall execute
and deliver to Seller at Closing a resale certificate, in the form required
for such purposes and customary in hotel purchase and sale transactions in
Arizona, confirming Purchasers intent to acquire items of Inventory held for
retail sale at the Hotel for the purposes of such retail sale.

4.7 _Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable_.

(a) As and when the same are received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay Seller
the full amount of all accounts receivable outstanding as of the date of
Closing owing from any present guests of the Hotel incurred during the pre-
Closing portion of that guests present stay, and room and related charges
for all guests of the Hotel for the night of the Apportionment Date shall be
apportioned as provided in _Section 4.5(e)_. Said accounts receivable are
hereinafter referred to as the "Included Accounts Receivable." Purchaser is
not purchasing any of the receivables of the Hotel, including, without
limitation, the Included Accounts Receivable. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in the collection of such accounts receivable (including, without
limitation, the Included Accounts Receivable), and for such purpose, Seller
shall be entitled to monitor and consult with Purchaser for a period of one
hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing regarding the status of and
procedure for collection of such accounts. Purchaser agrees to direct and
authorize the Hotels employees to cooperate with Sellers representative in
reviewing accounts receivable, and in answering any inquiries with respect
thereto. Purchaser further agrees to promptly remit to Seller any funds
received by it in payment of such accounts receivable. With regard to any
collection made from any person or entity who is indebted to the Hotel both
with respect to accounts receivable accruing prior to the Closing and to the
accounts receivable accruing subsequent to the Closing (other than Included
Accounts Receivable), such collection shall be applied as designated by the
payor, but if there is no designation, then any such collections received
within ninety (90) days after the Closing shall be applied first to the
indebtedness accrued subsequent to the Closing, but thereafter, any such
collections shall be applied first to the payment of any amounts due to
Purchaser on accounts accruing prior to the Closing.

(b) Purchaser shall be credited, at Closing, for any accounts payable
outstanding on the date of Closing, with respect to the operation of the Hotel
prior to Closing, except those accounts payable that are disputed by Seller.
Seller shall identify all such disputed accounts payable as provided in 
_Section 4.7(c)_ and shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless
against any liability arising out of any accounts payable dispute(s) so
identified by Seller. The accounts payable for which Purchaser is entitled to
a credit against the Purchase Price at Closing are hereinafter referred to as
the "Assumed Accounts Payable." In consideration of the credit against the
Purchase Price, Purchaser agrees to pay all Assumed Accounts Payable as and
when due and further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless
from and against any cost or liability resulting from nonpayment or late
payment of any of such Assumed Accounts Payable.



 

13 (c) During the night of the Apportionment Date, and prior to the time
scheduled for the commencement of the Closing on the Date of Closing,
Sellers representatives shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser or its
representatives a schedule detailing all Assumed Accounts Payable incurred
prior to the Apportionment Date.

4.8 _Cash; House Banks; Reserves_. The sale of the Hotel includes, without
additional consideration, the full amount of any funds unexpended in
the Replacement Reserve Account maintained under the Current HMA (which
reserve shall be accumulated, maintained and used in connection with the
Property in accordance with current practices and procedures, which shall be
consistent with the practices and procedures contemplated for the Replacement
Reserve Account established under the New HMA). The sale of the Hotel does not
include any deposits or reserves held by or pursuant to the requirements of
any lender under any Hotel financing or any other cash, checks and other
funds, including till money, house banks, and notes, securities and other
evidence of indebtedness held at the Hotel as of the Apportionment Date, nor
does it include balances on deposit to the credit of Seller or the Operator,
as Sellers agent under the Current HMA, with banking institutions
(collectively, the "House Banks") or any other funds, operating accounts or
reserves (excepting the Replacement Reserve Account) held by Seller, Operator
on behalf of Seller, or otherwise on Sellers behalf, and the same shall be
retained by Seller on the date of Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, till
money and other cash on hand in the Hotel only shall be counted as of 11:59
p.m. local time at the Property on the Apportionment Date, and Purchaser
shall retain such cash on hand (which shall be held and applied by Operator in
accordance with the New HMA) and Seller shall be credited with a like amount
at Closing.

4.9 _Reservation and Other Deposits_. On the date of Closing, the aggregate
amount of any Reservation Deposits or other advance payments and deposits
received by Seller (which shall be retained by Seller) shall be credited
against the Purchase Price for the benefit of Purchaser. Purchaser shall
execute a receipt for any Reservation Deposits or other advance payments and
deposits for which Purchaser receives a credit against the Purchase Price,
and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against all claims by,
and liabilities to, future guests or other persons or entities which have made
deposits pertaining to the application or return of the Reservation Deposits
or other advance payments and deposits for which Purchaser receives a credit
against the Purchase Price, in accordance with this _Section 4.9_.

4.10 _Safes and Baggage_. On the date of Closing, Seller shall cause the
delivery to Purchaser of all of Sellers keys to the safes in the Hotel. On
the date of Closing, Seller shall give written notices to those persons who
have deposited items in the safes, advising them of the sale of the Hotel to
Purchaser and requesting the removal or verification of their contents in the
safes. All such removals or verifications on the date of Closing shall be
under the supervision of Sellers and Purchasers respective representatives.
All contents that are to remain in the safes shall be recorded. Items
belonging to guests who have not responded to such written notice by so
removing and verifying their safe contents by the end of the date of Closing
shall be recorded in the presence of the respective representatives. Any such
contents so verified and recorded and thereafter remaining in the hands of
Purchaser shall be the responsibility of Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against any
liability therefor (except to the extent that Operator would bear liability
to Purchaser for such matters under the New HMA). Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any liability arising
from claims by guests for any loss of contents in the safe not recorded on the
date of Closing or based on damage occurring prior to the date of Closing



 

14 which is verified and recorded on the date of Closing. On the date of Closing,
representatives of Purchaser and Seller shall take an inventory of all
baggage, valises and trunks checked or left in the care of Seller. From and
after the date of Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for all baggage
listed in said inventory, and Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold Seller harmless from and against any liability therefor (except to
the extent that Operator would bear liability to Purchaser for such matters
under the New HMA). Seller shall remain liable for any acts or omissions with
respect to such baggage which occurred prior to the date of Closing as well
as for claimed omissions from said inventory, and Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any liability therefor.

4.11 _Employees; 401(k) Plan_.

(a) Seller shall, at Sellers election (subject to applicable legal
requirements), pay or credit Purchaser at Closing for any "Compensation"
accrued and unpaid prior to the date of Closing with respect to Hotel
Employees (defined in  _Section 5.9_) prior to Closing. As used herein,
"Compensation" shall mean the direct salaries and wages and other aggregate
compensation paid to or accrued for the benefit of any employee together with
all fringe benefits payable to or accrued for the benefit of such employee as
to which the employer is responsible, including, without limitation, employer
contributions under F.I.C.A., fringe benefits, annual bonuses, unemployment
compensation or other employment taxes, pension fund contributions, vacation
pay, sick leave, workers compensation, group life and accidental and health
premiums, and pension or profit sharing, retirement, disability and other
similar benefits. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay (i) all
Compensation with respect to the operations of the Property on and after the
date of Closing and (ii) all Compensation which is accrued but not payable as
of the Closing and for which Purchaser is credited at Closing. For these
purposes, vacation benefits, sick leave, annual bonuses and related payroll
expenses of Hotel Employees (the "Supplemental Employee Expenses") as of the
Closing shall be treated as accrued and subject to proration solely (A) if
vested and _not_ subject to expiration if not used or termination in the event
of the employees departure or (B) to the extent of 70% of any such accrued
Supplemental Employee Expenses subject to later vesting or expiration if not
used or termination in the event of the employees departure. With respect to
accrued bonuses for 2006, Sellers pro-rated share at Closing shall be based
upon Operators reasonable estimate of the bonuses to be paid to such Hotel
Employees for 2006. No later than March 31, 2007, or earlier upon the mutual
agreement of the parties, the parties shall adjust Sellers pro-rated share of
the bonuses paid to the Hotel Employees for 2006 based upon the actual
amounts of such bonuses (as shown by such supporting documentation as may be
reasonably required by either party), and Purchaser or Seller, as the case may
be, shall make such additional payment or refund as shall be required by
such adjustment. Purchaser acknowledges that the New HMA shall initially
afford the Hotel Employees continuation of all rights under Operators
existing Section 401(k) plans and health care plans, as previously afforded
under the Current HMA. 

4.12 _Property Not Included In Sale_. The following shall not be included in
the Property to be sold hereunder: Tax deposits, utility deposits and other
deposits, except for transferable utility deposits, which are to be
apportioned as herein provided, and except for Reservation Deposits which are
credited against the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 4.9_. 

4.13 _Settlement of Apportionments_. If the computation of the apportionments
and adjustments described in this _Section 4_ shows that a net amount is
owed by Seller to Purchaser,



 

15 such amount shall be credited against the Purchase Price as provided for in
_Section 1.5_. If such computation shows that a net amount is owed by
Purchaser to Seller, such amount shall be paid by wire transfer to Seller by
Purchaser on the Closing Date in addition to the payment of the cash portion
of the Purchase Price to be made by Purchaser under  _Section 1.5_.

4.14 _Closing Costs_. Seller shall pay: (a) the fees of any counsel

4.16 _Capital Programs_.

Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that Operator is currently engaged in certain
material programs of Capital Improvements at the Hotel approved by Seller in
the Annual Budget for the Hotel for 2006 and enumerated on the 2006 Capital
Status Report set forth as _Exhibit S_ to this Agreement under the captions
"Approvals" (collectively, the "Capital Programs") and
contemplating aggregate expenditures on account of such Capital Programs in
the aggregate amount of $3,878,000 (the "Approved Cap Ex Amount"). Of such
aggregate amount, the Capital Programs identified as the "2005 Carryover
Projects" on  _Exhibit S_ are estimated to cost an aggregate of $1,725,000
and the other Capital Programs contemplated for 2006 on _Exhibit S_ are
estimated to cost an aggregate of $2,153,000. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees to be bound by Sellers approval of the scope of all of the Capital
Programs and to complete such Capital Programs in accordance with the HMA,
provided that Purchaser and Seller have agreed as follows:

(a) Seller shall be debited and Purchaser shall be credited at Closing with
the amount, if any, by which Sellers aggregate expenditures on Capital
Programs in 2006 are less than the aggregate Approved Cap Ex Amount forecast
on _Exhibit S_ to have been expended on the Capital Programs in 2006. If,
however, Seller has expended more than the Approved Cap Ex Amount on the
Capital Programs as of the Closing Date, Seller shall receive a credit and
Purchaser shall be debited with the amount of such excess expended by Seller.

(b) Purchaser shall assume the obligations under the HMA for the payment of
costs of the Capital Programs not paid as of the Closing Date, with any cost
savings or cost overruns following the Closing Date solely for the account of
Purchaser. Purchaser



 

16 shall fund at Closing into the Hotels Accounts the full amount of the credit
afforded Purchaser pursuant to this Section (or such lesser amount as Seller
and Operator shall approve as necessary to ensure the uninterrupted progress
to conclusion of the Capital Programs and the payment in full and timely
fashion following the Closing Date of all progress and other payments due
under for the conduct of the Capital Programs).

(c) Seller shall not approve (and shall ensure that Operator shall not
commence or commit to) any of the Capital Improvements at the Hotel enumerated
on the 2006 Capital Status Report set forth as _Exhibit S_ to this Agreement
which are _not_ identified under the captions "Approvals" (i.e. are not
Capital Programs) without Purchasers prior written consent. In addition,
Seller shall not approve or commit to (and shall ensure that Operator shall
not commit to) any expenditures with respect to the Capital Programs in
excess of the amounts budgeted for such Capital Programs on _Exhibit S_ ,
without Purchasers prior written consent.

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that the Approved Cap Ex Amount and the monthly
forecasts of expenditures on account of the Capital Programs are but estimates
and that neither Seller nor Operator has expressed any representation or
warranty with respect to either the cost or the time required to conduct or
complete the approved Capital Programs.

4.17  _Post-Closing Adjustments and Collections_. Concurrently with the

closing statement to be prepared reflecting their respective closing costs,
the apportionments, the payment of the Purchase Price and all other terms of
this Agreement affecting or relating to the amount of and adjustments to the
consideration to be paid for the Property. In the event either Purchaser or
Seller becomes aware of any item in the closing statement which requires
adjustment as a result of new information or the ascertainment of actual
amounts for items which are the subject of estimates at Closing, it shall
promptly advise the other in writing and provide such
supporting documentation as shall reasonably be required. Upon the ninetieth
(90th) day following the date of Closing, or earlier upon mutual agreement of
the parties, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall make such
additional payment or refund as shall be required by the aggregate of any
such post-Closing adjustments, including, without limitation, the adjustments
resulting from collection of accounts receivable that are not Included
Accounts Receivable and a final closing statement shall be prepared to
reflect such revisions, subject only to subsequent adjustments provided for in
_Section 4.5_. This provision shall not merge with the grant deed delivered
hereunder but shall survive Closing.

4.18 _Conditions Precedent to Obligation of Purchaser_. The obligation of
Purchaser to consummate the transaction hereunder shall be subject to
the fulfillment on or before the date of Closing of all of the following
conditions, any or all of which may be waived by Purchaser in its sole

exercise.

of which may be waived by Seller in its sole discretion:

payable in the manner provided for in this Agreement.

In the event any of the conditions set forth in Sections 4.18 or 4.19 are not
fulfilled or waived, the party benefited by such condition may, by
written notice to the other party, terminate this Agreement, whereupon all
rights and obligations hereunder of each party shall be at an end. No such
termination shall relieve either party of any obligations or liabilities
arising as a consequence of a breach or default under this Agreement or in
respect of any claim under any indemnification provision set forth in this
Agreement. Purchaser and Seller may, at their election, at any time or times
on or before the date specified for the satisfaction of the condition, waive
in writing the benefit of any of the conditions set forth, respectively, in
Sections 4.18 or 4.19. In the event this Agreement is terminated as a result
of the failure of any condition set forth in Sections 4.18 or 4.19 (or as a
result of any other event giving rise to a right on the part of Purchaser to
terminate this Agreement), Seller shall within one business day direct Title



 

18 Company to return the full amount of the Deposit to Purchaser. In addition, if
for any reason, this Agreement is terminated based upon the failure of either
or both of the conditions set forth in Sections 4.18(e) or 4.19(e), Seller
shall pay to Purchaser within five (5) business days following such
termination an additional amount equal to (a) One Million Dollars

imputation or otherwise, to refer to the



 

21 knowledge of Seller, or any affiliate of Seller, to Operator, or to any other
officer, agent, manager, representative or employee of Seller or any
affiliate thereof or to impose upon such Designated Employees any duty to
investigate the matter to which such actual knowledge, or the absence thereof,
pertains. As used herein, the term "Designated Employees" shall refer to the
following persons: Sara Schultz (whom Seller represents is the most
knowledgeable individual in Sellers corporate offices with respect to the
operations of the Property pursuant to her duties as asset manager in the
ordinary course of business), Thomas Griffiths and Michael Glennie.

5.3 _Survival of Seller s Representations and Warranties_. 

The representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Section 5.1_, as
updated by the certificate of Seller to be delivered to Purchaser at Closing
in accordance with _Section 4.2(f)_, shall survive Closing for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days (excepting Section 5.1(a), which shall have no
such limitation)(the "Limitation Period"). No claim for a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller shall be actionable or payable (a) if the
breach in question results from or is based on a condition, state of facts or
other matter which was known to Purchaser prior to Closing, (b) unless the
valid claims for all such breaches collectively aggregate more than Three
Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($375,000)in which event the full amount
of such claims shall be actionable, and (c) unless written notice containing
a description of the specific nature of such breach shall have been given by
Purchaser to Seller prior to the expiration of the Limitation Period and an
action shall have been commenced by Purchaser against Seller within
ninety (90) days after the termination of the survival period provided for
above in this _Section 5.3_. Purchaser agrees to first seek recovery under
any insurance policies or service contracts prior to seeking recovery from
Seller (other than commencement of an action to preserve Purchasers rights
under this _Section 5.3_), and Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser if
Purchasers claim is satisfied from such insurance policies or service
contracts. As used herein, the term "Cap" shall mean the total aggregate
amount of Eight Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($8,250,000). In no
event shall Sellers aggregate liability to Purchaser for breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement or the certificate to
be delivered by Seller at Closing pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_ hereof exceed
the amount of the Cap. Any written disclosure delivered to Purchaser by Seller
or any other entity prior to the end of the Inspection Period, and any fact
or matter which is within the actual knowledge of Purchaser (which as used
herein shall mean only the actual knowledge of Stephen K. Miller or Cory
Warning) shall constitute notice to Purchaser of the fact or matter so
disclosed or actually known, as applicable, and Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived any claim against Seller on account of any inconsistency between
such fact or matter and any of the foregoing representations and warranties
if Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the
Inspection Period. In addition, any written disclosure delivered to Purchaser
by Seller or any other entity or any matter actually known to Purchaser
following the expiration of the Inspection Period and prior to the Closing
which is materially inconsistent with any of the foregoing representations and
warranties shall constitute notice to Purchaser of the matters disclosed, and
Seller shall have no further liability on account of any such inconsistencies
if Purchaser waives such matter in writing and consummates the transaction
contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, any disclosure by
Seller of any matter made in any of the Schedules or Exhibits to
this Agreement shall be deemed a disclosure of such matter in each and every
Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement. In the event that, prior to the
Closing, Purchaser obtains actual knowledge of any information which indicates
that any of the representations and warranties (including any of the matters
disclosed in any of the Schedules or Exhibits hereto) are untrue, Purchaser
shall promptly advise Seller in writing of such information. Purchaser shall
be



 

22 deemed to have waived the inaccuracy of any such representation and warranty
to the extent Purchaser fails to notify Seller of Purchasers disapproval of
such information pursuant to the preceding sentence and thereafter consummates
the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event Purchaser waives in writing
any representation or warranty, then Seller shall have no liability under
this Agreement for such representation or warranty to the extent waived.

(b) CP Hotels (U.S.) 1998 Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CP1998") hereby
undertakes and agrees that CP1998 shall be jointly and severally liable with
Seller to Purchaser for any payment obligations and other liabilities of
Seller under this Agreement arising or payable following the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, obligations and liabilities arising under
Section 4.5, Sections 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 or any of the documents delivered on
the Closing Date and attached as exhibits to this Agreement, provided that
(i) such liability shall be subject to all of the limitations applicable to
Sellers liabilities set forth in this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall
such liability of CP1998 survive with respect to any of Purchasers claims
not made prior to the expiration of the Limitation Period.

5.4 _Covenants of Seller_. Seller hereby covenants with Purchaser as follows:

this Agreement, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to operate and maintain
the Property in a manner generally consistent with the manner in which Seller

prior written consent of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) Seller shall not enter into, amend or terminate any Operating
Agreement or the Casualty Policies, remove any material amount of the Personal
Property other than in the ordinary course of business and without replacing
the same if so required in the ordinary course of business nor allow the
Casualty Policies to expire or lapse for nonpayment of premiums.

(b) Seller shall use its good faith, commercially reasonable efforts (but
without obligation to incur any cost or expense) to obtain and deliver to
Purchaser prior to the Closing Date a written estoppel in the form of _Exhibit
N-1_  (with such modifications on which Purchaser and Seller reasonably may
agree) (the "Ground Lease Estoppel") signed by the City of Scottsdale as the
landlord under the Ground Lease. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to
the contrary, Sellers inability to obtain the Ground Lease Estoppel shall
not constitute a default by Seller, but delivery of the Ground Lease Estoppel
shall be a condition to Purchasers obligation to close hereunder. To the
extent that any matters as to which Seller has made a representation or
warranty herein are encompassed within the Ground Lease Estoppel, such
representation or warranty shall no longer be effective and Purchaser shall
have no rights in connection therewith.

(c) Seller shall use its good faith, commercially reasonable efforts (but
without obligation to incur any cost or expense) to obtain and deliver
to Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, written
estoppel certificates (i) in the form of _Exhibit N-2_ (or as otherwise may be
specified in any Lease or with such modifications on which Purchaser and
Seller reasonably may agree) (each a "Tenant Estoppel") signed by each of the
tenants under any Leases; and (ii) in the form on which Purchaser and Seller
reasonably may agree (each a "Contract Estoppel") signed by any party to any
material covenants, conditions and agreements affecting the Property or
agreements affording the Property use and access rights to any off-site
facilities material to the operations of the Hotel. Notwithstanding anything
herein contained to



 

23 the contrary, Sellers inability to obtain any Tenant Estoppel or Contract
Estoppel shall not constitute a default by Seller hereunder nor shall
delivery of all Tenant Estoppels or Contract Estoppels be a condition to
Purchasers obligation to close hereunder. To the extent that any matters as
to which Seller has made a representation or warranty herein are encompassed
within any Tenant Estoppel or Contract Estoppel, such representation or
warranty shall no longer be effective and Purchaser shall have no rights in
connection therewith.

(d) Seller shall use its good faith, commercially reasonable efforts (but
without obligation to incur any cost or expense) to obtain and deliver
to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date a written estoppel in a form
reasonably requested by Purchaser (with such modifications on which Purchaser
and Seller reasonably may agree) (the "PGA Golf Use Estoppel") signed by the
PGA Tour, Inc. with respect to the Golf Use Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, Sellers inability to obtain the
PGA Golf Use Estoppel shall not constitute a default by Seller hereunder, nor
shall delivery of the Golf Use Estoppel be a condition to Purchasers
obligation to close hereunder. To the extent that any matters as to which
Seller has made a representation or warranty herein are encompassed within the
PGA Golf Use Estoppel, such representation or warranty shall no longer be
effective and Purchaser shall have no rights in connection therewith.

(e) Seller shall use its good faith, commercially reasonable efforts (but
without obligation to incur any cost or expense) to obtain and deliver to
Purchaser prior to the Closing Date a written estoppel in a form reasonably
requested by Purchaser (with such modifications on which Purchaser and Seller
reasonably may agree) (the "Tournament Golf Use Estoppel") signed by the
Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale, Inc. with respect to the Golf Use
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary,
Sellers inability to obtain the Tournament Golf Use Estoppel shall not
constitute a default by Seller hereunder, nor shall delivery of the Tournament
Golf Use Estoppel be a condition to Purchasers obligation to close hereunder.
To the extent that any matters as to which Seller has made a representation
or warranty herein are encompassed within the Tournament Golf Use Estoppel,
such representation or warranty shall no longer be effective and Purchaser
shall have no rights in connection therewith 

(f) A copy of any new lease or renewal or modification of any Lease which
Seller wishes to execute between the Effective Date and the date of Closing
will be submitted to Purchaser for its approval prior to execution by Seller.
Purchaser agrees to notify Seller in writing within ten (10) days after its
receipt thereof of either its approval or disapproval, including all
tenant inducement costs and leasing commissions to be incurred in connection
therewith. Purchasers approval of any new lease, renewal or modification
shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event Purchaser fails to notify
Seller in writing of its approval or disapproval within the ten (10) day time
period for such purpose set forth above, such failure shall be deemed the
approval by Purchaser. At Closing, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any
tenant inducement costs, leasing commissions or other expenses, including
legal fees, incurred by Seller pursuant to a new Lease or a renewal or a
modification approved (or deemed approved) by Purchaser.

(g) Seller shall cause the Current HMA to be terminated as of the Closing
Date.



 

24 (h) Seller shall have the right to make and accept Reservations for use of the
Hotels rooms, banquet and restaurant facilities and meeting and convention
facilities (and accept cancellations of such Reservations) in the ordinary
course of business at Operators customary rates and charges and Purchaser
agrees to honor and assume all such Reservations following Closing.

(i) Seller acknowledges that as an affiliate of a public company Purchaser
will require audited financial statements relating to the Hotel for the three
(3) full calendar years prior to the Closing Date. Seller will use its
commercially reasonable efforts, at no cost or liability to Seller, to request
the accountants that prepared such audited financial statements to permit
Purchaser and its affiliates to rely on such audits to the extent necessary
for Purchasers affiliate to comply with its obligations as a public company.
The covenant in the preceding sentence shall survive the Closing; provided,
however, that the failure of the accountants affirmatively to permit Purchaser
or its affiliates to rely on such audits shall not constitute a default of
Seller hereunder, nor shall the granting of such permission by the
accountants be a condition to Purchasers obligation to close hereunder.

5.5 _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_. Purchaser hereby
represents and warrants to Seller:

(a) Purchaser has the full right, power and authority to purchase the Property
as provided in this Agreement and to carry out Purchasers obligations
hereunder, and all requisite action necessary to authorize Purchaser to enter
into this Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder have been, or
by the Closing will have been, taken. The person signing this Agreement on
behalf of Purchaser is authorized to do so.

(b) There is no action, suit, arbitration, unsatisfied order or judgment,
government investigation or proceeding pending against Purchaser which, if
adversely determined, could individually or in the aggregate materially
interfere with the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

full responsibility for such inspections and irrevocably waives any claim
against Seller arising from the presence of hazardous substances on the
Property. Purchaser shall also furnish to Seller copies of any other reports
received by Purchaser relating to any other inspections of the Property
conducted on Purchasers behalf, if any (including, specifically, without
limitation, any reports analyzing compliance of the Property with the

_et_ _seq_., if applicable).

5.8 _Alcoholic Beverage Licenses_. An affiliate of Operator, CP Hotels (U.S.)
1998 Inc., currently holds those licenses permitting the purchase, storage and
sale of alcoholic



 

25 beverages at the Property which are listed on _Exhibit E_ (the "Liquor
Licenses") and shall continue to hold the Liquor Licenses as a nominee for
such purposes of the Operator in accordance with the New HMA. Purchaser shall
be required to purchase from Seller at the Closing, at the lesser of Sellers
cost or book value, the Unopened liquor inventory for the Hotel owned by
Seller.

5.9 _Employee and Related Matters_. Purchaser hereby covenants with Seller as
follows: 

(a) Pursuant to the Current HMA, all employees and staff at the Hotel are
currently employees of Seller. As of the Closing, all persons employed by
Seller at the Hotel immediately prior to the Closing Date ("Hotel Employees"),
at Sellers election (an "Employer Election") shall be (i) retained by Seller,
who shall serve as the "Employment Affiliate" under the New HMA following the
Closing Date or (ii) terminated, but offered "employment on substantially
equivalent terms and conditions" for a period of at least ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date by another affiliate of Operator acting as the
Employment Affiliate. As used herein, the phrase "employment on substantially
equivalent terms and conditions" shall include recognition of the accrued
vacation balances (subject to the credits to Purchaser under the provisions
of Section 4.11). Purchaser acknowledges that the Employment Affiliate shall
initially afford the Hotel Employees continuation of all rights under the
Hotel Employees existing Section 401(k) plans and health care plans, as
required under the New HMA and otherwise shall be managed pursuant to the
terms of the New HMA. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate (and Seller shall
cause Operator to cooperate) in such transition and all communications with
the Hotel Employees about the termination and rehiring process to avoid any
disruption in Hotel operations and to diminish employee concerns and any
misinformation regarding the transfer of the employer function.

(b) Purchaser, through the payment of such costs as "Employee Expenses" under
the New HMA, shall be responsible for all wages and benefits for Hotel
employees who remain employed or accept employment with the Employment
Affiliate as provided herein and pursuant to the "Owners" obligations under
the HMA (x) arising or accruing on and after the date of Closing or (y)
arising or accruing under the New HMA or otherwise arising as a matter of law
for which Purchaser receives proration credit pursuant to this Agreement.
Purchaser shall also be responsible for any "pay in lieu of notice",
that Seller or Operator must pay to Hotel Employees to the extent such "pay
in lieu of notice" is provided because of "employment loss" of Hotel Employees
under the provisions of the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act
(29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq.) (the "WARN Act"), except to the extent that
such payments are required based on Sellers failure to retain or offer
employment to all Hotel Employees as required pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii)
above. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and
against any and all amounts that Seller is required to pay to Hotel Employees
as a result of the imposition of liability under the provisions of the WARN
Act in connection with this transaction, except to the extent that such
liability arises based on Sellers failure to retain or offer employment to
all Hotel Employees pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above. Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with respect to the timing and form of any notices
required to be provided to Hotel Employees or governmental authorities
regarding the sale of the Property.

(c) This subsection shall survive the Closing.



 

26 ARTICLE VI

_DEFAULT_

6.1 _Deposit and Default by Purchaser_.

Within one business day after the full execution of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall deliver to Title Company for deposit into the escrow, the sum
of EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ($18,000,000) (together with any interest accrued
thereon, the "Deposit"). No provision of this Agreement shall be binding upon
Seller unless and until Title Company shall have received the Deposit. If
this transaction is consummated as contemplated by this Agreement, then the
entire amount of the Deposit shall be paid to Seller and credited against the
Purchase Price. The entire amount of the Deposit shall be returned immediately
to Purchaser in the event of the failure of any of the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 4.17 above or if Purchaser shall otherwise be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof (including, without
limitation, due to a default by Seller). IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH BY
PURCHASER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE
DEPOSIT SHALL BE RETAINED BY SELLER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. PURCHASER AND
SELLER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SELLERS DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF
SUCH A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY PURCHASER WOULD BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE
TO DETERMINE, THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS THE PARTIES BEST AND MOST
ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES SELLER WOULD SUFFER IN THE EVENT
THE TRANSACTION PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS TO CLOSE, AND THAT SUCH
ESTIMATE IS REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF THIS
AGREEMENT. PURCHASER AND SELLER AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR SELLERS RIGHT TO
ENFORCE THE SURVIVING COVENANTS AND INDEMNITIES OF PURCHASER CONTAINED IN
SECTIONS 1.7 AND 3.1 AND ARTICLE X, SELLERS RIGHT TO RETAIN THE DEPOSIT SHALL
BE THE SOLE REMEDY OF SELLER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF
THIS AGREEMENT BY PURCHASER. 

ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:

______ ______ 

Purchaser Seller

6.2 _Default by Seller_. If Seller fails to consummate this Agreement for any
reason other than Purchasers default or the permitted termination of this
Agreement by Seller or Purchaser as herein expressly provided, Purchaser shall
be entitled, as its sole remedy, either (a) to terminate this Agreement and
release Seller from any and all liability hereunder (provided, however, in a
case where Seller shall willfully default on its obligations hereunder, Seller
shall also pay to Purchaser a sum equal to Purchasers reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, not to exceed the sum of Three Hundred Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars ($375,000) or (b) to enforce specific performance of Sellers
obligation to execute the documents required to convey the Property to
Purchaser, it being understood and agreed that the remedy of specific
performance shall not be available to enforce any other obligation of Seller
hereunder. Purchaser expressly waives its rights to seek damages in the event
of Sellers default hereunder. Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to



 

27 terminate this Agreement if Purchaser fails to file suit for specific
performance against Seller in a court having jurisdiction in the county and
state in which the Property is located, on or before fifteen (15) days
following the date upon which Closing was to have occurred. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.2_, in the event that Sellers
Actionable Conduct (as defined below) shall cause the remedy of specific
performance to be unavailable to Purchaser, then in addition to the remedies
set forth above in this _Section 6.2_, Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
Purchasers actual (but not consequential or punitive) damages resulting from
Sellers default, provided that Purchaser shall file suit for such damages on
or before fifteen (15) days following the date upon which Closing was to have
occurred. "Sellers Actionable Conduct" shall mean Sellers sale of the
Property to a third party bona fide purchaser, or Sellers willful creation of
a defect in title which would prevent Seller from being able to convey the
Property to Purchaser as required by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

_RISK OF LOSS_

7.1 _Minor Damage_. In the event of loss or damage to the Property or any
portion thereof which is not "major" (as defined below in _Section 7.3_),
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect provided Seller assigns
to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest to any claims and
proceeds Seller may have with respect to any Casualty Policy or condemnation
awards relating to the premises in question. If Seller so assigns a casualty
claim to Purchaser, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the deductible amount under the applicable Casualty Policy. Upon Closing, full
risk of loss with respect to the Property shall pass to Purchaser.

7.2 _Major Damage_. In the event of a "major" loss or damage, either Seller or
Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party.
If neither Seller nor Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement within ten
(10) days after Seller sends Purchaser written notice of the occurrence of
major loss or damage, then Seller and Purchaser shall be deemed to
have elected to proceed with Closing, in which event Seller shall assign to
Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest to any claims and proceeds
Seller may have with respect to any Casualty Policy (including, without
limitation, proceeds of business interruption insurance) or condemnation
awards relating to the premises in question. If Seller so assigns a casualty
claim to Purchaser, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the deductible amount under the applicable Casualty Policy. Upon Closing,
full risk of loss with respect to the Property shall pass to Purchaser.

7.3 _Definition of "Major" Loss or Damage_. For purposes of _Sections 7.1_
and _7.2_ , "major" loss or damage refers to the following: (a) loss or damage
to the Property or any portion thereof such that the cost of repairing or
restoring the premises in question to a condition substantially identical to
that of the premises in question prior to the event of damage would be, in the
opinion of an architect selected by Seller and reasonably approved by
Purchaser, equal to or greater than Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000),
and (ii) any loss due to a condemnation which permanently and materially
impairs the current use of the Property. If Purchaser does not give notice to
Seller of Purchasers reasons for disapproving an architect within five (5)
days after receipt of notice of the proposed architect, Purchaser shall be
deemed to have approved the architect selected by Seller.



 

28 ARTICLE VIII

_COMMISSIONS_

8.1 _Brokerage Commissions_. Each party agrees that should any claim be made
for brokerage commissions or finders fees by any broker or finder by, through
or on account of any acts of said party or its representatives, said party
will indemnify and hold the other party free and harmless from and against any
and all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense in connection therewith.
The provisions of this paragraph shall survive Closing or earlier termination
of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

_DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS_

9.1 _No Reliance on Documents_. Except as expressly stated herein, Seller
makes no representation or warranty as to the truth, accuracy or completeness
of any materials, data or information delivered by Seller to Purchaser in
connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that all materials, data and information delivered by Seller to
Purchaser in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby are provided
to Purchaser as a convenience only and that any reliance on or use of such
materials, data or information by Purchaser shall be at the sole risk of
Purchaser, except as otherwise expressly stated herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing provisions, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
(a) any environmental or other report with respect to the Property which is
delivered by Seller to Purchaser shall be for general informational purposes
only, (b) Purchaser shall not have any right to rely on any such report
delivered by Seller to Purchaser, but rather will rely on its own inspections
and investigations of the Property and any reports commissioned by Purchaser
with respect thereto, and (c) neither Seller, any affiliate of Seller nor the
person or entity which prepared any such report delivered by Seller to
Purchaser shall have any liability to Purchaser for any inaccuracy in or
omission from any such report or in verbal communication.

9.2 _Disclaimers_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, IT IS
UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT SELLER IS NOT MAKING AND HAS NOT AT ANY TIME MADE
ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AS TO HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE (OTHER THAN SELLERS LIMITED WARRANTY OF TITLE
TO BE SET FORTH IN THE DEED), ZONING, TAX CONSEQUENCES, LATENT OR PATENT
PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, UTILITIES, OPERATING HISTORY OR
PROJECTIONS, VALUATION, GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, THE COMPLIANCE OF THE PROPERTY
WITH GOVERNMENTAL LAWS, THE TRUTH, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE PROPERTY
DOCUMENTS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER TO
PURCHASER, OR ANY OTHER MATTER OR THING REGARDING THE PROPERTY. PURCHASER
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT UPON CLOSING SELLER SHALL SELL AND CONVEY TO
PURCHASER AND PURCHASER SHALL ACCEPT THE PROPERTY "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL
FAULTS", EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE

OR FURNISHED BY SELLER, THE OPERATOR OF THE PROPERTY, OR ANY REAL ESTATE
BROKER OR AGENT REPRESENTING OR PURPORTING TO REPRESENT SELLER, TO WHOMEVER
MADE OR GIVEN, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ORALLY OR IN WRITING, UNLESS
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. PURCHASER REPRESENTS TO SELLER THAT
PURCHASER HAS CONDUCTED, OR WILL CONDUCT PRIOR TO CLOSING, SUCH INVESTIGATIONS
OF THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS THEREOF, AS PURCHASER DEEMS NECESSARY TO SATISFY ITSELF AS TO THE
CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY AND THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OR CURATIVE ACTION
TO BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO ANY HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES ON OR DISCHARGED
FROM THE PROPERTY, AND WILL RELY SOLELY UPON SAME AND NOT UPON ANY
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WITH
RESPECT THERETO, OTHER THAN SUCH REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF
SELLER AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. UPON CLOSING,
PURCHASER SHALL ASSUME THE RISK THAT ADVERSE MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS AND ADVERSE PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS, MAY NOT HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY PURCHASERS INVESTIGATIONS, AND
PURCHASER, UPON CLOSING, SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED, RELINQUISHED AND
RELEASED SELLER (AND SELLERS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND
AGENTS) FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION
(INCLUDING CAUSES OF ACTION IN TORT), LOSSES, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, COSTS AND
EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES AND COURT COSTS) OF ANY AND EVERY KIND OR
CHARACTER, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT HAVE ASSERTED OR ALLEGED
AGAINST SELLER (AND SELLERS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND

CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS OR PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, VIOLATIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LAWS
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS) AND ANY AND ALL OTHER
ACTS, OMISSIONS, EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR MATTERS REGARDING THE PROPERTY BUT
WITHOUT WAIVER OF PURCHASERS RIGHTS TO RELY ON AND OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

PURCHASER AND SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR SUCH CLEAN-UP,
REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION. AS PART OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 9.2_ , BUT
NOT AS A LIMITATION THEREON, PURCHASER HEREBY 



 

30 AGREES, REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THE MATTERS RELEASED HEREIN ARE NOT
LIMITED TO MATTERS WHICH ARE KNOWN OR DISCLOSED, AND PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND BENEFITS WHICH IT NOW HAS, OR IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE
CONFERRED UPON IT, BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAW,
RULES OF REGULATIONS.

9.3 _Effect and Survival of Disclaimers_. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge
that the compensation to be paid to Seller for the Property has
been decreased to take into account that the Property is being sold subject
to the provisions of this _Article IX_. Seller and Purchaser agree that the
provisions of this _Article IX_ shall survive Closing.

ARTICLE X

_MISCELLANEOUS _

10.1 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser and its representatives shall hold in
confidence all data and information obtained with respect to Seller or its
business, whether obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and shall not disclose the same to others; provided, however, that
Purchaser may disclose such data and information as may be required by law
and to the employees, consultants, accountants and attorneys of Purchaser,
provided that such persons are instructed in writing to treat such data and
information confidentially. In the event this Agreement is terminated or
Purchaser fails to perform hereunder, Purchaser shall promptly return to
Seller any statements, documents, schedules, exhibits or other written
information obtained from Seller in connection with this Agreement or the
transaction contemplated herein. In the event of a breach or threatened
breach by Purchaser or its agents or representatives of this _Section 10.1_,
Seller shall be entitled to an injunction restraining Purchaser or its agents
or representatives from disclosing, in whole or in part, such confidential
information. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting Seller from
pursuing damages or any other available remedy at law or in equity for such
breach or threatened breach. The provisions of this _Section 10.1_
shall survive Closing.

10.2 _Public Disclosure_. Prior to Closing, any release to the public of
information with respect to the sale contemplated herein or any matters set
forth in this Agreement will be made only in the form approved by Purchaser
and Seller and their respective counsel. Purchaser agrees to provide a copy of
any such proposed public announcement to Seller at least two business days
prior to its release in order to afford Seller an opportunity to review and
the right to approve the form and content of any such public release, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller acknowledges that Purchaser is beneficially owned by a
public company subject to disclosure requirements mandated by its governing
documents, law or stock exchange regulation and that public announcements with
respect to the information otherwise subject to the constraints set forth
above may be so mandated. If Seller is unable to afford Purchaser the two
business day period for review and approval of a proposed announcement based
on unanticipated events which, in the opinion of Purchasers securities
counsel, could expose Seller to violation of law or securities liability
absent such an announcement, Seller shall have the right to make such
announcement, provided that Purchaser in any event shall have provided Seller
with the proposed announcement prior to release and afforded Seller such
opportunity to review and approve the announcement as is reasonable in light
of the circumstances.



 

31 10.3 _Discharge of Obligations_. The acceptance of the Deed by Purchaser shall
be deemed to be a full performance and discharge of every representation and
warranty made by Seller herein and every agreement and obligation on the part
of Seller to be performed pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, except
those which are herein specifically stated to survive Closing.

10.4 _Assignment_. Purchaser may not assign its rights under this Agreement
without first obtaining Sellers written approval, which approval may be
given or withheld in Sellers sole discretion. Any transfer, directly or
indirectly, of any stock, partnership interest or other ownership interest in
Purchaser without Sellers written approval, which approval may be given or
withheld in Sellers sole discretion, shall constitute a default by Purchaser
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may assign this
Agreement, effective upon the Closing, to an affiliate of Purchaser owned or
controlled by Purchaser, provided that such assignment shall not modify the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or relieve Purchaser of any liability
hereunder. Consistent with the terms of the New HMA, Seller shall cooperate
and cause the Operator to cooperate in permitting Purchaser to structure its
ownership of the Property and specific components of the Property consistent
with its status as a real estate investment trust, provided that such
structure and any operating lease entered into to effect such structure shall
not adversely affect the rights of Seller or the rights or security of the
tenure of the Operator under the New HMA.

10.5 _Notices_. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be given in
writing by (a) personal delivery, or (b) nationally recognized overnight
delivery service with proof of delivery, or (c) United States Mail, postage
prepaid, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d)
legible facsimile transmission sent to the intended addressee at the address
set forth below, or to such other address or to the attention of such other
person as the addressee shall have designated by written notice sent in
accordance herewith, and shall be deemed to have been given either at the time
of personal delivery, or, in the case of expedited delivery service or mail,
as of the date of first attempted delivery at the address and in the manner
provided herein, or, in the case of facsimile transmission, as of the date of
the facsimile transmission provided that an original of such facsimile is
also sent to the intended addressee by means described in clauses (a), (b) or
(c) above. Unless changed in accordance with the preceding sentence, the

and the last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless such
last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday under the laws of the State in
which the Property is located or the United States of America, in which event
the period shall run until the end of the next day which is neither
a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. The final day of any such period shall
be deemed to end at 5 p.m., local time at the Property. The term "days" as
used herein shall mean calendar days, with the exception of "business
days", which term shall mean each day except for any Saturday, Sunday or
legal holiday under the laws of the State in which the Property is located or
the United States of America.

10.10 _Successors and Assigns_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are
to apply to and bind the permitted successors and assigns of the parties
hereto.

10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits, contains the
entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and fully supersedes all prior written or oral agreements and understandings
between the parties pertaining to such subject matter.

10.12 _Further Assurances_. Each party agrees that it will without further
consideration execute and deliver such other documents and take such other
action, whether prior or subsequent to Closing, as may be reasonably requested
by the other party to consummate more



 

33 effectively the purposes or subject matter of this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall, if requested by Seller,
execute acknowledgments of receipt with respect to any materials delivered by
Seller to Purchaser with respect to the Property. The provisions of this
_Section 10.12_ shall survive Closing.

10.13 _Counterparts; Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, and all such executed counterparts shall constitute the
same agreement. It shall be necessary to account for only one such
counterpart in proving this Agreement. Facsimile signatures on this Agreement
shall be same as original signatures for all purposes.

10.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect.

10.15 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT IS PERFORMABLE IN THE STATE IN WHICH
THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED AND SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE SUBSTANTIVE FEDERAL LAWS OF THE UNITED
STATES AND THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE. SELLER AND PURCHASER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE STATE
IN WHICH THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS IN
RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN A STATE
OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED.
PURCHASER AND SELLER AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10.15 SHALL
SURVIVE THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

10.16 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. The provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents to be executed and delivered at Closing are and will be for the
benefit of Seller and Purchaser only and are not for the benefit of any third

RESIDENTIAL EXPANSION PARCEL AGREEMENT 

by

_   _,

and

_   _,

Dated as of December 6, 2005 RESIDENTIAL EXPANSION PARCEL AGREEMENT

THIS RESIDENTIAL EXPANSION PARCEL AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as
of [September 1, 2006] (the " _Effective Date_ "), is made by and between
Scottsdale Princess Partnership, an Arizona general partnership (" _Seller_
"), and SHR Scottsdale, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Purchaser_ "). Fairmont Hotels and Resorts (U.S.) Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Operator_ ") joins this Agreement as a third party beneficiary.

RECITALS

A. Seller and Purchaser are parties to that certain Purchase and Sale
Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2006 (the " _Purchase and Sale Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which Seller has sold to Purchaser, and Purchaser has bought from
Seller, that certain real property commonly known as The Fairmont Scottsdale
Princess, as described more fully in the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "
_Hotel Property_ ").

B. Seller and Purchaser desire to memorialize certain agreements with respect
to the development of a portion of the Hotel Property known as "Parcel A/L1",
comprised of approximately ten (10) acres, as more specifically on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the " _Residential
Expansion Parcel_ ").

C. Operator, an affiliate of Seller and as the operator of the Hotel Property
pursuant to that certain Hotel Management Agreement dated as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _HMA_ ") is intended to be the third party beneficiary
of the agreements between Seller and Purchaser.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy
of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

(1) _Sale of the Residential Expansion Parcel to a Third Party_. If Purchaser
sells the Residential Expansion Parcel to an independent third party
unaffiliated with Purchaser on or before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the
Effective Date: (a) Purchaser shall remit to Seller fifty percent (50%) of
the net profit from such transaction (i.e., the gross sales price received for
the Residential Expansion Parcel less (i) all out of pocket costs, expenses,
fees and commissions paid by Seller following the Effective Date allocable
exclusively to the Residential Expansion Parcel and the sales transaction and
(ii) if applicable, the interest component of any release price paid to obtain
the release of any financing encumbering the Residential Expansion Parcel in
connection with the sale (but no portion of the principal component of such
release price based on an allocation of land value); and (b) for so long as
the HMA remains in full force and effect, Purchaser shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to have such third party covenant and enter
into agreements with Operator providing that any residential improvements
constructed on the Residential Expansion Parcel shall carry the " _Fairmont_
" brand, with appropriate standards and appropriate payments to Operator of
fees for association management and charges and reimbursements to the Hotel
Property, Operator or both, all as customary in comparable branded projects,
for allocated costs of maintenance and services. (2) _Development of the Residential Expansion Parcel by Purchaser for Whole
Ownership_. If Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser develops the
Residential Expansion Parcel with residential improvements intended for whole
(as opposed to fractional or time share) ownership on or before the tenth
(10th) anniversary of the Effective Date, then, for so long as the HMA
remains in full force and effect: (a) any such residential improvements
constructed on the Residential Expansion Parcel shall carry the " _Fairmont_ "
brand, with appropriate standards and appropriate payments to Operator of
fees for association management and charges and reimbursements to the Hotel
Property, Operator or both, all as customary in comparable branded projects,
maintenance and services; (b) Purchaser, or its affiliate, shall pay to
Operator a royalty fee equal to two percent (2%) of the gross sales price of
each unit sold; and (c) Purchaser shall institute a rental program such that
the owner or owner(s) of any such units may contribute their units for use by
the Hotel Property as additional transient guest room inventory, with payment
of a share of rental proceeds to the Hotel Property and with payments to
Operator for unit rental management services as customary in comparable
branded rental programs operated in conjunction with a hotel.

(3) _Development of the Residential Expansion Parcel by Purchaser
for Fractional Ownership_. If Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser
develops the Residential Expansion Parcel for use as time share or fractional
product (as opposed to use for a whole ownership product, which shall be
governed by Section (2) above): (a) such product shall carry the " _Fairmont_
" brand; (b) Operator shall have a marketing agreement to sell such product at
then-appropriate market rate fees (provided Operator then has an
appropriate marketing system in place); and (c) appropriate market rate
management, association, facilities access and maintenance fees and charges
shall be paid to Operator, the Hotel Property or both, as customary in
comparable branded time share or fractional projects operated in conjunction
with a hotel.

(4) _Relationship to the Hotel Property_.

(a) Based on its proximity to the Hotel Property, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that Operator shall have the right to review and approve
(which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld): (a) any
covenants, conditions and restrictions or easement agreement affecting the
Hotel Property for utilities, pedestrian and vehicular ingress and egress,
parking agreements or otherwise; (b) any agreements governing services,
utilities or other infrastructure to be provided by the Hotel Property to the
Residential Expansion Parcel and the fees and costs which may be assessed by
the Hotel Property, Operator or both therefor and budgets and allocations of
expenses for any shared facilities between the Hotel Property and the
Residential Expansion Parcel; and (c) the designs and plans of development for
the Residential Expansion Parcel, for the purpose of ensuring that the same
are compatible with architectural designs, features, colorations and material
usage of the Hotel Property. Purchaser (or any affiliate or successor in
ownership of or interest in the Residential Expansion Parcel) shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct any development activities on the
Residential Expansion Parcel in fashion designed to minimize any interference
with the guest experience at the Hotel Property or Operators ability to
operate the Hotel Property at the Standard.

(b) If Purchaser should determine not to sell the Residential Expansion Parcel
pursuant to Section 1 above or to conduct the residential developments
described in Sections 2 and 3 above, Purchaser shall nevertheless have the right to proceed with the
development on the Residential Expansion Parcel of additional guest rooms for
the Hotel Property, provided that (a) the aggregate number of guest rooms
added to the Hotel Property inventory through the Rooms Addition Project (as
defined in the HMA) and such development on the Residential Expansion Parcel
shall not exceed 350 and (b) any such development shall be treated as a
Development Project governed by and subject to Operators rights set forth in
Section 10.5 of the HMA.

(5) _Limitation_. For so long as the HMA remains in full force and effect,
Purchaser covenants and agrees that Purchaser, its affiliates and its
successors in ownership of or interest in the Residential Expansion Parcel (a)
shall limit development on the Residential Expansion Parcel to residential
uses (including customary ancillary facilities) developed, marketed and
maintained as luxury class product and (b) shall _not_ develop or operate on
the Residential Expansion Parcel (i) any hotel, condominium hotel or similar
transient use product or (ii) any residential whole ownership, fractional or
time share or other residential product) under the brand or with the
participation of any Competitor. For such purposes, (A) "Competitor" shall
mean any party, directly or indirectly through an affiliate, primarily engaged
in the business of operating a Lodging System of hotels or similar transient
use products and (B) "Lodging System" shall mean a group of hotels or similar
facilities that are operated, licensed or franchised under a brand (e.g.,
Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis or Four Seasons) utilizing group services (e.g.
reservation services, sales and marketing services, human resources and
employee benefit services, account services or purchasing services) that are
provided across such group of hotels or similar facilities.

(6) _Notices_. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be given in writing
by (a) personal delivery, or (b) nationally recognized overnight delivery
service with proof of delivery, or (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid,
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) legible
facsimile transmission sent to the intended addressee at the address set
forth below, or to such other address or to the attention of such other person
as the addressee shall have designated by written notice sent in accordance
