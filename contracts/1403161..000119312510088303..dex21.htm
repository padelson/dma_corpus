Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 

1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and
Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the " _Effective
Time_ ") as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. The closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP, located at 525 University Avenue, Suite 1100, Palo

or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those that
by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), or at such other
time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall have no obligation to close on any day during
the last fifteen (15) calendar days of any fiscal quarter end of Parent,
including the periods between (x) June 15 and July 1, 2010, (y) September 15,

foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,

in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be
identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of
Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, _Article I_
of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the
corporation is CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION." At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of

to be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware
Law and as provided in the Bylaws; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective
Time, the Title of the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "Bylaws of CyberSource
Corporation."

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to
the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the directors of



 

2  Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until the earlier of
their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified. Unless otherwise determined by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly appointed. In addition, unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors and
officers, respectively of each of the Companys Subsidiaries immediately after
the Effective Time, each to hold office as a director or officer of each such
Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the Laws of the respective
jurisdiction of organization and the respective bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of each such Subsidiary.

 

1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following shall
occur:

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of the Companys common stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_, will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to _Section 1.7_) into
the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $26.00, without interest (such
amount of cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ") to
be distributed in the manner provided in _Section 1.8_ (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner provided in _Section 1.10_).

(b) _Cashed-Out Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
either (A) held by any Person other than an employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each such Company Option, a " _Non-Employee Option_ ") or
(B) that is vested as of the Effective Time, giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger or as a result of the
adjustment to vesting schedules pursuant to Section 5.9(a) of this Agreement
(each such Company Option, a " _Vested Option_ ,") or (C) that has a per share
exercise price greater than the per share Merger Consideration and together
with the Non-Employee Options and the Vested Options, the " _Cashed-Out
Options_ "), and, in each case, that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its entirety at the
Effective Time, and the holder of each Cashed-Out Option shall be entitled to
receive therefor an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent),
if any, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock as to which such Company Option was vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to any acceleration of vesting
resulting from the Merger), and (ii) the excess, if any, of the per share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent will promptly following
the Closing deliver to the Exchange Agent a list of all holders of Cashed-Out
Options for payment without further action required by such holders of such
Cashed-Out Options.

  

 

3 (c) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. After the Effective
Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate (including accelerating an offering or purchase
period), so that effective no later than the Effective Date, the Company 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") will be terminated and
no participants under the Company ESPP will have any further
rights thereunder from and following the Effective Time. To the extent any
offering period under the Company ESPP is in progress prior to such
termination, the Company shall ensure that such offering period shall end
prior to such termination, and that each participants accumulated
contributions for such offering period are applied towards the purchase of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such termination unless the
participant has previously withdrawn from such offering period in accordance
with the terms of such plan.

(f) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 

1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
other than _Section 1.7(b)_, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a
holder who: (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing, (ii) has perfected its rights to appraisal in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law and (iii) as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights (collectively,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration set forth in _Section
1.6_, but instead shall be converted into the right to receive only
such consideration as may be determined to be due to the holder thereof as
provided by Delaware Law. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights
or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a
stockholder of Parent.



 

4 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.7(a)_, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware
Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in
_Section 1.6_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal rights of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Delaware Law and received by the Company which relate to any such demand for
appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time with
respect to demands for appraisal rights under Delaware Law. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such
demands. Any communication to be made by the Company to any holder of Company
Common Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and shall not be presented to any holder of Company Common Stock prior
to the Company receiving Parents consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.

 

1.8 _Surrender of Certificates or Transfer of Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
national bank or trust company to act as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated
shares represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each
instance other than Dissenting Shares, in accordance with this _Article I_ and
Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agent agreement with the
Exchange Agent.

(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_ , cash in
an amount sufficient to pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and all Cashed-Out Options. Any cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.6(a)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall otherwise be in customary form) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for cash constituting the Merger Consideration. Upon (x) surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly 



 

5  completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of record of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash
constituting the Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered or
Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
respectively, will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration
into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted.
No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this _Article I_.

 

(d) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options or otherwise, such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable
Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of
such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have
been paid.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.8_, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any person in respect of Merger Consideration from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar federal, state, local, municipal, or
foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit,
constitution, principle of common law, resolution, ordinance, code, edict,
directive, rule, regulation, ruling, judgment or requirement issued, enacted,
adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into effect by or under the
authority of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Law_ ").

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided, however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
Company stockholders pursuant to this _Article I_ shall promptly be paid to
Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate
to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall
be entitled under this _Article I_, Parent shall take all steps necessary to
deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make
all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent shall in any event be
liable for payment thereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(g)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
Cashed-Out

 



 

6  Options six (6) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the
Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation to be held in
trust for such holders or otherwise according to the instruction of the
Surviving Corporation, and any Person entitled to payment in accordance with
this _Article I_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
solely as general creditors for the cash constituting the Merger
Consideration (which shall not accrue interest) pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby.

 

1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock will
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Law. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article I_.

1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such cash constituting the
Merger Consideration;  _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

1.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things
reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of the Merger.

taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ ," when used
with respect to any party, shall mean any corporation, association, business
entity, partnership, limited liability company or other Person of which such

Subsidiaries.

Documents_ "), of each of its Subsidiaries that is a "significant subsidiary"
within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (a "
_Significant Subsidiary_ "), and each such instrument is in full force and
effect. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Charter Documents and each of its Subsidiaries is not in violation of
its respective Subsidiary Charter Documents. The Company has made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft
minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the shareholders,
the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2007, except in
each case for (i) records that may discuss the Merger or strategic
alternatives and (ii) draft minutes pending approval by the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof.

(c) _Subsidiaries_. _Section 2.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets

owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, each such Subsidiary and all such shares have been duly

clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, mortgages, deeds of trust,
restrictions, easements, encumbrances, options and security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), (including any
restriction on the right to



 

8  vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests), except for Permitted Liens and
restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws. Other than the
Subsidiaries of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests of any nature
in, or any interest convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests of any nature in, any other
Person.

(a) _Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of:
(i) 125,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 5,610,969 shares of

is a party or by which it is bound.

 

(b) _Company Options_. As of the close of business on April 16, 2010: (i)
10,473,594 shares of Company Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock under the Companys 1999

maintained under which stock options or other compensatory equity-based awards
have been or may be granted. Except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no commitments or agreements of

the Company ESPP for, and as of, the end of the most recent bi-weekly payroll
period ending prior to the date hereof. There are no outstanding or

or sold, additional shares of capital stock, other voting securities or
any securities convertible into shares of capital stock, or other voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligating the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any
such security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement,
instrument, obligation or undertaking. There are no outstanding Contracts to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of

repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(ii) dispose of any shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, any of its Subsidiaries. The Company is not a party to any
voting agreement with respect to shares of the capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to
the Companys Knowledge, there are no irrevocable proxies and no voting
agreements, voting trusts, rights plans, anti-takeover plans or registration

to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject, in the case of consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders as contemplated in
_Section 5.2_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly



 

10  authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and
no further action is required on the part of the Company to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, subject only to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders as contemplated by _Section 5.2_ and
the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to Delaware Law. The

Company capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Shareholder
Approval_ "). The Board of Directors of the Company has, by resolution adopted
by unanimous vote of those directors present (with one director absent) at a
meeting of Directors duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way (except as is permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_

the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders and declared the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby to be advisable, (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt
this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted to the Companys
stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws relating to or affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally and to general principles of equity. 

(b) _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not (i)

the Company Charter Documents or any Subsidiary Charter Documents of any
Significant Subsidiary of the Company or the organizational documents of
CyberSource K.K, (ii) subject to obtaining the adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders as contemplated in _Section 5.2_ and compliance
with the requirements set forth in _Section 2.3(c)_, conflict with or
violate any material Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets (whether tangible or intangible) is bound or affected or
(iii) result in any material breach of or constitute a material default (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a material
default) under, or materially impair the Companys rights or to the
Companys Knowledge, alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of any Company Material Contract or any Governmental
Authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in the creation of a Lien on
any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
other than Permitted Liens. _Section 2.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists all consents, waivers and approvals required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under
any Company Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or any
of their properties or assets is bound or affected, which, if individually or
in the aggregate, not obtained, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a



 

11  whole, or result in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any
material penalties or other financial obligations or to materially and
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger
within the time frame in which the Merger would otherwise be consummated in
the absence of the need for such consent, waiver or approval.

 

(c) _Necessary Consents_. No consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization
of, or registration, declaration or filing with any supranational, national,
state, municipal, local or foreign government, any instrumentality,
subdivision, court, arbitral body, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality or any quasi-governmental
or private body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing or other
governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a " _Governmental Entity_ ") or
any other Person is required to be obtained or made by the Company in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and

merger control regulations identified in _Section 2.3(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (iv) approval of the Companys stockholders as

securities Laws or the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market and

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to materially
and adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
Merger within the time frame in which the Merger would otherwise be
consummated in the absence of the need for such consent, waiver, approval,
order, authorization, registration, declaration or filing. The consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings set
forth in (i) through (vi) are referred to herein as the " _Necessary
Consents_."

registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated

prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents, as
each of the foregoing have been amended since the time of their filing,
(including those that the Company may file subsequent to the date hereof) are

12  and complied in all material respects with, the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange
Act, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and, in each
case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Documents and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on
the date of such filing), and each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent
to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries
is required to file or furnish any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of all amendments and modifications effected prior to the date of this
Agreement that have not yet been filed by the Company with the SEC but which
are required to be filed, to Contracts and other documents that previously
had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are currently in effect. The
Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other, since January 1, 2007, including all SEC
comment letters and written responses to such comment letters by or on behalf
of the Company. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, none
of the Company SEC Documents are the subject of ongoing SEC review or
outstanding SEC comment. Each of the principal executive officers of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former
principal executive officer of the Company and each former principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to the Company SEC
Documents and, at the time of filing or submission of such certification, such
certification was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Document filed after the date hereof until the Closing: (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States

basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as
may be permitted by the SEC and (iii) fairly and accurately presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of the Companys operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements). As of the date of this Agreement,
the Company does not intend to correct or restate, and to the Companys
Knowledge, there is not any basis to correct or restate, any of the Company
Financials. The consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 contained in the Company SEC
Documents is hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Balance Sheet_." Except
as disclosed in the Company Financials, since December 31, 2009, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a
consolidated balance sheet or in the related 



 

13  notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP, except for (i) liabilities incurred since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (ii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has not had any dispute with
any of its auditors regarding material accounting matters or policies during
any of its past five full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-
date. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC).

 

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system of
internal controls over financial reporting required by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15
of the Exchange Act sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated

procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that material information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries is
promptly made known to the officers responsible for establishing and
maintaining the system of internal controls, (iii) provide reasonable

accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Board
of Directors of the Company, (iv) provide reasonable assurance that access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific

regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (vii)
provide reasonable assurance that any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the Companys management or other Employees who

ARTICLE V

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

5.1 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, will
prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials that will constitute
the Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after any comments
are received from the SEC thereon (or upon notice from the SEC that no such
comments will be made), the Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
prepare and file any required amendments to, and the definitive, Proxy
Statement with the SEC. The Company will notify Parent promptly upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff in connection with the
filing of, or amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement. Whenever any
event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, the Company will promptly inform Parent of such
occurrence and will, in consultation with Parent, file with the SEC or its
staff, and/or mail to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or
supplement. The Company shall provide Parent (and its counsel) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the preliminary Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to filing such with
the SEC, and will provide Parent with a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC. Subject to _Section 5.3(d)_, the Company will cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
definitive Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC.

 

5.2 _Meeting of Company Stockholders; Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) _Meeting of Company Stockholders_. Subject to _Section 5.3(d)_, the
Company will take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law, its
Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws to establish a record date, duly

of the adoption of this Agreement and will take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the
rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or Delaware Law or any other applicable Law
to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders
Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of
a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of the time for which the
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of such Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall ensure that the
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and

in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of its Board of
Directors that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this
Agreement.

(a) _No Solicitation_. The Company agrees that none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries officers and
directors shall, and that it shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the

submission of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) conduct or engage in any

an Acquisition Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby, or (vi)
terminate, amend or waive any material rights under (or fail to enforce by

Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any other Person, except in the case of
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) to the extent specifically permitted
pursuant to  _Section 5.3(c)_ or _5.3(d)_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations (including any such activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted by affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to consideration of any proposal that is or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to exercise any rights under any
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements with any such third parties to
require the return or destruction of non-public information provided prior to
the date of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their agents
and representatives to any such third parties.

(b) _Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information or inquiry that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or from any

data to any person, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable
after such meeting (and in any event 24 hours prior to entering into any
such discussions or negotiations or providing any non-public information or
data to any person). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including, if applicable, (and in
any event within 24 hours) any material amendments or proposed amendments as
to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall, subject to
applicable Law, promptly provide Parent a copy of all written materials
subsequently provided to, by or on behalf of such Person or group in
connection with such an Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.



 

50 (c) _Superior Offers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
_Section 5.3(a)_, in the event that the Company receives prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company in accordance
with applicable Law an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
from a third party that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_
and that the Companys Board of Directors has in good faith concluded, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Offer, the Company may then (1) furnish non-public information to the
third party making such Acquisition Proposal and (2) engage in negotiations
with the third party with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that:

(i) the Company complies with all of the terms of this _Section 5.3_;

(ii) prior to furnishing any non-public information or entering into
any negotiations or discussions with such third party, (1) the Company
receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement
containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public
written and oral information furnished to such third party on the Companys
behalf in substantially the form of the Confidentiality Agreement and, in any
event, no less restrictive to such third party than the Confidentiality
Agreement is with respect to Parent (including with respect to "standstill"
and "non-solicitation" provisions) and (2) contemporaneously with furnishing
any such non-public information to such third party, the Company furnishes
such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such non-public
information has not been previously so furnished); and

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
provide such information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would
be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

(d) _Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in _Section 5.3(a)_, in response to the receipt of a Superior
Offer, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, amend
or modify its recommendation in favor of the Merger, and, in the case of a
Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to the
stockholders of the Company, may recommend that the stockholders of the
Company accept the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions,
whether by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "), (y) the Board of Directors of the Company, the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents or other representatives) may approve, endorse, or
recommend any Superior Offer or recommend a Superior Offer, or (z) the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries may execute or enter into or propose to execute or
enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement
or commitment (which may be conditioned on the termination of this Agreement)
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Superior Offer or 



 

51  transaction contemplated thereby, if all of the following conditions in
clauses (i) through (vi) are met:

 

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that a Superior Offer has been made and not withdrawn;

(ii) the stockholders of the Company have not approved this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law;

(iii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice (a " _Change
of Recommendation Notice_ ") at least five (5) Business Days prior to publicly
effecting such Change of Recommendation which shall state expressly (A) that
the Company has received a Superior Offer, (B) the final terms and conditions
of the Superior Offer and the identity of the Person or group making the
Superior Offer and (C) that the Company intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation;

 

(iv) after delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement during such five- (5) Business Day
period, and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such five- (5)
Business Day period, as would enable the Company to proceed with its
recommendation to stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement without
making a Change of Recommendation;

 

(v) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined (A) after
consultation with its financial advisor, that the terms of the Superior Offer
are more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger (taking
into account as it may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (iv) above) and (B)
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation would result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; and

 

(vi) the Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
_Section 5.2_ or this _Section 5.3_. 

In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or
fail to make, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the adoption and approval
of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger in response to a material
fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances (other than
an Acquisition Proposal occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement) that was not known to the Board of Directors of the Company nor
reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors of the Company as of or prior
to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition
Proposal) (an " _Intervening Recommendation Change_ " and such material fact,
change, development or set of circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel,



 

52  that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to effect such an Intervening Recommendation Change
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ that no fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if such fact,
event, change, development or set of circumstances resulted from or arose out
of the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger; and _provided,
further_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its rights to
make an Intervening Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless
the Company has (A) provided to Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to take such action and specifying the facts underlying the
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company that an Intervening
Event has occurred, an the reasons for the Intervening Recommendation Change,
in reasonable detail, and (B) during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
the Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Intervening
Recommendation Change.

 

In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
meeting of the Company stockholders, there shall have been a Change
of Recommendation unless this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, pursuant to _Article VII_ , the Company shall
nevertheless submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for
adoption.

 

(e) _Compliance with Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from complying
with Rules 14-a-9, 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, such disclosure is
required in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with
its fiduciary obligations, or is otherwise required under applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall
be governed by the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation unless specifically
permitted pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.3(d)_.

 

(f) _State Takeover Statute_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not,
in connection with any Change of Recommendation, take any action to change
the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other state Law to be applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section
5.3(f)_ shall not prohibit the Company from effecting a Change of
Recommendation under the circumstances and subject to the conditions set forth
in this _Section 5.3_.

 

(g) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ ," with respect to the Company, shall mean any
offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (a) any purchase from such party or acquisition by any
Person or "group" (as defined under _Section 13(d)_ of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent (15%)
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or

 



 

53  any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b)
any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) any sale, lease (other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice), acquisition or disposition of more than
fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the Company (including
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) or (d) any liquidation or dissolution of
the Company ( _provided, however_ , that the transactions between Parent and
the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not be deemed an Acquisition
Proposal); and 

(ii) " _Superior Offer_ ," with respect to the Company, shall mean an
unsolicited, _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal by a third party on terms that
the Board of Directors of the Company has in good faith concluded, after
consultation with its financial adviser, taking into account, among other
things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and
the Person making the offer, to be more favorable to the Companys
stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of the
Merger and is reasonably capable of being consummated, _provided_ that each
reference to fifteen percent (15%) in the definition of " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall be replaced with "50%" for purposes hereof, _provided,
further_ that any material amendment to any Superior Offer will be deemed to
be a new Superior Offer for purposes of _Section 5.3(d)_.

(h) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled
to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of
posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this  _Section 5.3_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at
law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, agent,
representative or affiliate of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement by the Company. 

5.4 _Confidentiality; Access to Information; No Modification of
Representations, Warranties or Covenants_.

 

(a) _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent
have previously executed a Confidential Disclosure Agreement effective as of
March 1, 2010 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Confidential Disclosure
Agreement effective as of March 29, 2010, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except that the standstill provisions contained
therein shall terminate on the date hereof, and each of Parent and the Company
will hold, and will cause its respective directors, officers,
Employees, agents, affiliates and advisors



 

54  (including attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial
advisors) to hold and keep confidential, any " _Confidential_ _Information_ "
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) _Access to Information_. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and
applicable Law, the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel
and other representatives, reasonable access (during regular business hours
upon reasonable notice) during the period from the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, books, contracts, personnel,
commitments and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ ,
that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and all capitalization and
equity compensation information that is necessary for Parent to promptly
comply with applicable Law (to the extent such information is in
the possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries or its independent
registered accountants, and which shall be made available in the form that the
Company or its independent registered accountants possess it) and (ii) all
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject
to reasonable procedures as the parties may agree) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the
Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (A) any Law,
treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Company requires such party to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, (B) such disclosure would, based on the advice of
outside legal counsel to the Company, result in a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege
applicable to such information, or (C) the disclosure of such information to
Parent would violate confidentiality obligations owed to a third party and
such confidentiality obligations were in effect prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. Parent shall not use any information obtained from
the Company or any of its Subsidiary pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 5.4_ for any purposes other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent will not share,
provide or sell such information to any third party or use the information in
any manner that would result in a violation of any applicable Law. Subject to
the foregoing proviso, the Company agrees to promptly provide to Parent and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of such internal
financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) as
may be reasonably requested. Any information obtained from the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the access contemplated by this  _Section
5.4_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) _No Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification
pursuant to this _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.6_ or _Section 5.7_, or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.

 

5.5 _Public Disclosure_. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon and use all reasonable efforts to agree on any press release or public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and any Acquisition Proposal and will not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and (to the extent

 



 

55  practicable) agreement, except as may be required by Law or any listing
agreement with the Nasdaq Stock Market, or any other applicable national or
regional securities exchange or market. 

5.6 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.

 

(a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use all reasonable
efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action that
would impede compliance with, all applicable Laws, and as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, application or submission of other documents
required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) Notification and Report
Forms with the FTC and the DOJ as required by the HSR Act, (ii) filings under
any other comparable pre-merger notification forms reasonably determined by
Parent and the Company to be required by the merger notification or control
Laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto and (iii)
any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities Laws of
any foreign country, or any other applicable Law relating to the Merger. Each
of Parent and the Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for
filing with any Governmental Entity under this _Section 5.6(a)_ to comply in
all material respects with all applicable Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each shall promptly supply the other with any information that may be
required in order to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to this 
_Section 5.6(a)_.

(b) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, applicable Law. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or
supplement.

 

(c) _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of
_Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.3_ and  _Section 5.6(d)_ hereof and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the parties
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the following: (i) the taking of all commercially
reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VI_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations, submissions and filings (including registrations, declarations,
and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding by any

 



 

56  Governmental Entity, (iii) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iv) the obtaining of consents, approvals and waivers from third parties
reasonably requested by Parent to be obtained in connection with the
Transaction under any Contracts or leases, _provided, however_ , that in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to
the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any person to
obtain any such consent, approval or waiver other than _de minimus_ amounts
or amounts that are advanced by Parent, and (v) the execution or delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement; 
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall this _Section 5.6(c)_ require
Parent to take any action that is reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect the benefits expected to be derived by Parent or its
affiliates (other than Merger Sub) as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby or would be reasonably expected to materially and
adversely affect Parent or its affiliates (other than Merger Sub) following
the consummation of the Merger. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover
statute or similar applicable Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use
all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) _No Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of
Divestiture. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture. For purposes of this
Agreement, an " _Action of Divestiture_ " shall mean (i) any license, sale or
other disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a trust
or otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or
properties of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent,
its subsidiaries or affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct
their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire,
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and,
in the case of Parent, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(iii) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or
affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries under any statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing
competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices.

5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) _By the Company_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Merger Sub of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, (ii) any failure of the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (iii)
the occurrence of any event that could reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could
reasonably be



 

57  expected to cause the failure of any conditions to the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub under _Section 6.2_; _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the Company or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
_provided, further_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.7(a)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder.

(b) _By Parent_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company
of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate, (ii) any failure of Parent to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (iii) the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could
reasonably be expected to cause the failure of any conditions to the
obligations of the Company under  _Section 6.3_; _provided, however_ , that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder.

 

5.8 _Third-Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
material consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries
respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably
requested by Parent after consultation with the Company, including all
consents, waivers and approvals set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. In connection with seeking such consents, waivers and
approvals, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all material
developments and shall, at Parents request, include Parent in any discussions
or communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought
hereunder. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form acceptable
to Parent. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, Parent shall
not have any liability to the Company, its stockholders or any other Person
for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company
seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals.

5.9 _Equity Awards and Employee Matters_. 

(a) _Substitution for Certain Employee Stock Options_. Subject to _Sections
5.9(b)_ and _(c)_ , at the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
Option other than Cashed-Out Options (each a " _Rollover Option_ "),
regardless of the respective exercise prices thereof, will terminate and be
substituted for by options (each a " _Parent Option_ ") to purchase Parent
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ")
under the Visa Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _Parent
Stock Plan_ "). Except as described below, each Rollover Option so
substituted for by Parent under this Agreement will be subject to the terms
and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan in accordance with this _Section
5.9(a)_, except that the number of shares subject to such Parent Option, the
exercise price of such Parent Option and certain additional terms of such
Parent Option shall be determined as follows: (i) each such Parent Option will
be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
the applicable Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the ratio of the value of the per



 

58  share Merger Consideration to the value of the closing price for a share of
Parent Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date
(such ratio, the " _Option Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Parent Option
will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which the applicable Rollover Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent, (iii) all options shall be converted
into non-qualified stock options, even if they were granted as "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) and (iv) certain terms
of the Rollover Options shall be adjusted to conform the Rollover Options to
the terms of the Parent Stock Plan, including conversion of the vesting
schedule from monthly vesting to annual vesting as follows: if, as of the
Effective Time (A) the Company Option has vested less than twelve (12)
months, then the number of options to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant
to such Company Option that are vested as of the Effective Time will remain
vested and the remaining portion of the Company Option will vest one-third on
each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the original grant date
of such option, rounded up, in each case, to the nearest whole share; (B) the
Company Option has vested at least twelve (12) months, but less than twenty-
four (24) months, then the greater of (x) the number of options to purchase
Company Common Stock pursuant to such Company Option that are vested as of the
Effective Time or (y) one-third of the number of options to purchase Company
Common Stock pursuant to such Company Option will vest as of the Effective
Time and the remaining portion of the Company Option will vest in equal
amounts on each of the second and third anniversaries of the original grant
date of such option, rounded up, in each case, to the nearest whole share;
(C) the Company Option has vested at least twenty-four (24) months, but less
than thirty-six (36) months, then the greater of (x) the number of number of
options to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to such Company Option that
are vested as of the Effective Time or (y) two-thirds of the number of options
to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to such Company Option will vest as
of the Effective Time and the remaining portion of the Company Option will
vest on the third anniversary of the original grant date of such option; and
(D) the Company Option has vested for thirty-six (36) or more months, then the
options to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to such Company Option will
vest in full as of the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practicable,
Parent will use all reasonable efforts to issue to each Person who holds a
Rollover Option a document evidencing the foregoing substitution of such
Rollover Option for a Parent Option and, as a condition to such substitution,
each former holder of a Company Option so substituted for by Parent shall
acknowledge the receipt of the same in exchange for such holders Company
Option. If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms of the Company
Stock Option Plans or pursuant to the terms of any Company Option granted to
directors of the Company thereunder, the Company shall use reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of each such holder of outstanding Company Options to
effectuate the treatment of such Company Options pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Company agrees that the Company Stock Option Plans and related
agreements shall be amended, to the extent necessary, to reflect the
transactions contemplated herein.

(b) _Section 409A of the Code_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section
5.9(a)_ to the contrary, Parent shall take all steps necessary to ensure that
conversion of Company Options provided for in _Section 5.9(a)_ shall be
effected in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code, and that the
holders of the Rollover Options shall not be subject to any taxes



 

59  or penalties under Section 409A of the Code as a result of the conversion of
such Rollover Options.

 

(c) _Option Cashouts_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.9(a)_ to the
contrary, in the event that Parent, in its sole discretion, determines that
it is not in the best interests of the Company, Parent or a holder of a
Rollover Option, to substitute for a Rollover Option, then the Parent shall,
no later than five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, determine that such
option shall be cashed out pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ of this Agreement,
and such Rollover Option shall treated as a Cashed-Out Option for all purposes
of this Agreement. Parent shall timely communicate to the Company
its decision to cash out Rollover Options pursuant to this _Section 5.9(c)_.

(d) _Notices_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each
holder of a Rollover Option a document evidencing the substitution of such
Rollover Option by Parent.

 

(e) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each a " _401(k) Plan_
") unless Parent provides written notice to the Company, no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, that any such 401(k) plan shall
not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company,
the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have
been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. Parent
shall take all steps necessary to permit each Employee who has received an
eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from each 401(k) Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution as
part of any lump sum distribution to the extent permitted by each 401(k) Plan
into an account under Parents 401(k) plan (the " _Parent_ __ _s 401(k)
Plan_ "), to the extent permitted by Parents 401(k) Plan.

 

(f) _Benefit Plans_. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each
person who was an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains an employee of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Employees_ "), for a period of not less than one (1) year from
and after the Closing Date (or if shorter, for so long as such employee
remains in such employment), compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to such employee to the compensation
and benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent
(but not taking into account the value of any equity or equity-related
benefits or compensation for purposes of determining the value of the benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
confer upon any Continuing Employee the right to continue in employment
following the Effective Time, or is intended to interfere with Parents, the
Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries rights (i) to terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason or no reason following
the Effective Time or (ii) to amend, modify or terminate any Company Employee
Plan or Employee Agreement in the sole discretion of the Parent or Surviving
Corporation, or the right of any Continuing Employee to terminate his or her
own employment for any or no reason following the Effective Time. To the



 

60  extent that Continuing Employees participate in any of Parents employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements following the Effective
Time, including, but not limited to, any severance plan, medical plan, dental
plan, life insurance plan, Code Section 401(k) arrangement, vacation program
or disability plan (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "), such
Continuing Employees shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under the Parent Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employees
participate solely to the extent such Continuing Employees were credited with
service under comparable plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
such purposes; _provided, however_ , that no such employee shall be entitled
to such credit (i) to the extent that it results in duplication of benefits,
or (ii) for purposes of any incentive compensation or sabbatical plan,
policy, program, agreement or arrangement, or any arrangement similar to the
foregoing. With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent for the benefit of Continuing Employees on and after
the Closing Date, Parent shall (1) cause there to be waived any eligibility
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations solely to the extent
permitted under such Parent Benefit Plan and solely to the extent such
requirements and limitations were waived or attained under comparable plans
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and (2) for the plan year that includes the Effective Time, give effect,
in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts
paid during the plan year that included the Effective Time by such Continuing
Employees with respect to similar plans maintained by Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.9(f)_, except to the extent
otherwise agreed between Parent and any Company Employee from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume, honor and continue, or shall cause to be
assumed, honored and continued, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all change in control severance agreements between the Company
and any Continuing Employee as in effect at the Effective Time and as set
forth on Section 5.9(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including with
respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with any other event), without any amendment or modification, other than as
required to comply with applicable Law.

 

(h) The Company will be responsible for all requisite notices, payments and
employee transfers required under any works councils agreements and necessary
to consummate the transaction, or as any such actions are requested by the
Parent.

It is acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that all provisions
contained in this _Section 5.9_ with respect to employees are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties and shall not create any right in
any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant
in any Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement or any participant in any
Parent employee benefit plan or any beneficiary thereof.

 

5.10 _Indemnification_.

(a)  _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will
cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to the indemnification agreements between
the Company and its directors and officers in effect as of the date hereof
and listed in _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure

  

 

61  Schedule (including, to the extent indemnifiable thereunder, for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), subject to applicable Law. The certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions will not, except as required by Law, be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of Indemnified Parties or any other person who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company,

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain directors and
officers liability insurance with one or more reputable unaffiliated third-
party insurers covering those persons who are covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date
hereof for events occurring prior to the Effective Time of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than those applicable to the
current directors and officers of the Company under policies maintained by the
Company ; _provided, however_ , that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year in excess of two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such coverage (and to the extent annual premium would exceed two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of such annual premium); and  _provided,
further, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its
obligations under this _Section 5.10(a) _by purchasing a "tail" policy under
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i)
has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers
those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time and (iii) contains terms
and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured
than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof.

(c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This  _Section 5.10_ is intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns, and shall
be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. On and after the Closing, the obligations of Parent under this
_Section 5.10_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this _Section
5.10_ without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. In the
event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successor and assign of Parent or the

 



 

62  Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth
with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in
this _Section 5.10_.

 

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of _Section 16(a)_ of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

5.12 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed FIRPTA Certificate in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

Parent is curable by Parent prior to the End Date through the exercise of
reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under

of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue;
_provided, however_ , that if such inaccuracy in the Companys representations
and warranties or breach by the Company is curable by the Company prior to
the End Date through the exercise of reasonable efforts, then Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(g)_ prior to thirty (30)
days following the receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent to
the Company of such breach provided the Company continues to exercise all
reasonable efforts to cure such breach through such thirty (30)-day period;

 

(h) by the Company, if, prior to the adoption of the Agreement by the
Companys stockholders, the Company shall have entered into a
definitive binding agreement with respect to a Superior Offer pursuant to and
in compliance with _Section 5.3(d)_, the Company shall have paid Parent the
Termination Fee described in _Section 7.3(b)_; and

 

(i) by Parent, if any Effect, either individually or in the aggregate, shall
have occurred since the date hereof that has, or could reasonably be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

For the purposes of this Agreement, a " _Triggering Event_ , __" with respect
to the Company, shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof shall for any reason other than an
Intervening Event have withdrawn or shall have amended or modified in a
manner adverse to Parent its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, (ii) it shall have failed to
include, for any reason other than an Intervening Event, in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors in favor of the
adoption of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, (iii) its Board
of Directors or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) the Company shall have entered into any letter of
intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or commitment accepting
any Superior Offer in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.3(d)_ or (v)
the Company breaches any of its obligations set forth in _Section 5.2_ or
_Section 5.3_, _provided, however_ , that with respect to any breach by the
Company of _Section 5.3_, such breach is willful and material.

 

7.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Other than with respect to
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, any termination of this Agreement
under _Section 7.1_ above will be effective immediately upon the delivery of
a valid written notice of the terminating

 



 

66  party to the other party hereto. Any termination of this Agreement under
_Section 7.1(h)_ will be effective upon the later of delivery of a valid
written notice of the Company to Parent and payment of the Termination fee
described in _Section 7.3(b)_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect, except (i) as set forth in _Section 5.4(a)_, this _Section
7.2_, _Section 7.3 _and _Article VIII_ , each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any material breach of this Agreement. No termination of
this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the
Company shall share equally the fees in connection with the filing of
the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR
Act, and all premerger notification and reports forms under similar applicable
Laws of other jurisdictions, in each case pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_.

 

(b) _Company Payment_.

 

(i) _Payment_. Other than as set forth below, the Company shall promptly, but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of termination
pursuant to the sections of this Agreement as set forth below, pay Parent a
fee equal to $65 million in immediately available funds (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") in the event that this Agreement is (i) terminated by Parent pursuant
to _Section 7.1(e)(i)_, (ii) terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_, _provided, however_ , in the case of termination under _Section
7.1(h)_, payment of the Termination Fee by the Company shall be made prior to
such termination, or (iii) terminated by Parent or the Company, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(d)_, _Section 7.1(e)(ii)_, or 
_Section 7.1(g)_, _provided, however_ , in the case of termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1(g)_, that the breach by the Company giving rise to
termination is willful; _provided, further_ , that in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(d)_, or _Section
7.1(g)_, (a) such payment shall be made only if prior to the termination of
this Agreement, there has been disclosure publicly or to any member of
the Board of Directors or any officer of the Company of an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company and within twelve (12) months following
the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition of the Company is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement or letter of
intent with a third party with respect to an Acquisition of the Company and
(b) such payment shall be made promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the consummation of such Acquisition of the Company or
the entry into such definitive agreement or letter of intent by the Company.



 

67 (ii) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3(b)_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this
_Section 7.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim
that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in
this _Section 7.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable costs
and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to this _Section 7.3(b)_ at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described
in this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the
event of breach of this Agreement. 

(iii) _Certain Definitions_. For the purposes of this _Section 7.3(b)_
only, " _Acquisition_ ," with respect to a party hereto, shall mean any of
the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the party pursuant to which the equity interests held in such party and
retained following such transaction or issued to or otherwise received in such
transaction by the stockholders of the party immediately preceding such
transaction constitute less than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any
direct or indirect parent thereof, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the
party of assets representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate
fair market value of the partys business immediately prior to such sale or
(iii) the acquisition by any Person or group (including by way of a tender
offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the party or such Person or group),
directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire
beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty percent (50%)
of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
party.

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company; _provided, however_ , that after adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made
which by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time either party
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive 



 

68  compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder, including pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_,
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
applicable Law.

financial condition or results of operations of such entity taken as a whole
with its Subsidiaries, other than any Effect primarily resulting from (A)
changes in general economic or market conditions or Effects affecting the

its Subsidiaries as compared to other similarly situated participants in the

8.4 _Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a
particular section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed a disclosure in any other section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule to which the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is readily
apparent on its face.

8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original and one and the

waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that without the further approval of the
Companys stockholders, no such amendment or waiver that requires the approval
of the shareholders of the Company under Delaware Law shall be made or given
after the Shareholder Approval unless the required further approval is
obtained.



 

71 8.7 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule, (i) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all

with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in  _Section
5.10_.

8.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and
effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.9  _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof in addition to ay other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with
any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and covenants not
to assert or plead any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

8.11 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore,



 

72  waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

8.12 _Assignment_. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder

whole or in part, to any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time and,
after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
purported assignment in violation of this  _Section 8.12_ shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
