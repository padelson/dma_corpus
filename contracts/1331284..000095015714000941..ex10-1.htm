SECTION 4.03. No Conflicts; Consents. (a) The execution and delivery by
Purchaser of this Agreement does not and the consummation of the Acquisition

violation of any provision of, any Judgment or Applicable Law, in each case,
applicable to Purchaser or its properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the

SECTION 5.06. Continuing Operation of the Company and Employee Matters. (a)
Until the date that is two years after the Closing, Purchaser undertakes to
the Sellers to operate the Company as a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Purchaser, with its existing management and Employee team (subject always to
the terms of their respective New Service Contracts); provided, however, that
Purchaser shall be permitted to restructure its corporate organization
(including with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries) during such
period as necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection with tax,
financing or other structuring or planning activities or objectives as
reasonably determined by Purchaser in good faith, subject at all times to the

corporate group and the business of the Company continuing in the manner as at

all legally binding contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries as in effect on or immediately
prior to the Closing that are applicable to any current or former directors or
Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary. Employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary who remain employed by Purchaser or its subsidiaries following the
Closing shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility, participation and
vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement established or maintained by Purchaser for service
accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Closing with the Company or any
Subsidiary; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In
addition, Purchaser shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on
benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the same extent such
limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Purchaser or its
subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-
pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries in the calendar

continue the employment of any specific person (subject always to the terms of
the New Service Contracts). This Section 5.06 shall be binding and inure
solely to the benefit of each party to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Section 5.06, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person
any rights pursuant to this Section 5.06.

cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes, and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect
to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. After the Closing Date, Sellers
shall be granted access to the accounting and Tax records and information held
by the Company and the Subsidiaries to the extent such records and information
pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall, and
shall cause each Subsidiary to, (i) use its reasonable endeavors to properly
retain and maintain such records until such time as Sellers determine that
such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary and (ii) to allow
Sellers and their agents and representatives, at times and dates reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as Sellers may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at Sellers'
expense.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.08. Publicity. No public release or announcement concerning the

agreement with any applicable securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other parties
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; provided, however, that the Company and Purchaser may make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are consistent with the
parties' prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.09. Financing. Purchaser shall use its reasonable endeavors to
consummate one or more equity financings with aggregate net proceeds of not

foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required to sell any of its shares of common
stock at a price less than $7.50 per share as a result of this Section 5.09,
Section 5.04 or any other provision of this Agreement.

any party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions, as such other party may reasonably
deem necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.11. Company Assistance with Financing. The Company shall use its
reasonable endeavors to assist Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser
Equity Financing, including by delivering all financial information and
reports concerning the Company and the Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser and requesting its auditors to be available to and to
cooperate with Purchaser and its advisers and requesting its auditors to
provide customary "comfort letters" with respect to any financial information
of the Company and the Subsidiaries that is included in, or incorporated by

bear all costs, fees and expenses associated with any work undertaken by the
Company's auditors at the request of the Purchaser or its advisers in

(vii) to the extent any amount or liability in respect of such Relevant Claim
was provided for or reserved against in calculating the Actual Equity Amount,
but only to the extent of such provision or reserve.

  


 

  

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing
with respect to all Relevant Claims (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) shall, in each case, be an action in damages and
Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate or rescind this Agreement by
reason of any Relevant Claim or otherwise (other than in connection with
fraud). In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Company
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it may have against
Sellers arising under or based upon this Agreement (except pursuant to an
action in damages). After the Closing, Sellers shall not be entitled to
terminate or rescind this Agreement for any reason.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.02. Calculation of Value of Relevant Claim. (a) Subject to Section
8.02(b), the value of any Relevant Claim made by Purchaser shall include all
Losses arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of such Relevant
Claim, and shall include reasonable legal fees and expenses in connection
therewith; provided, however, that such legal fees and expenses shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether the thresholds in 8.01(c)(i)
and 8.01(c)(ii) have been satisfied. The value of any Relevant Claim made by
Purchaser shall be deemed to be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by
Purchaser or the Company as a result of any indemnification by a third party
or under insurance policies with respect to such related Relevant Claim.

  


 

  

(b) Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover under any Relevant Claim any
amounts that are in the nature of punitive, incidental, consequential,
special, treble or indirect damages or damages based on any multiple,
including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or
loss of business reputation or opportunity, in each case of any kind or
nature, regardless of the form of action through which any of the foregoing
are sought, except to the extent such punitive, incidental, consequential,
special, treble or indirect damages or damages based on any multiple are
payable to an unaffiliated third party by Purchaser or its affiliates.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the liability of
the Sellers under this Agreement and the value of any Relevant Claim
calculated in accordance with Section 8.02 shall not be increased as a result
of the Purchaser Equity Financing and nothing in this Agreement shall increase
the liability of the Sellers for any Relevant Claim beyond the amount for
which the Sellers would have been liable if Purchaser was not undertaking the
Purchaser Equity Financing.

  


 

  

(d) Subject always to the other provisions of this Agreement limiting the
liability of the Sellers, if the Purchaser establishes a valid Relevant Claim
with respect to the warranties in this Agreement (having regard to any
qualification or exception contained in such warranty relating to materiality
or "Company Material Adverse Effect"), then the value of that Relevant Claim
shall be deemed to be the full amount of such Relevant Claim and not just the
amount in excess of any materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
threshold deemed to apply to such warranty.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.03. Expiry of Sellers Liability for Relevant Claims. The Sellers'
liability for any Relevant Claim (including under Section 8.05) shall
terminate unless the Purchaser has delivered notice of such claim, stating in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim and Purchaser's reasonable estimate
of the Losses claimed, by no later than:

  


 

  

(a) in the case of any Relevant Claim under the warranties contained in this
Agreement (other than the warranties in Section 3.13, the Fundamental Company
Warranties or the Fundamental Seller Warranties), the date falling 18 months
after the Closing; and

  


 

  

(b) in the case of any other Relevant Claim (i.e., other than Relevant Claims
subject to Section 8.03(a)), the date falling five years after the Closing.

  


 

  

The parties agree that, after the dates set forth above, the Sellers'
liability for any Relevant Claim shall survive only in respect of, and only
until, the resolution of the matter the subject of the Relevant Claim detailed
in any notice served prior to the above dates.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.04. Procedures. (a) Third Party Claims. In order for Purchaser to be
entitled to recover for any Relevant Claim in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim made by, or any liability to, any third person (including
any Taxing Authority) against the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or
Purchaser (a "Third Party Claim"), Purchaser must notify the Sellers in
writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim promptly following
receipt by the Company or Purchaser of notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that, subject to Section 8.03, failure to give such
notification shall not affect the ability of Purchaser to recover for the
Relevant Claim provided hereunder except to the extent the Sellers have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, Purchaser shall
deliver to the Sellers, promptly following the Purchaser's or the Company's or
any Subsidiary's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Purchaser or the Company relating to
the Third Party Claim.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Tax is payable in respect of which
a claim could be brought under Section 8.05(a), the Sellers shall be entitled
to participate in the defense thereof and, if they so choose, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Sellers, so long as such counsel
is not reasonably objected to by the Purchaser or the Company. Should the
Sellers so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Sellers
shall not be liable to the Purchaser or the Company for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Purchaser or the Company in connection with the
defense thereof. If the Sellers assume such defense, the Purchaser or the
Company shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Sellers), at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Sellers, it being
understood that the Sellers shall control such defense. The Sellers shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Purchaser or the
Company for any period during which the Sellers have not assumed the defense
thereof. If the Sellers choose to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, the
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Sellers'
request) the provision to the Sellers of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Sellers
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Purchaser or the Company shall
not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the Sellers' prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Sellers assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Purchaser and the Company shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Sellers
may recommend and that by its terms obligates the Sellers to pay the full
amount of any final liability agreed between the Sellers and the relevant
third party in connection with such Third Party Claim and which releases the
Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries completely in connection with all
future liability for such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Sellers shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
incurred by the Purchaser and the Company in defending such Third Party Claim)
if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief
or relief for other than money damages against the Purchaser or the Company or
any Subsidiary that the Purchaser or the Company reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related
claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of
the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the
Sellers shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to
money damages.

  


 

  

(c) Mitigation. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is
liable to the other parties hereunder, including each agreeing to make
commercially reasonable endeavors to mitigate any loss suffered by it (or any
of its affiliates) or resolve any such claim or liability.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 8.05. Tax Allocation.

  


 

  

(a) Tax Allocation to Sellers. From and after Closing, each Seller shall,
subject to Section 8.05(d), pay to the Purchaser (or at the Purchaser's
direction to its affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries)) its
Respective Percentage of an amount equal to any Tax relating to the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries attributable to periods (or portions thereof) ending
on or before Closing; provided, however, that the Sellers shall not have any
obligation to make a payment under this Section 8.05(a) for Tax to the extent
such Tax:

  


 

  

(i) is provided for or reserved against in calculating the Actual Equity
Amount, but only to the extent of such provision or reserve;

  


 

  

(ii) is Tax arising (or increased) as a result of any change in the accounting
or Tax policies or practices of the Company or any Subsidiary introduced after
Closing (including any change in the accounting reference date);

  


 

  

(iii) is Tax which arises or is increased as a result of any default or delay
by the Company, the Purchaser or any of the Subsidiaries after Closing in
paying or satisfying any Tax or any breach by the same parties of this
Agreement after Closing; or

  


 

  

(iv) is Tax arising in any of the circumstances reflected in Sections
8.01(c)(iii) or (iv);

  


 

  

(v) is Tax which arises or is increased as a result of the Company losing or
ceasing to be entitled to benefit from the awarded Approved International
Shipping Enterprise (AIS) Incentive to the extent such loss or cessation of
entitlement is a direct result of the entry into of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (including Closing).

  


 

  

(b) Tax Allocation to Purchaser. Except to the extent taken into account in
the calculation of the Actual Equity Amount, from and after Closing, Purchaser
shall pay or, if applicable, reimburse the Sellers for any Taxes relating to
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries except to the extent that such Tax is
Tax in respect of which the Purchaser is entitled to receive a payment under
Section 8.05(a).

  


 

  

(c) Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility under this
Agreement with respect to Taxes (other than pursuant to this Section 8.05) may
overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this Section 8.05,
the provisions of this Section 8.05 shall govern. The limitations in Section
8.01 shall not apply to this Section 8.05 except as explicitly provided in
this Section 8.05, and no separate Relevant Claim shall be brought by the
Purchaser (otherwise than under Section 8.05(a)) in respect of Tax which is
payable by any of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(d) Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
8.05:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(i) Sections 8.01(a) and 8.01(b) shall apply to all claims made under this
Section 8.05; and

  


 

  

(ii) neither the Sellers (taken together) nor the Purchaser shall be liable
pursuant to Section 8.05(a) or Section 8.05(b), respectively, for any
individual item with respect to which the Loss suffered does not exceed
$25,000; provided, however, that if the cumulative Losses suffered by the
Purchaser or the Sellers (taken together) with respect to all items
disregarded pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.05(d)(ii)
equal or exceed $100,000, then the Sellers (taken together) or the Purchaser,
as the case may be, shall be liable for the total amount of all such Losses,
and all reasonable legal fees and expenses in connection therewith, pursuant
to Section 8.05(a) or Section 8.05(b), respectively, and not just the excess.

  


 

  

(e) Outstanding Tax Returns. From and after Closing, Purchaser and the Company
shall: (i) deal with all matters (including preparing and dealing with all
correspondence and any other documentation) relating to the Tax affairs of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries for any Tax period (or part period) ending
after Closing, (ii) afford the Sellers, if they so request, reasonable
opportunity to be involved in the conduct of the Tax affairs referred to in
this Section 8.05(e) and all outstanding matters (including preparing and
dealing with all correspondence and any other documentation) relating to the
Tax affairs of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for all Tax periods
ended on or before Closing to the extent such Tax affairs relate exclusively
to Taxes for which Sellers would be required to indemnify the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 8.05, and (iii) act in accordance with all reasonable
comments of the Seller in relation to the Tax affairs referred to in Section
8.05(e)(ii), including promptly supplying the Sellers with copies of any
material communications received from any Taxing Authority and any
communications or materials proposed to be sent to any Taxing Authority in
relation thereto (and affording the Sellers such access, including the taking
of copies, to such books, accounts, records and personnel, and such other
assistance, as the Sellers reasonably require for the purpose of enabling the
Sellers to exercise their rights in this Section 8.05(e)).

  


 

  

SECTION 8.06. No Liability of Company Directors and Employees. For the
avoidance of doubt, except in the case of fraud, the Sellers and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that no director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, Purchaser or Purchaser's affiliates shall incur any liability (in
their capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company,
Purchaser or Purchaser's affiliates) for any act or omission in the course of
negotiating this Agreement or, if applicable, in assisting with the
preparation of the Company Disclosure Letter, and to the extent any claim may
exist (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud), each of
the Sellers and Purchaser hereby waives any such right or claim.

parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing.

SECTION 9.07. Entire Agreement.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality
Agreement, along with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto,
constitute the whole and only agreement among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, whether oral
or in writing, among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.

  


 

  

(b) Each party hereto acknowledges that, in entering into this Agreement, it
is not relying upon any pre-contractual statement that is not set forth in
this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Confidentiality
Agreement, along with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, and that,
except in the case of fraud, no party hereto shall have any right of action
against any other party hereto arising out of or in connection with any pre-
contractual statement, except to the extent that such statement is repeated in

Agreement, along with the Schedules and Exhibits thereto.

Agreement becomes legally binding.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.08. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Applicable
Law, or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this Section 9.08 with respect thereto. Upon any
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. Enforcement; Arbitration. (a) The parties agree that irreparable

Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of Sellers or
Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
9.09 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction, and the party opposing such injunction or
injunctions hereby agrees that it shall not contest the amount or absence of
any such bond or other security requested or offered by the party seeking such
injunction or injunctions.

Commerce (the "ICC"), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference

three. Purchaser shall nominate one arbitrator and Sellers shall jointly
nominate one arbitrator in accordance with the ICC Rules, and the President of
the arbitral tribunal shall be jointly nominated by the two party-nominated
arbitrators. If the party-nominated arbitrators fail to jointly nominate the
President within 30 days of their confirmation as arbitrators, either of
Sellers or Purchaser may request the ICC International Court of Arbitration to

entered on any such award by any court having competent jurisdiction.

  


 

  

(d) In its award the arbitrators shall allocate, in their discretion, among
the parties to the arbitration all costs of the arbitration, including the
fees and expenses of the arbitrators and reasonable attorney's fees, costs and
expert witness expense of the parties.

relation to any court proceedings pursuant to subclause (a) or (c) above.

applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or
in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each
party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter

5

  |  |  

As soon as practicable after the delivery of the Draft Closing Statement to
the Sellers and the Purchaser in accordance with paragraph 1, and in any event
within 60 calendar days of such delivery (the "Review Period"), the Sellers
and the Purchaser shall review the Draft Closing Statement and each shall
inform the other in writing of what adjustments (if any) they each propose be
made to the Draft Closing Statement in order for the Draft Closing Statement
to comply with the provisions of this Schedule 3.

   
   |  |   
  

6

  |  

If neither the Sellers or the Purchaser proposes any adjustments to the Draft
Closing Statement in writing within the Review Period or each confirms to the
other that it has no adjustments to propose to the Draft Closing Statement
within the Review Period, the Draft Closing Statement and the amount of the
Actual Equity Amount specified in such Draft Closing Statement shall be the
Closing Statement and the Actual Equity Amount as determined respectively for
all purposes of this Agreement, shall be final and binding on the parties and
shall not be subject to question on any ground whatsoever.

   
   |  |   
  

7

  |  

If, during the Review Period, either the Purchaser or the Sellers give written
notice to the other(s) in accordance with paragraph 5 of adjustments proposed
to be made to the Draft Closing Statement or any item thereof (a "Disagreement
Notice"), and the other party agrees with all of the adjustments proposed,
such adjustments shall be included in the Draft Closing Statement and the
Draft Closing Statement (as so adjusted) and the amount of the Actual Equity
Amount specified in such Draft Closing Statement shall be the Closing
Statement and the Actual Equity Amount as determined respectively for all
purposes of this Agreement, shall be final and binding on the parties and
shall not be subject to question on any ground whatsoever.

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     

8

  |  

If any party does not agree with any of the adjustments proposed by any other
party in any Disagreement Notice within 30 calendar days of delivery to it of
a Disagreement Notice, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall agree in writing
(the "Joint Disagreement Notice") which aspects of the Draft Closing Statement
should be referred for determination to KPMG LLP or, if it is unable or
unwilling to act in such capacity, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or such other
accountants as shall be agreed in writing by Purchaser and Sellers (the
"Reporting Accountants"). The Joint Disagreement Notice shall set out each
party's objections and attach any such information and material as is
necessary to support such objections. Such matter or matters as set out in the
Joint Disagreement Notice (but no other matters) shall then be referred by the
Purchaser and the Sellers jointly to the Reporting Accountants for
determination.

   
---|--- 
   |  |   
  

9

  |  

If the Sellers and the Purchaser are unable to agree on the terms of the Joint
Disagreement Notice within 30 calendar days of delivery to the others of a
Disagreement Notice, any of the Sellers or the Purchaser may by notice to the
other parties require that the Draft Closing Statement be referred to the
Reporting Accountants (the "Appointment Notice").

   
   |  |   
  

10

  |  

The Reporting Accountants shall determine the dispute on the following basis:

   
   |  |   
   |  

(a)

  |  

the Reporting Accountants shall be instructed to notify the Sellers and the
Purchaser of their determination of any matter specified in the Joint
Disagreement Notice or (in the case where the parties are unable to agree on
the terms of the Joint Disagreement Notice) the Purchaser's Disagreement
Notice and/or the Sellers's Disagreement Notice within 30 calendar days of the
Joint Disagreement Notice or the Appointment Notice being served (as the case
may be);

   
   |  |   
   |  

(b)

  |  

each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall be entitled to make written
submissions to the Reporting Accountants, but subject thereto the Reporting
Accountants shall have power to determine the procedure to be followed in
relation to their determination;

   
   |  |   
   |  

(c)

  |  

in making their determination the Reporting Accountants shall act as experts
and not as arbitrators, their decision as to any matter of fact referred to
them for determination shall be final and binding in all respects on the
parties and shall not be subject to question on any ground whatsoever (save in
the event of manifest error (in which case the relevant part of their
determination shall be void and the matter shall be remitted to the Reporting
Accountants for correction)); and

   
   |  |   
   |  

(d)

  |  

the fees and expenses (including the cost of any value-added, sales or similar
Tax) of the Reporting Accountants shall be borne equally between the Purchaser
(on the one hand) and the Sellers (on the other hand).

   
   |  |   
  

11

  |  

The determination of the Reporting Accountants pursuant to paragraphs 8 to 11
shall:

   
   |  |   
   |  

(a)

  |  

be made in writing and delivered to the Sellers and the Purchaser; and

   
   |  |   
  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

      |  

(b)

  |  

unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Sellers and the Purchaser, include
reasons for each relevant determination.

   
---|---|--- 
   |  |   
  

12

  |  

The Purchaser and the Sellers shall enter into an appropriate form of
appointment of the Reporting Accountants as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within 10 Business Days) following the delivery of the Joint
Disagreement Notice or the Appointment Notice (as the case may be) and the
Purchaser and Sellers shall act reasonably in agreeing the terms and
conditions of such appointment, including in respect of fees and any
exclusions and limitations of liability where it can be reasonably
demonstrated that such terms and conditions reflect market standard provisions
for such appointments.

   
   |  |   
  

13

  |  

Following any determination by the Reporting Accountants pursuant to
paragraphs 8 to 11, the Purchaser and Sellers shall jointly incorporate into
and reflect in the Draft Closing Statement the matters determined by the
Reporting Accountants and the Draft Closing Statement (as so adjusted) and the
amount of the Actual Equity Amount stated in such Draft Closing Statement
shall be the Closing Statement and the Actual Equity Amount respectively for
all purposes of this Agreement and shall be final and binding on the parties
and shall not be subject to question on any ground whatsoever (save in the
event of manifest error (in which case the relevant part of the Reporting
Accountant's determination shall be void and the matter shall be remitted to
the Reporting Accountants for correction)).

   
   |  |   
  

14

  |  

Until the Actual Equity Amount has been determined pursuant to this Schedule
3, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall respectively:

   
   |  |   
   |  

(a)

  |  

co-operate with the Reporting Accountants and comply with their reasonable
requests made in connection with the carrying out of their duties under this
Schedule 3. In particular, the Purchaser shall, subject to reasonable notice,
make available during normal office hours to the Reporting Accountants all
books and records relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries as the
Reporting Accountants may reasonably request during the period from the
appointment of the Reporting Accountants down to the making of the relevant
determination; and

   
   |  |   
   |  

(b)

  |  

generally provide the Reporting Accountants with such other information and
assistance as they may reasonably require (including access to and assistance
at reasonable times from personnel employed by the Sellers, the Company or the
Purchaser, as the case may be).

   
   |  |   
  

15

  |  

Nothing in this Schedule 3 shall entitle a party or the Reporting Accountants
access to any information or document which is protected by legal professional
privilege or litigation privilege, provided that neither the Sellers nor the
Purchaser shall be entitled to refuse to supply such part or parts of
documents as contain only the facts on which the relevant claim or argument is
based.

   
   |  |   
  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     

16

  |  

Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, and shall procure and ensure that
its accountants and other advisers and the Reporting Accountants shall, keep
all information and documents provided to them pursuant to this Schedule 3
confidential and shall not use the same for any purpose, except for disclosure
or use in connection with the preparation of the Draft Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement, any Disagreement Notice, any Joint Disagreement Notice or
any Appointment Notice, the proceedings of the Reporting Accountants or
another matter arising out of this Agreement or in defending any claim or
argument or alleged claim or argument relating to this Agreement or its
subject matter. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not limit or
in any way restrict the disclosure or use by Purchaser or its affiliates of
the Audited Financial Statements or the Unaudited Financial Statements.
