SECTION 1.4       PURCHASE PRICE.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in consideration
of the consummation of the Transactions, Purchaser shall, in addition to
assuming the Assumed Liabilities, pay to Rexam PLC (on behalf of the Asset
Seller and the Company Shareholder) in cash $140,000,000 at Closing which amount
shall be increased or decreased at Closing to the extent that the Estimated Net
Asset Value is more or less than the Baseline Net Asset Value (the "Purchase
Price") and shall be further subject to adjustment under Section 1.5. The
Purchase Price shall be allocated between the Asset Purchase (the "Asset
Purchase Price") and the Share Purchase (the "Share Purchase Price") for all
purposes (including financial accounting and Tax purposes) as set forth on
Schedule 1.4. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, any
adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.4 or Section 1.5 shall be allocated to the
Share Purchase Price.

SECTION 1.5       NET ASSET VALUE ADJUSTMENT.

         (a) Two Business Days prior to the Closing, Rexam PLC shall provide
Purchaser with a certificate prepared in good faith of Rexam PLC's estimate of
the Net Asset Value of the Subject Companies (the "Estimated Net Asset Value")
as of the Closing. Net Asset Value calculations shall be prepared in accordance
with the Net Asset Value Calculation Schedule attached hereto as Schedule
1.5(a). For purposes of calculating the Estimated Net Asset Value, the parties
hereby agree that Rexam PLC shall use the Exchange Rate in effect as of two
Business Days prior to the Closing.

         (b) For the purpose of calculating the Closing Date Net Asset Value,
Rexam PLC and the Purchaser shall jointly conduct a physical inventory as of an
agreed upon date of the Subject Companies' raw materials, work in process and
finished goods which shall be valued at the lower of cost or market value
consistent with Rexam Accounting Policies with an appropriate


                                       7


<PAGE>


writedown of any damaged, obsolete or otherwise nonconforming raw materials,
work in progress and finished goods. Rexam PLC shall perform the remaining
calculations necessary to determine the Net Asset Value as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. As soon as practical following the Closing Date
and in any event within 30 days thereof, Rexam PLC shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a schedule showing Rexam PLC's calculation of the Net Asset Value as
of the Closing Date (the "Initial Net Asset Value Statement"). For purposes of
calculating the Initial Net Asset Value Statement, the parties hereby agree that
Rexam PLC shall use the Exchange Rate in effect as of the Closing Date as
determined in accordance with Rexam Accounting Policies.

         (c) Rexam PLC shall provide the Purchaser and its representatives with
full access to the work papers of Rexam PLC used to calculate the Initial Net
Asset Value Statement. If Purchaser disagrees with the Initial Net Asset Value
Statement, Purchaser shall notify Rexam PLC of such disagreement, setting forth
in detail the particulars of such disagreement within 15 days after its receipt
of the Initial Net Asset Value Statement. In the event of any such notice of
disagreement, the Purchaser and Rexam PLC shall use their reasonable efforts for
a period of 30 days to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation
of the Closing Date Net Asset Value (as defined below). If at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve any disagreements, Rexam PLC and Purchaser
shall select an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing
other than a firm that is the primary accountant for either Purchaser or the
Selling Parties (the "Accountants"), to resolve such disagreements. The
Accountants shall resolve as promptly as practicable any such disagreements
acting as experts and not as arbitrators. The determination of the Accountants
shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties. Rexam PLC and Purchaser shall share equally the fees and expenses
incurred by the Accountants in resolving such disagreements. The date of the
final resolution of the Net Asset Value as of the Closing Date shall be referred
to as the "Determination Date". The amount of the Net Asset Value as of the
Closing Date as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.5(c) is referred
to herein as the "Closing Date Net Asset Value".

         (d)      The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

               (i) Payment by Rexam PLC. If the Closing Date Net Asset Value is
          less than the Estimated Net Asset Value, Rexam PLC shall within five
          Business Days after the Determination Date pay to the Purchaser an
          amount equal to the Estimated Net Asset Value minus the Closing Date
          Net Asset Value.

               (ii) Payment by Purchaser. If the Closing Date Net Asset Value is
          greater than the Estimated Net Asset Value, Purchaser shall, within
          five Business Days after the Determination Date, pay to Rexam PLC an
          amount equal to the Closing Date Net Asset Value minus the Estimated
          Net Asset Value.

               (iii) Undisputed Amounts. If pursuant to Section 1.5(c) above,
          there is a dispute as to the final determination of the Closing Date
          Net Asset Value, Rexam PLC or Purchaser shall promptly cause to be
          paid to the other at the end of the 30-day period provided under
          Section 1.5(c) hereof for resolving any disagreements with respect to
          the


                                       8


<PAGE>


          calculation of the Closing Date Net Asset Value, such amounts as are
          not in dispute, pending final determination of such dispute pursuant
          to Section 1.5(c).

               (iv) Interest. Any adjustments in the Purchase Price hereunder
          shall bear interest from the Closing Date at the thirty-day Dealer
          Commercial Paper rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal (New York
          Edition) as of the interest calculation date.


                                   ARTICLE II

and, to the Selling Parties' Knowledge, the other parties thereto (ii) there is
not, and no Person has made any claim or allegation to any Subject Company or

<PAGE>


Company Material Adverse Effect; provided that, nothing contained in this

SECTION 3.20      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         (a) Schedule 3.20 hereto contains a true and complete list of all
Benefit Plans maintained by or on behalf of the Subject Companies relating to
the conduct of the Business. Rexam PLC has heretofore made available to
Purchaser a true and complete copy of each written Benefit Plan and any
amendments thereto and each agreement creating or modifying any related trust or
other funding vehicle.

         (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, to the extent that any
Benefit Plan is subject to United States laws:

               (i) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been
          incurred by a Subject Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
          satisfied in full.

               (ii) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any
          Title IV Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk
          that such proceedings will be instituted.

               (iii) No Title IV Plan is a "multi-employer pension plan," as
          defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Plan a plan
          described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

               (iv) Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
          accordance with its terms and applicable law, including ERISA and the
          Code, except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (v) Each Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
          meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified.

Company has been filed on a timely basis, and all such Tax Returns were correct
and complete in all material respects. All Taxes of the Acquired Company and all
VAT (sales tax) of the Asset Seller have been paid on a timely basis, whether or
not shown on the Acquired Company's or any Selling Party's Tax Returns, that
were due and payable. All Taxes that each Subject Company is or was required by
law to withhold or collect have been withheld or collected and, to the extent
required, have been paid on a timely basis to the proper Governmental Entity.

<PAGE>


         (b) The unpaid Taxes of each Subject Company for Tax Periods through
the date of the Interim Management Accounts do not exceed the accruals and
reserves for Taxes (excluding reserves for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the Interim
Management Accounts. All Taxes attributable to the period from and after the
date of the Interim Management Accounts and continuing through the Closing Date
are attributable to the conduct by each Subject Company of their respective
operations in the ordinary course of business. For purposes of determining the
amount of Taxes attributable to a specified period (e.g., the period from the
date of the Interim Management Accounts through the Closing Date) other than a
Tax Period, each Tax shall be computed as if the specified period were a Tax
Period.

         (c) The Acquired Company has delivered or made available to the
Purchaser correct and complete copies of all income Tax Returns, examination
reports, and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the
Acquired Company since 1997. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.21(c), no
examination or audit of any Tax Return of the Acquired Company or of any Selling
Party insofar as it relates to the Acquired Company by any Governmental Entity

contemplated. The Acquired Company does not have any outstanding issues pursuant
to notification by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that the
Acquired Company or any Selling Party insofar as it relates to the Acquired
Company was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. The Acquired
Company has no actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any Person (other
than the Acquired Company) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar or comparable provision of state, local or foreign law), or as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

         (d) No Subject Company has waived any statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes or agreed to an extension of time with respect to an assessment

power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted,

         Purchaser has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver

any Governmental Entity, (c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to

letter, credit rating letter, underwriting agreement or offering memorandum (the
"Financing Documents") relating to the Purchaser's plans at the date hereof to
secure the financing necessary to consummate the Transactions, including without
limitation, any plans to issue debt or equity securities in a private placement
which is exempt from registration under the Securities Act or to issue publicly
registered debt securities in exchange for privately issued debt securities.
Purchaser shall make available to the Selling Parties copies of each draft of
each Financing Document no later than five (5) Business Days (and the
substantially final draft of each such Financing Document no later than 24

of the Confidentiality Agreement and shall make any factual corrections in the
information regarding the Subject Companies that the Selling Parties indicate

investigation pending or, to Purchaser's Knowledge, threatened against Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries by or before any court or Governmental Entity that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have or would reasonably be expected to
impede the ability of Purchaser to complete the Closing in all material
respects.

         (a) Rexam PLC shall cause the Subject Companies prior to the Closing to
(i) give Purchaser and its authorized representatives reasonable access to all
books, records, personnel, offices and other facilities and properties of the
Subject Companies relating to the Business, (ii) permit Purchaser to make such
copies and inspections thereof as Purchaser may reasonably request and (iii)
cause the officers of the Subject Companies to furnish Purchaser with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the Business
and the properties of the Subject Companies as Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request; provided that any such access shall be conducted at
Purchaser's expense, at a reasonable time, under the observation of the Subject
Companies' personnel and in such a manner as to maintain the confidentiality of
this Agreement and the Transactions and not to interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Subject Companies or the Business.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other agreement
between Purchaser and any Selling Party executed prior to the date hereof,
neither Rexam PLC, the Subject Companies, nor any Affiliate of Rexam PLC shall
have any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its representatives, or
provide Purchaser or its representatives with, any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return filed by Rexam PLC or any of its Affiliates or their
respective predecessors, or any related material (provided, that all information
used in such Unitary Tax Return that pertains solely to the Subject Companies
shall be provided to the Purchaser). Nothing herein shall require any Selling
Party to disclose any information to Purchaser if such disclosure would
contravene any applicable laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to
which a Selling Party or any Affiliate of a Selling Party is a party but
excluding any legal restriction arising solely from the lack of written consent
from employees to Purchaser's review of their personnel data outside the
European Union).

         (b) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
binding and in full force and effect. The information contained herein, in the
schedules hereto or delivered to Purchaser or its authorized representatives
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to be Confidential Information (as defined and
subject to the exceptions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) until the
Closing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4, Purchaser shall cause its
consultants, advisors and representatives to treat the terms of this Agreement
after the date hereof as strictly confidential (unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or, based upon the advice of legal counsel,
by other requirements of law and then still subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent permitted by law).

SECTION 5.3       EFFORTS AND ACTIONS TO CAUSE CLOSING TO OCCUR.

         (a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, Purchaser and Rexam PLC shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done and cooperate with each other in order to do, all
things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable laws) to


                                       31


<PAGE>


consummate the Closing of the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including
the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to
be filed to consummate the Closing and the other Transactions and the taking of
such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, authorizations,
consents, orders, licenses, permits, qualifications, exemptions or waivers by
any third party or Governmental Entity. In addition, no party hereto shall take
any action after the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to materially
delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or
consent from any Governmental Entity or other Person required to be obtained
prior to Closing. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall require any Selling
Party to pay any consideration to any other Person from whom any such approvals,
authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits, qualifications, exemptions
or waiver is requested.

         (b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the
other party hereto with respect to, provide any necessary information with
respect to, and provide the other parties (or their respective counsel) with
copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party hereto shall promptly
inform each other party of any communication received by such party from any
Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Transactions, then
such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

         (c) In addition to and without limiting the agreements of the parties
contained above, Purchaser and Rexam PLC shall (i) take promptly all actions
necessary to make the filings required of them or any of their respective
Affiliates under the HSR Act and any Foreign Antitrust Law, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request for additional information or
documentary material received by Purchaser, Rexam PLC or any of their respective
Affiliates from the FTC, the DOJ or any Foreign Antitrust Administrator pursuant
to the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or from any state attorney general
or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, (iii)
cooperate with each other in connection with any filing under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Antitrust Law and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry concerning the Transactions commenced by the FTC, DOJ, any Foreign
Antitrust Administrator, any state attorney general or any other Governmental
Entity, (iv) use their best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may
be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any antitrust law and (v)
advise the other parties promptly of any material communication received by such
party from the FTC, DOJ, any Foreign Antitrust Administrator, any state attorney
general or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions, and
of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party
proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, DOJ, any Foreign Antitrust
Administrator, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. Concurrently with the filing of notifications
under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or as soon thereafter as
practicable, Rexam PLC and Purchaser shall each request early termination of the
HSR Act waiting period or any corresponding provision of any Foreign Antitrust
Law. With regard to Purchaser, "best efforts" for purposes of Section 5.3(c)(iv)
shall


                                       32


<PAGE>


not include (x) proffering Purchaser's willingness to accept an order providing
for the divestiture by Purchaser of such properties, assets, operations, or
businesses of Purchaser or the Business (as are necessary to permit Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions, including an offer to hold separate such
properties, assets, operations or businesses pending any such divestiture), or
(y) Purchaser's willingness to accept such other conditions, restrictions,
limitations, or agreements affecting Purchaser's full rights or ownership of the
Purchased Assets and the assets of the Acquired Company as may be necessary to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by the FTC, DOJ, any Foreign
Antitrust Administrator, any state attorney general or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to the Transactions under any antitrust law. Purchaser shall
engage appropriate experts with experience in antitrust matters to advise them
regarding any comments or objections or requests for additional information
received or anticipated from the FTC, DOJ, any Foreign Antitrust Administrator,
any state attorney general or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions. Purchaser shall consult regularly with the Selling Parties in
advance and from time to time regarding the conduct and status of any filings
with Governmental Entities and provide the Selling Parties with copies of such
filings in sufficient time for the Selling Parties to provide meaningful input
as to strategy and content (provided that Purchaser shall be entitled to redact
any of its confidential information contained in such filings before providing
copies to the Selling Parties) and any significant strategies, approaches or
other actions that Purchaser expects or intends to adopt or take in connection
therewith.

SECTION 5.4       PUBLICITY.

         From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or the date the
Transactions are terminated or abandoned pursuant to Article VII, neither Rexam
PLC, the Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other internal or external announcement
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without prior consultation
with Rexam PLC and Purchaser, except as legal counsel shall advise may be
required by law or by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange
or trading market and then only after Rexam PLC and Purchaser have been afforded
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the same.

SECTION 5.5       EMPLOYEES; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

         (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Active Employees"
shall mean each person employed by a Subject Company as of the Closing Time who
is performing work duties in connection with the Business for such Subject
Company or is absent from work (1) by reason of a scheduled day off; (2) by
reason of a sick day or a paid vacation day, personal day or holiday; (3) by
reason of a family or medical leave covered under Section 102 of the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993 or any comparable foreign law; or (4) due to any
short-term disability or other authorized leave or suspension under such Subject
Company's policies or practices. Purchaser shall, as of the Closing Time, offer
employment to all Active Employees of the Asset Seller who are not employed in
the United Kingdom. Such employment may be employment at will. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties intend that the contracts of employment of those Active
Employees of the Asset Seller who are employed in the United Kingdom and all
rights and duties and obligations of the Asset Seller thereunder shall be


                                       33


<PAGE>


automatically transferred to the Purchaser with effect from the Closing Time.
Active Employees of the Asset Seller who accept employment with Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) together with the Active Employees of the
Acquired Company are referred to collectively as "Continuing Employees." If any
Continuing Employee is discharged by Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliates, then
Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all severance costs for such
Continuing Employee under any severance benefit plan or arrangement maintained
or entered into by Purchaser, Purchaser's Affiliates or the Acquired Company.
Purchaser shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices or
payments due to any Continuing Employees, and all notices, payments, fines or
assessments due to any Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable foreign,
federal, state or local law, common law, statute, rule or regulation with
respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of the Continuing Employees,
including without limitation, the WARN Act, Section 4980B of the Internal
Revenue Code, Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended ("COBRA"), and any rules or regulations as have been issued in
connection with the foregoing. The Asset Seller acknowledges and assumes all
liabilities, if any, under any comparable foreign law with respect to all of its
employees as of the Closing Time who do not become Continuing Employees. The
Purchaser and the Asset Seller shall cooperate in signing and sending to each of
the Continuing Employees who were Active Employees employed in the United
Kingdom forthwith after the Closing Time a notice of transfer of employment in
the agreed form. The parties' cooperation in this respect shall not constitute
an admission that the other party has complied with its duties under Regulation
10 of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulation 1981.

         (b) From and after the Closing Time, Purchaser shall provide, or cause
to be provided, benefits for Continuing Employees who are covered by the
Collective Bargaining Agreements in accordance with the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements. Continuing Employees who are covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreements participate in one or both of (i) the Rexam Pension Plan
for Collectively Bargained Employees (the "Union Pension Plan") and (ii) the
Rexam Retirement Savings Plan for Collectively Bargained Employees (the "Union
401(k) Plan" and together with the Union Pension Plan, the "Union Qualified
Plans"). Continuing Employees participating in the Union Qualified Plans shall
terminate as participants and become fully vested in their accrued benefits
under such plans on the day prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall permit
any such employees who become Continuing Employees to directly roll over any
eligible rollover distributions from the Union Qualified Plans to a defined
contribution plan of Purchaser.

         (c) On and for a period of not less than one year following the
Closing, Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, welfare
benefits for Continuing Employees who are not covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreements that are substantially equivalent to the welfare benefits
provided to such employees under such benefit plans as Purchaser makes available
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser on the day prior to the Closing
Date ("Purchaser's Welfare Plans"), which benefits are described in Schedule
5.5(c), except as otherwise required under applicable law with respect to
Continuing Employees who are employed in the United Kingdom. Purchaser shall be
liable for and shall pay all health and dental care and short-term disability
benefits due and payable to or for the benefit of Continuing Employees under
Purchaser's welfare benefit plans with respect to claims incurred from and after


                                       34


<PAGE>


the Closing Date. Continuing Employees who are not covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreements shall receive service credit for their service with the
Subject Companies and their predecessors for purposes of participation and
vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes except to the extent required by
Section 5.5(f) below) under Purchaser's Welfare Plans (but only to the extent
such service was taken into account under the Benefit Plans made available to
the employees of the Subject Companies on the day prior to the Closing Date).
Purchaser shall provide that no additional waiting periods, deductibles,
exclusions or benefit limitations for pre-existing conditions shall be imposed
or assessed against such Continuing Employees (or their dependents) under
Purchaser's Welfare Plans (other than as would have been applicable to such
Continuing Employees or their dependents under the Benefit Plans made available
to the employees of the Subject Companies on the day prior to the Closing Date).
Purchaser shall provide that Purchaser's Welfare Plans shall recognize any
expenses paid by such Continuing Employees (or their dependents) which were
applied to meet deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limits under the Benefit
Plans for the calendar year of the Closing as if such expenses had been paid
under Purchaser's Welfare Plans for purposes of applying the deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limits of Purchaser's Welfare Plans for such calendar
year.

          (d) (i) The Acquired Company's employees who are not covered by
          the Collective Bargaining Agreements participate in one or more of:

                    (A) the Rexam Retirement Income Pension Plan (the "Salaried
               Pension Plan"); and

                    (B) the Rexam Retirement Savings Plan (the "Salaried 401(k)
               Plan" and together with the Salaried Pension Plan, the "Non-Union
               Qualified Plans").

          Acquired Company employees participating in the Non-Union Qualified
          Plans shall terminate as participants and become fully vested in their
          accrued benefits under such plans on the day prior to the Closing
          Date. Purchaser shall permit any such employees who become Continuing
          Employees to directly roll over any eligible rollover distributions
          from such plans to a defined contribution plan of Purchaser.

               (ii) Purchaser acknowledges that certain participants in the
          Salaried 401(k) Plan and the Union 401(k) Plan have loans outstanding
          thereunder, and to the extent permitted under the Code, Purchaser
          agrees to accept the notes evidencing such loans as part of any
          "eligible rollover distributions," as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of
          the Code, to a defined contribution plan of Purchaser, subject to such
          procedures as Purchaser may reasonably require. Within sixty (60) days
          following the Closing Date, the Selling Parties shall cause to be
          provided to Purchaser a list of such loans outstanding on the Closing
          Date.

         (e) Continuing Employees of the Acquired Company who are participants
in the medical care and dependent care spending account plan maintained by the
Selling Parties ("DSI's Spending Accounts") as of the day prior to the Closing
Date shall become participants in a substantially equivalent medical care and
dependent care spending account plan established for Continuing U.S. Employees
by Purchaser ("Purchaser's Spending Accounts"). Any elections


                                       35


<PAGE>


made by such Continuing Employees with respect to DSI's Spending Accounts shall
remain in effect and no change in elections shall be effected as a result of
such Continuing Employees' becoming participants in Purchaser's Spending
Accounts. Within fourteen (14) days following the Closing Date, the Selling
Parties shall cause Purchaser to be provided with information concerning the
amount elected by each Continuing Employee to be contributed to each of DSI's
Spending Accounts for the plan year of the Closing, the amount of all benefit
payments made on behalf of or to such Continuing Employees from DSI's Spending
Accounts for such plan year through the day prior to the Closing Date and the
outstanding balances in each of DSI's Spending Accounts for each Continuing
Employee as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall pay from
Purchaser's Spending Accounts all eligible expenses incurred during the plan
year of the Closing by Continuing Employees (whether before or after the Closing
Date) which are unpaid as of the day prior to the Closing Date in accordance
with the policies in effect with respect to Purchaser's Spending Accounts for
all participants.

         (f) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall adopt and
establish a post-retirement welfare benefits plan for the benefit of Continuing
Employees of the Acquired Company ("Purchaser's OPEB Plan") the terms and
provisions of which are substantially equivalent to the post-retirement welfare
benefits plan maintained immediately prior to the Closing by the Selling Parties
(or their ERISA Affiliate) for the benefit of such employees ("Rexam's OPEB
Plan"). Such Continuing Employees shall receive credit under Purchaser's OPEB
Plan for their service with the Acquired Company and its predecessors for
purposes of determining eligibility for post-retirement welfare benefits under
Purchaser's OPEB Plan and the amount or level of benefits under such plan. In
addition, Purchaser shall cause Purchaser's OPEB Plan to assume and fully
perform, pay and discharge all obligations and liabilities accrued through the
Closing under Rexam's OPEB Plan by (i) Continuing Employees of the Acquired
Company and (ii) all retired employees of the Acquired Company. Purchaser and
the Selling Parties acknowledge that the Selling Parties maintain a retiree
medical plan (the "Access 2000 Plan") for employees of the Acquired Company who
were first employed after December 31, 1992 (the "Access 2000 Participants").
Access 2000 Participants may purchase group medical coverage under the Access
2000 Plan following retirement, but receive no other employer-provided benefit
under the Access 2000 Plan. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be
obligated to adopt or establish any plan or program that provides access to
group medical coverage to any Access 2000 Participant or assume any liability or
obligation of the Selling Parties or the Acquired Companies under the Access
2000 Plan. On or within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
communicate the terms and conditions of Purchaser's OPEB Plan to all Active
Employees of the Acquired Company and all retired employees of the Acquired
Company who will be entitled to benefits under Purchaser's OPEB Plan.

         (g) Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, Schedule
5.5(g) hereto sets forth the parties' respective rights, liabilities and
obligations as they relate to the pension plans maintained by the Selling
Parties for Active Employees of the Asset Seller in the United Kingdom.

         (h) The Selling Parties shall be responsible for including annual bonus
plan awards with respect to full year performance by Continuing Employees as an
accrual in the calculations


                                       36


<PAGE>


of the Closing Date Net Asset Value, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the
payment of such awards, to the extent so accrued, in accordance with the terms
of such plans.

         (i) The Selling Parties shall take all actions that are necessary or
appropriate to ensure that Purchaser shall have no obligation or liability under
WARN or any comparable foreign law or otherwise with respect to any employees or
former employees of the Subject Companies whose employment is terminated prior
to the Closing Time and who are not Continuing Employees as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Purchaser shall take all such
actions to ensure that the Selling Parties have no such liability with respect
to Continuing Employees who are terminated by Purchaser or any of Purchaser's
Affiliates after the Closing Time, including, without limitation, providing to
such employees and former employees any notifications required by WARN in a
timely manner. Without prejudice to Section 2.4 of Schedule 5.5(g), the Selling
Parties shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and against any
liability incurred by Purchaser arising out of the termination of employment of
any of the Subject Companies' employees prior to the Closing Time and who are
not Continuing Employees; and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Selling Parties from and against any liability incurred by, or alleged to be an
obligation of, the Selling Parties arising out of the termination of employment
of a Continuing Employee by Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliates after the
Closing Time.

         (j) All information and records regarding employment and personnel
matters of Continuing Employees shall be transferred to Purchaser on the Closing
Date.

         (k) Subject to Section 5.5(n) hereof, the parties acknowledge and agree
that all obligations and liabilities of the Subject Companies to pay to certain
of their employees the "stay pay" and sale completion bonuses (including all
taxes and 401(k) contributions (for employees of the Acquired Company)
associated therewith) shall be the responsibility of the Selling Parties who
shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless for any and all such obligations and
liabilities of the Subject Companies referred to in this Section 5.5(k).

         (l) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Parties and their Affiliates and
their officers, directors and employees from and against any and all claims,
losses, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and
other liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of (i) all
salaries, wages, commissions, employee incentive or other compensation,
severance, personal leave, or vacation benefits of Continuing U.S. Employees
accrued but unpaid as of the Closing and taken into account in the determination
of Closing Date Net Asset Value, and (ii) the liabilities assumed by Purchaser
under this Section 5.5 or any failure by Purchaser to comply with the provisions
of this Section 5.5. In the event that after the Closing Date, Rexam PLC or any
Affiliate of Rexam PLC pays any claim made by a Continuing Employee for medical
or dental benefits or for workers' compensation, which claim is attributable to
events occurring from and after the Closing, Purchaser hereby acknowledges and
agrees that it shall reimburse Rexam PLC or its Affiliate within ten (10)
Business Days of delivery of notice of such payment.

         (m) From and after the Closing the Non-Union Qualified Plans and the
Union Qualified Plans shall be responsible for, and the Selling Parties shall
indemnify and hold


                                       37


<PAGE>


harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and their officers, directors and
employees from and against, any and all claims, losses, damages, costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and other liabilities and
obligations relating to or arising out of the participation in such plans by
Continuing Employees of the Acquired Company or the termination of such
participation as of the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, Benefit Plans
maintained by the Selling Parties (including without limitation the Access 2000
Plan) shall be responsible for all post-termination of employment medical,
dental and life insurance benefits for current and former employees of the
Acquired Company arising out of any Benefit Plan, and the Selling Parties shall
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and their officers,
directors and employees from and against any and all claims, losses, damages,
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and other
liabilities and obligations relating to post-termination of employment medical,
dental and life insurance benefits under any of the Benefit Plans. The preceding
sentence shall not apply to COBRA benefits to the Continuing Employees or to the
obligations and liabilities assumed by Purchaser's OPEB Plan pursuant to Section
5.5(f).

         (n) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither the
employment agreement of Denis Wolstenholme nor the letter agreement addressed to
Denis Wolstenholme dated April 12, 2000 shall be amended prior to the Closing.
The Selling Parties shall be responsible for including any "stay pay" and sale
completion bonus awards (including all taxes associated therewith) owing to
Denis Wolstenholme under such agreements as an accrual in the calculations of
the Closing Date Net Asset Value, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the
payment of such bonus in accordance with the terms of such agreements.

         (o) No Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of any
of the Subject Companies, any Affiliate of any of the Subject Companies (or
his/her spouse or beneficiary), or any other person not a party to this
Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim hereunder. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit only of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns in accordance with Section 10.5
hereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except with
respect to such successors or permitted assigns this Agreement is not intended
and shall not be construed for the benefit of any third party or any person not
a signatory hereto. In no event shall this Agreement constitute a third party
beneficiary contract.

SECTION 5.6       PRODUCT WARRANTY AND LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS.

         (a) As of the Closing Time, Purchaser shall assume and thereafter
discharge all responsibilities, liabilities and obligations of the Subject
Companies for Rework and Refunds (as hereafter defined) arising out of products
manufactured or shipped by the Subject Companies on or prior to the Closing Time
("Pre-Closing Products"); provided however, Purchaser shall assume no other
liability with respect to Pre-Closing Products, including without limitation,
any claims by third parties for special, consequential or punitive damages
arising out of sales of Pre-Closing Products. The Selling Parties shall have no
responsibility, obligation or liability for any products or finished goods
inventory manufactured after the Closing Time, all of which shall be the
responsibility, obligation and liability of Purchaser. The Selling Parties shall
provide Purchaser with a certificate promptly following the Closing setting
forth which roll numbers and sheet skid numbers constitute Pre-Closing Products.


                                       38


<PAGE>


         (b) The Selling Parties jointly and severally, agree to pay to
Purchaser the value for all Rework and the amount of all Refunds incurred or
granted by the Business during the period ending on the date which is ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date (the "Limitation Date"). The issuance of credit
memos and customer accommodations for any Rework or Refund and the payment of
any Refund shall conform to historical practices of the Business and shall be
for the Selling Parties' account. The Selling Parties shall have approval rights
with respect to any such credit or accommodation over Five Thousand Dollars
($5,000.00), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Within twenty (20)
days after the Limitation Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Selling Parties
written notice (the "Payment Notice") of the amount of Rework and Refunds which
it incurred on and prior to the Limitation Date. During the twenty (20) day
period following their receipt of the Payment Notice, the Selling Parties shall
be entitled to access to the books and records of the Business for the purpose
of verifying the amounts of Rework and Refunds; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be required to disclose
to the Selling Parties any information required under this Section 5.6(b), if
such disclosure would contravene any applicable laws, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement. The amount due hereunder by the Selling Parties to Purchaser shall be
paid to Purchaser within thirty (30) days following the Selling Parties' receipt
of the Payment Notice.

         (c) For purposes hereof:

               (i) "Rework" shall refer to Pre-Closing Products identified as
defective by customers of the Subject Companies in respect of the Business which
require replacement with a new production order. Rework shall be valued at the
cost to the Subject Companies of direct materials, labor, manufacturing overhead
and freight; and

                  (ii) "Refunds" shall mean refunds given to customers of
the Subject Companies in respect of the Business for defective Pre-Closing
Products which do not require replacement with a new production order, which
refunds shall be in amounts equal to the original sales price (including
applicable freight) and which shall be given in accordance with such Subject
Company's prior refund policies.

         (d) All amounts due from the Selling Parties to Purchaser under this
Section 5.6 shall be reduced from time to time by the salvage value or other
value recovered by Purchaser from any Pre-Closing Products with respect to which
Rework or Refunds are provided hereunder. Purchaser shall grant credits and pay
refunds to customers in a manner consistent with the pre-Closing conduct of the
Business by the Subject Companies. The Selling Parties shall be entitled to
audit such payments to confirm the amounts actually paid and the reasons for
payment, provided that such audit shall be on reasonable notice and during
normal business hours and is conducted so as to not unreasonably interfere with
Purchaser's business.

SECTION 5.7       INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS.

         Except as provided in Sections 5.12, 5.14 and 5.15 or as otherwise
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, all agreements and commitments,
whether written, oral or otherwise, relating to the conduct of the Business
which are solely between a Subject Company,


                                       39


<PAGE>


on the one hand, and Rexam PLC and any of its Affiliates (excluding agreements
between the Acquired Company), on the other hand, shall be terminated and of no
further effect, simultaneously with the Closing without any further action or
liability on the part of the parties thereto.

SECTION 5.8       MAINTENANCE OF BOOKS AND RECORDS.

         Each of the parties hereto shall preserve, until at least the eighth
anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records possessed or to be
possessed by such party relating to the Business. After the Closing Date and up
until at least the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date, upon any reasonable
request from a party hereto or its representatives, the party holding such
records shall (a) provide to the requesting party or its representatives
reasonable access to such records during normal business hours and (b) permit
the requesting party or its representatives to make copies of such records, in
each case at no cost to the requesting party or its representatives (other than
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); provided that nothing herein shall
require either party to disclose any information to the other if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene any
applicable law. Such records may be sought under this Section for any reasonable
purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection with the
audit, accounting, tax, litigation, federal securities disclosure or other
similar needs of the party seeking such records. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any and all such records may be destroyed by a party if such destroying party
sends to the other parties hereto written notice of its intent to destroy such
records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be
destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 30th day following such
notice unless the other party hereto notifies the destroying party that such
other party desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event the
destroying party shall transfer the records to such requesting party and such
requesting party shall pay all reasonable expenses of the destroying party in
connection therewith.

SECTION 5.9       ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

         (a) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, including
without limitation, the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18
hereof and the provisions of Article X hereof, the responsibilities of the
parties in respect of environmental matters relating to the Asset Seller's Real
Property referenced on Schedule 1.2(a)(i) hereto shall be governed by Schedule
5.9(a) hereto.

         (b) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, including
without limitation, the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18
hereof and the provisions of Article X hereof, the parties agree that the
responsibility of the parties in respect of any investigation, clean-up,
remediation and/or monitoring activities related to environmental conditions
("Environmental Activities") that are (A) set forth on Schedule 5.9(c), (B)
determined within three (3) years from the Closing Date to have been created by
the Acquired Company at its facility in Lowville, New York (the "Lowville Site")
during the period from February 28, 1998 through the Closing Date or (C)
determined within three (3) years from the Closing Date to have been present as
of the Closing Date at any of the Acquired Company's facilities in South Hadley,
Massachusetts; Brownville, New York; West Springfield, Massachusetts; Johnston,


                                       40


<PAGE>


Rhode Island; or Reading, Pennsylvania, (the "Other Sites" and together with the
Lowville Site, the "US Sites") shall be governed by this Section 5.9. The
parties agree and acknowledge that nothing set forth in this Section 5.9 shall
be construed as to invalidate, annul, amend or alter Purchaser's
responsibilities with respect to the Acquired Company's facility in Lowville,
New York as set forth in that certain Landlord Estoppel dated as of February 20,
1998 by and between Purchaser and the Acquired Company (as successor in interest
to Pajco Products, L.P.).

         (c) Schedule 5.9(c) sets forth a list of Environmental Site Assessment
Reports that identify certain Recognized Environmental Conditions for which the
Selling Parties shall be responsible for payment of 100% of the actual costs of
all Environmental Activities related to or arising from such condition (the
"Existing RECs").

         (d) In the event that written notice is delivered to the Selling
Parties within three (3) years from the Closing Date, which notice states either
that (A) a Recognized Environmental Condition was caused by the Acquired Company
during the period from February 20, 1998 through the Closing Date at the
Lowville Site or (B) a Recognized Environmental Condition existed as of the
Closing Date on an Other Site but was not listed in the Environmental Site
Assessment Reports listed on Schedule 5.9(c) (an "Unknown REC" and together with
the Existing RECs, the "Covered RECs"), the parties agree to allocate the actual
costs of any Environmental Activity related to such Unknown REC in accordance
with the following (such allocation to be based on the date on which written
notice of the Unknown REC is delivered to the Selling Parties and not on the
date on which the work is actually performed):

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
              Notice Delivered                Selling Parties       Purchaser
              <S>                                      <C>             <C>
              Within one year                          100%             0%
              Within two years                          75%            25%
              Within three years                        50%            50%
</TABLE>

The actual costs of a party shall only include third party costs and shall not
include any costs attributable to a party's employees or management or any
allocation of overhead. Purchaser agrees to reimburse the Selling Parties in the
event that the results of Environmental Activities related to an Unknown REC
reveal that the Recognized Environmental Condition was not present at such US
Site as of the Closing Date. Except for any Existing REC and for any
Environmental Activity relating to an Unknown REC for which written notice has
been delivered to the Selling Parties prior to the end of three years from the
Closing Date, the Selling Parties shall have no responsibility for the payment
or the performance of any Environmental Activity after three years from the
Closing Date.

         (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the calculations used to
determine the Closing Date Net Asset Value shall not include any reserves for
any Environmental Activity for US Sites.

         (f) The Selling Parties shall have the initiative in carrying out any
Environmental Activity relating to an Existing REC. The Selling Parties shall
also have the initiative in carrying out the Environmental Activities relating
to any Unknown REC about which the Selling Parties


                                       41


<PAGE>


received written notice of within two years following the Closing Date. The
Selling Parties shall decide the approach and pace of such activities, subject
to the limits stated herein. The Selling Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the Environmental Activities within two years
from the date hereof (or the date of any subsequently delivered notice regarding
an Unknown REC), and whether or not such activities are completed during the two
year period, shall diligently pursue such activities during such two year period
and thereafter as required to complete the activities. The Purchaser shall have
the initiative in carrying out Environmental Activities for any Unknown REC for
which the Selling Parties are notified after the date which is the second
anniversary of the Closing Date. As used herein, the term "Control Party" shall
mean the party which has the initiative in carrying out an Environmental
Activity in respect of a Covered REC.

         (g) The Control Party shall determine in consultation with the
non-Control Party, whether applicable Law requires that any Covered REC be
reported to a Governmental Entity charged with protecting the environment (an
"Agency Notification"). To the extent an Agency Notification of a Covered REC is
required, then the Control Party shall: (i) make such Agency Notification, (ii)
perform, or cause to be performed, the appropriate Environmental Activity, and
(iii) obtain the written concurrence of the appropriate Governmental Entity that
no further action is necessary in respect of such Covered REC; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 5.9(g) shall prohibit a party having a
reporting obligation pursuant to any law from fulfilling such obligation.

         (h) In the event an Agency Notification of a Covered REC is not
required by applicable law, then the Control Party shall perform, or cause to be
performed, the related Environmental Activity until such time as its
environmental consultant delivers a reliance letter to the non-Control Party, in
substantially the form of Exhibit 5.9(h) hereto, which indicates that, in such
consultant's opinion, no further action is necessary; provided, however, in the
event that a Governmental Entity subsequently determines that additional
Environmental Activities relating to the Covered REC are required, then the
parties shall resume sharing costs consistent with this Section 5.9 as if the
consultant had never delivered said reliance letter.

         (i) The Selling Parties shall not consent to any institutional control,
restriction or use limitation (individually or collectively, an "Imposition")
with respect to the US Sites in connection with obtaining the no further action
determination required in Section 5.9(g) unless the Selling Parties shall have
first consulted with the Purchaser regarding such Imposition and first obtained
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed unless it would materially impair the continued
operations of the Acquired Company or anticipated future industrial use of the
Real Property. The Purchaser shall promptly execute such documents identified by
the Selling Parties as reasonably necessary to effectuate an Imposition which is
imposed in accordance with the terms hereof.

         (j) To the extent the Selling Parties are the Control Party, then the
parties agree to the following:

               (A) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
          Purchaser hereby grants the Selling Parties and their authorized
          employees, agents, representatives, consultants, contractors and
          subcontractors, (collectively the


                                       42


<PAGE>


          "Representatives") a license to enter the US Sites at reasonable times
          after providing notice for the purpose of performing the Environmental
          Activities at the US Sites. Purchaser further grants to the Selling
          Parties a license to place, store and operate all equipment necessary
          for the Environmental Activities; provided that such placement,
          storage and operation shall remain no longer than necessary and
          complies with all applicable laws and regulations and do not
          materially interfere with or disrupt Purchaser's operations.

               (B) For each phase of Environmental Activities, the Selling
          Parties shall provide to Purchaser reasonable advance notice (not less
          that 3 days) that the Selling Parties or Representatives will commence
          that phase of the Environmental Activities at the US Site. The notice
          to be provided by the Selling Parties shall generally describe the
          phase and nature of the Environmental Activities which the Selling
          Parties propose to commence and shall detail, to the extent the
          Selling Parties are able, the amount of space which the Selling
          Parties anticipate that will be needed to place, store and/or operate
          equipment necessary for the Environmental Activities and any other
          needs for the operation and/or conduct of the Environmental
          Activities. For each phase of the Environmental Activities, the
          Selling Parties and the Representatives shall not materially interfere
          with the use of the US Sites by Purchaser.

               (C) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Selling Parties
          in performing the Environmental Activities, including, without
          limitation, providing space at the US Sites for the installation and
          operation of any system necessary to implement such Environmental
          Activities. Selling Parties shall obtain all permits or approvals
          necessary to perform the Environmental Activities. To the extent
          available, Purchaser shall allow the Representatives to use existing
          utilities, including, without limitation, water and electrical power
          necessary to operate such systems, provided, however, that the Selling
          Parties shall reimburse Purchaser for such utility expenses to the
          extent they can be reasonably ascertained.

               (D) The Selling Parties shall indemnify Purchaser for all
          injuries or claims resulting from or relating to the actions conducted
          by the Selling Parties pursuant to this Section 5.9(j).

         (k) The Control Party shall provide to the non-Control Party copies of
all correspondence between the Control Party and any Governmental Entity
concerning the Environmental Activities or other matters related to this Section
5.9, and all measurements, data, samplings, analysis and/or other materials
resulting from, or produced pursuant to, the Environmental Activities as soon as
the same are available to the Control Party.

         (l) The parties agree to cooperate reasonably with each other, directly
and through their respective consultants, to effect the successful completion of
the Environmental Activities. However, subject to the Control Party's
obligations to communicate with and receive consents or approvals from the
non-Control Party as provided herein, the parties agree that the Control Party
shall reasonably control and lead the Environmental Activities and shall
coordinate all communications with any authority regarding the same. The
non-Control Party shall not


                                       43


<PAGE>


communicate with any Governmental Entity regarding the Environmental Activities
or the Covered RECs without the prior notice to, consultation with and obtaining
the consent of the Control Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and without allowing the Control Party to participate in and lead any
such communications.

         (m) Following Closing and for three (3) years thereafter, Purchaser may
not instigate, initiate or cause any other Person to initiate, any investigative
or remedial action relating to the US Sites unless (i) Purchaser gives the
Selling Parties no less than thirty (30) days advance written notice that it has
reasonably determined such action is required by an applicable Environmental
Law, or (ii) such action is required by Purchaser's lender, by a purchaser of
such US Site or the business conducted there, in connection with a third party
claim or when the outcome of an environmental audit performed by the Purchaser
in accordance with this Section indicates that such action is warranted. Any
investigation or remediation conducted by Purchaser during such period shall be
conducted so as to achieve a no further action determination by the Control
Party's consultant or appropriate Governmental Entity, as the case may be,
consistent with the then existing or anticipated future industrial use of the
Real Property.

SECTION 5.10      ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS.

         The assignment of any Contract, Lease, Governmental Permit or other
asset to be assigned to Purchaser pursuant to the provisions hereof shall not
constitute a contract to assign the same to the extent that an attempted
assignment would constitute a breach thereof or give rise to any right of
acceleration or termination. The Selling Parties shall use their reasonable
efforts to procure consents to any such assignment; provided, however, that the
Selling Parties' refusal to provide economic incentives to induce consent to
such assignment or their failure to commence litigation to compel consent to
such assignment shall not be deemed to be a failure by Rexam PLC to use
reasonable efforts to secure such consent. If any such consent is not obtained,
the Selling Parties shall cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement
designed to provide Purchaser the benefit of any such Contract, Lease,
Governmental Permit or other asset, including the enforcement of any and all
rights of any Selling Party against the other party thereto arising out of
breach or cancellation thereof by such party or otherwise. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, the parties agree that the procurement of the
Deed of Consent in respect of the Lease dated 22 August 2000 between Jeffrey
Gaskell and Rexam CFP Limited shall be governed by the provisions of Schedule
5.10.

SECTION 5.11      COOPERATION IN LITIGATION.

         Each party will cooperate with the other in the defense or prosecution
of any litigation or proceeding already instituted or which may be instituted
hereafter against or by such party relating to or arising out of the conduct of
the Business prior to the Closing Time (other than litigation arising out of the
Transactions). The party requesting such cooperation shall pay the out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) of the party
providing such cooperation and of its employees and agents reasonably incurred
in connection with providing such cooperation, but shall not be responsible to
reimburse the party providing such cooperation for the salaries or costs of
fringe benefits or other similar expenses paid by the party providing such
cooperation to its employees and agents while assisting in the defense or
prosecution of any such litigation or proceeding.


                                       44

SECTION 5.12      TRANSITIONAL SERVICES.

         The parties acknowledge that certain of the Subject Companies (i)
participate in Rexam PLC's wide area network, (ii) utilize the payroll services
of Rexam Inc., which is an Affiliate of Rexam PLC and the Subject Companies,
(iii) utilize information technology services in Bolton, Lancashire provided by
an Affiliate, (iv) utilize office and research and development space and
equipment in South Hadley, MA owned by an Affiliate, (v) utilize services of
Rexam Japan for sales support in Japan and (vi) utilize office space in Hong
Kong owned by Rexam Asia HK Limited. The parties hereto agree to provide, or
cause to be provided, these aforementioned services for up to a one-year period
after the Closing pursuant to a mutually satisfactory Transitional Services
Agreement (the "Transitional Services Agreement").

SECTION 5.13      INSURANCE.

               (a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that effective with the
          Closing all Insurance Policies provided to the Subject Companies by
          Rexam PLC or any Affiliate of Rexam PLC shall terminate and no further
          liability shall arise under any of such policies except that the
          Acquired Company and the Purchaser, as successor owner of the
          Purchased Assets, shall have the economic benefits of coverage under
          such policies with respect to insured events occurring before the
          Closing. With respect to any insured claims made before the Closing
          (or made after the Closing under occurrence policies), Purchaser shall
          bear the economic burden of any deductibles or self-insured retention.

               (b) Rexam PLC and Purchaser agree that all claims with respect to
          insured events occurring prior to the Closing shall be administered in
          accordance with the terms of the policies applicable to such claims.
          Such presently pending claims are listed on Schedule 5.13. Rexam PLC
          shall file all claims known to it prior to the expiration dates of all
          policies. Purchaser shall cooperate fully with Rexam PLC to enable
          Rexam PLC to comply with the requirements of the relevant insurance
          carrier and Purchaser shall provide such information and assistance as
          Rexam PLC may reasonably request in connection with any such claim.
          Any monies received by Rexam PLC or any Affiliate of Rexam PLC as a
          result of such a claim shall be promptly paid over to Purchaser.

               (c) Rexam PLC shall be responsible for all personal injury and
          workers compensation claims made prior to the Closing and for all
          workers compensation claims made after the Closing based upon
          incidents which occurred prior to the Closing.

SECTION 5.14      HEDGING CONTRACTS.

         Any foreign exchange hedging contract or forward euro contract set
forth in Schedule 5.14 held by or for the benefit of a Subject Company in the
operation of the Business shall continue in effect after the Closing until the
termination of said contract in accordance with its terms the provisions of
Section 5.7 notwithstanding.


                                       45


<PAGE>


SECTION 5.15      INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES.

         Except as set forth on Schedule 5.15 or as to any balance arising from
the intercompany supply of goods or services (trading balances) which has been
determined based on the Rexam Accounting Policies, all receivables and payables
between Rexam PLC or any Affiliate of Rexam PLC (other than the Subject
Companies), on the one hand, and either Subject Company, on the other hand,
shall be cancelled as of the Closing Date without payment and, to the extent it
represents indebtedness of the Acquired Company or of an Affiliate of Rexam PLC
domiciled in the United States, the amount of such cancellation shall be treated
as a contribution to capital prior to Closing.

SECTION 5.16      UPDATING SCHEDULES.

         The Selling Parties shall be entitled to update, amend or modify the
schedules to this Agreement after the date hereof to the Closing Date (the
"Update Period") to reflect factors, circumstances or events first arising or,
in the case of representations given to the Selling Parties' Knowledge, becoming
known to the Selling Parties during the Update Period by providing Purchaser
with written notice setting forth the proposed update and specifying the
schedule or schedules to be updated thereby; provided, however, that if any such
Schedules are updated, amended or modified in a manner that discloses any matter
or circumstance that has or could reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate with all prior updates, amendments or
modifications made to the Schedules pursuant to this Section 5.16, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, Purchaser may immediately terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f). To the extent any such update causes a Subject
Company to incur a Loss and Purchaser does not elect to terminate this
Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to seek indemnification for such Loss
pursuant to Article X hereof.

SECTION 5.17      NAME CHANGE.

         Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it shall have no rights in the name
"Rexam" or "Bowater" and covenants that it shall cause the Acquired Company to
change its corporate name within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date to a
corporate name that does not include the word "Rexam" or "Bowater" or any
similar words that would raise a reasonable likelihood of confusion with those
terms.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                   CONDITIONS

consummation of the Closing; provided that the parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to have any such order or injunction vacated or

as of a specified date, only as of such date) (i) after giving effect to any
materiality qualifications contained in particular representations and
warranties, and (ii) without giving effect to any such particular materiality
qualifications but after giving effect to a single materiality qualification
which states that all matters which would cause particular representations and
warranties to be inaccurate (if one did not give effect to such particular
materiality qualifications) shall be disregarded if all such inaccuracies in the
aggregate do not have a Company Material Adverse Effect).

         (b) Breach by the Selling Parties. No Selling Party shall have failed
to perform in any material respect any obligation or to comply in any material
respect with any covenant to be performed or complied with by it under this
Agreement.

         (d) By Rexam PLC if Purchaser shall have breached in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements

such breach;

         (e) By Purchaser if a Selling Party shall have breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in

         (f) By Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.16; or

         Rexam PLC agrees to indemnify the Purchaser and the Acquired Company
from and against their allocable portion of any Taxes, interest on Taxes or Tax
penalties, which they may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in

SECTION 8.3       RETURNS FOR PERIODS THROUGH THE CLOSING DATE.

         Rexam, Inc., an Affiliate of the Selling Parties, will include the
income of the Acquired Company (including any deferred income triggered into
income by IRS Reg. Section 1.1502-13 and IRS Reg. Section 1.1502-14 and any
excess loss accounts taken into income under IRS Reg. Section 1.1502-19) on
Rexam Inc.'s consolidated federal and state income and franchise Tax Returns for
all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal and state income and
franchise Taxes attributable to such income. Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Company to furnish Tax information to Rexam PLC or an Affiliate of Rexam PLC for
inclusion in any consolidated income or franchise Tax Return of Rexam PLC or an
Affiliate of Rexam PLC for the period which includes the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Acquired Company. The income
of the Acquired Company will be apportioned to the period up to and including
the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of
the Acquired Company as of the end of the Closing Date (subject to adjustments
required because of any post-Closing Purchase Price adjustments). Rexam PLC
shall indemnify the Purchaser and the Acquired Company in respect of, and hold
the Purchaser and the Acquired Company harmless against, all Taxes of the
Acquired Company with respect to any taxable period, or portion of a Straddle
Period as defined in Section 8.5(a) below, ending on or before the Closing Date
to the extent such Taxes exceed the accruals or reserves for taxes set forth in
the Closing Date Net Asset Value.

SECTION 8.4       AUDITS.

         Subject to Section 5.2(a) hereof, Rexam PLC will allow Purchaser and
its counsel to participate at its own expense in any audits of a consolidated
income Tax Return of Rexam PLC or an Affiliate of Rexam PLC to the extent that
such return relates to the Acquired Company. Rexam PLC will cause such Affiliate
to not settle any such audit in a manner which would adversely affect the
Acquired Company after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Purchaser. Purchaser will allow Rexam PLC and its counsel to participate at its
own expense in any audits of a sales and use Tax Return of Purchaser or the
Acquired Company to the extent that such return relates to the Acquired Company.

SECTION 8.5       TAXES RELATED TO THE ASSET SELLER.

         (a) The Asset Seller shall be liable for and pay all corporation Taxes
(whether assessed or unassessed) applicable to the Business of the Asset Seller
and the Purchased Assets, in each case attributable to taxable years or periods
ending prior to the Closing Time and, with respect to any taxable year or period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Time (a "Straddle Period"), the
portion of such Straddle Period ending at the Closing Time; provided, however,
that no Selling Party shall be liable for or pay any accrued Taxes assumed by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) or any other Taxes for which Purchaser
is liable under this Agreement. Purchaser shall be liable for and shall pay all
Taxes (whether assessed or unassessed) applicable to the Business of the Asset
Seller, the Purchased Assets and the


                                       50


<PAGE>


Assumed Liabilities that are attributable to taxable years or periods beginning
after the Closing Time and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Time; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall not be liable for or pay any Taxes for which the Asset Seller is
liable under this Agreement; including without limitation, pursuant to the
preceding sentence or Section 3.21. For purposes of this Section 8.5, any
Straddle Period shall be treated on a "closing of the books" basis as two
partial periods, one ending at the Closing Time.

         (b) The Asset Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall provide
reimbursement for any Tax paid by one party, all or a portion of which is the
responsibility of the other party, in accordance with the terms of this Section
8.5. Not later than 30 days prior to the payment of any such Tax, the party
paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party of the Tax payable and the
portion which is the liability of each party, although failure to do so will not
relieve the other party from its liability hereunder.

         (c)      Value Added Tax

               (i) Rexam PLC and the Purchaser intend that Article 5 of the
          Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995 shall apply to the
          sale of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement and agree to use all
          reasonable endeavours to secure that the sale is treated as neither a
          supply of goods nor a supply of services under that article.

               (ii) If nevertheless any VAT is payable on the sale of the
          Purchased Assets under this Agreement, then the Purchaser shall pay to
          Rexam PLC the amount of that VAT (plus any interest or penalties
          imposed by HM Customs & Excise ("Customs")), following the issue by
          Rexam PLC of a proper VAT invoice in respect of that VAT to the
          Purchaser.

               (iii) Without limiting Section 8.5(c)(ii), where Customs agrees
          to give a ruling on the VAT treatment of the sale of the Purchased
          Assets, VAT shall be treated as payable if Customs rule that it is
          payable. Before sending any relevant letter (or other communication)
          to Customs, Rexam PLC shall give the Purchaser a reasonable
          opportunity to comment on it, and shall make such amendments as the
          Purchaser reasonably requires.

               (iv) In determining its obligations under subsections 8.5(c)(i)
          and 8.5(c)(ii) the Purchaser is entitled to assume that no election to
          waive exemption from VAT has been made with respect to any Real
          Property or Lease and that the Real Property or Lease does not fall
          within paragraph (a) of item 1 of Group 1 of Schedule 9 to the Value
          Added Tax Act 1994 (freehold transfer of new or uncompleted building
          or civil engineering work). Accordingly:

                    (A) notwithstanding subsection 8.5(c)(i), the Purchaser is
               not obliged to make any election to waive exemption; and


                                       51


<PAGE>


                    (B) notwithstanding subsection 8.5 (c)(ii), the Purchaser is
               not liable to pay any amount in respect of VAT which would not
               have arisen but for the making of an election to waive exemption
               or but for the supply of a Real Property or Lease falling within
               paragraph (a) of that item 1.

               (v) Rexam PLC and the Purchaser intend that s. 49 of the Value
          Added Tax Act 1994 shall apply to the sale of the Purchased Assets
          under this Agreement and accordingly:

                    (A) Rexam PLC shall on or promptly following the Closing
               Date deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser all
               records referred to in s. 49;

                    (B) Neither the Asset Seller nor Rexam PLC shall make any
               request to Customs for those records to be preserved by the Asset
               Seller or Rexam PLC rather than the Purchaser;

                    (C) the Purchaser shall ensure that it is registered for VAT
               prior to the Closing Date;

                    (D) the Purchaser warrants that the Purchased Assets are to
               be used by the Purchaser in carrying on the same kind of business
               as that carried on by the Asset Seller;

                    (E) the Purchaser shall preserve those records for such
               period as may be required by law and during that period permit
               the Asset Seller and Rexam PLC reasonable access to them to
               inspect or make copies of them;

                    (F) the Purchaser may fulfill its obligations under
               paragraph (E) by procuring that a future transferee of the
               Business or any other person preserves the records and permits
               reasonable access as mentioned in that paragraph, in which case
               the Purchaser shall notify Rexam PLC of the name of that person;
               and

                    (G) Rexam PLC (or any person for the time being nominated
               under this paragraph) may by written notice to the Purchaser
               nominate another person for the purposes of paragraphs E and F of
               this subsection 8.5(c)(vi), in which case the reference in that
               paragraph to Rexam PLC shall be read as a reference to the person
               nominated.

               (vi) If the Purchaser pays Rexam PLC an amount in respect of VAT
          under subsection 8.5(c)(ii) above and Customs note that all or part of
          it was not properly chargeable, Rexam PLC shall repay the amount or
          relevant part of it to the Purchaser. Rexam PLC shall make the
          repayment promptly after the ruling, unless it has already accounted
          to Customs for the VAT. In that case, Rexam PLC shall apply for a
          refund of the VAT (plus any interest payable by Customs), use
          reasonable endeavours to obtain it as speedily as practicable, and pay
          to the Purchaser the amount of the refund and any interest when and to
          the extent received from Customs.

SECTION 8.6       COOPERATION.

         After the Closing Date, Purchaser and Rexam PLC shall make available to
the other, as reasonably requested, and to any taxing authority in the event
requested by the other, all information, records or documents relating to Tax
liabilities or potential Tax liabilities of the Subject Companies for all
periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date and shall preserve all
such information, records, and documents until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations or extensions thereof. Purchaser shall prepare and

packages shall be completed by Purchaser and provided to Rexam PLC within 60

reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses of providing information, rendering
assistance or preparing returns for taxable periods (or portions thereof) for
which the other is responsible.

SECTION 8.7       GENERAL PRINCIPLES.

         To the extent not specifically addressed herein, all taxes of the
Acquired Company for periods prior to the Closing shall be for the account of
Rexam PLC or its applicable Affiliates, and Rexam PLC or its applicable
Affiliates shall prepare and timely file the returns and pay the Taxes for such
periods. To the extent that income of the Acquired Company for periods through
the Closing Date is reportable on Tax Returns for periods after the Closing Date
required to be filed by Purchaser or the Acquired Company, the Taxes on such
income through the Closing Date shall be excluded in the calculation of the
Closing Date Net Asset Value.

SECTION 8.8       FIRPTA TAX CERTIFICATES.

If requested by Purchaser, (i) on or before the Closing Date the Acquired

the Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code, or (ii) on or
before the Closing Date the Company Shareholder will deliver to Purchaser a

Price any required withholding tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

                          SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 10.4      METHOD OF ASSERTING CLAIMS.

         All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under this
Article X shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

               (a) Third Party Claims. If any claim or demand in respect of
          which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under this Article X
          is asserted against such Indemnified Party by a Person (a "Third Party
          Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "Third
          Party Claim Notice") and the details thereof including an estimate of
          the claimed Losses, copies of all relevant pleadings, documents and
          information to the Indemnifying Party within a period of 30 days
          following the assertion of the Third Party Claim against the
          Indemnified Party (the "Third Party Claim Notice Period"). If the
          Indemnified Party fails to provide the Third Party Claim Notice within
          the Third Party Claim Notice Period, the Indemnifying Party will not
          be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such
          Third Party Claim to the extent that the Indemnifying Party's ability
          to defend has been prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified
          Party. Within 20 days after its receipt of the Third Party Claim
          Notice by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall, in
          writing, either acknowledge or deny its obligations to indemnify and
          defend under this Article X.

               If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligations to
          indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party
          Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall defend such Third Party Claim
          by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently
          prosecuted to a final conclusion or will be settled, at the discretion
          of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
          Party shall not enter into any settlement that does not fully and
          finally release the Indemnified Party from all claims, unless
          consented to by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party may only
          assume control of such defense if (i) it acknowledges in writing to
          the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines, costs or other
          liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party in
          connection with such suit or proceeding constitute Losses for which
          the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article X
          and (ii) the AD DAMNUM is less than or equal to the amount of Losses
          for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under this Article X and
          (iii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of
          a suit or proceeding involving criminal liability or in which
          equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party. If the
          Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of such defense, the
          Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The party not


                                       65


<PAGE>


          controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense;
          provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such
          defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the
          Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party have conflicting
          interests or different defenses available with respect to such suit or
          proceedings, the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the
          Indemnified Party shall be considered "Losses" for purposes of this
          Agreement. The Indemnified Party will cooperate fully in such defense,
          including without limitation by making available to the Indemnifying
          Party all books, records and documents within the Indemnified Party's
          control or that it can reasonably obtain relating to the Third Party
          Claim, and all costs or expenses incurred by it at the request of the
          Indemnifying Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The
          Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Party's cost and expense,
          at any time to prevent default or protect its interests file any
          pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnified Party
          reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its
          interests due to the failure of the Indemnified Party to diligently
          defend such action. The Indemnified Party, at its expense, may
          participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
          Third Party Claim conducted by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
          Section 10.4(a).

               (b) Other Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have
          a claim under this Article X against any Indemnifying Party that does
          not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
          give written notice (the "Indemnity Notice") and the details thereof,
          including an estimate of the claimed Losses, copies of all relevant
          information and documents to the Indemnifying Party within a period of
          30 days following the discovery of the claim by the Indemnified Party
          (the "Claim Notice Period"). The failure by any Indemnified Party to
          give the Indemnity Notice within the Claim Notice Period shall not
          impair the Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except to the extent
          that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced
          thereby. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party
          within a period of 20 days after the receipt of the Indemnity Notice
          by the Indemnifying Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
          liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article X with respect
          to such claim.

SECTION 10.5      MONETARY LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

         No amount of indemnity shall be payable by an Indemnifying Party in the
case of a claim by any Indemnified Party under Section 10.2(a) or Section
10.3(a) unless, until and only to the extent that such Indemnified Party has
suffered or incurred Losses consisting of actual damages aggregating in excess
of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000) (the "Deductible Amount") whereupon
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to claim indemnification for the amount
in excess of the Deductible Amount, provided that, except for claims relating to
Environmental Clean-Up Activities or for fraud, in no event shall the aggregate
indemnity amount payable by any Indemnifying Party under Section 10.2(a) and
10.2(b), in the case of Rexam PLC, and 10.3(a) and 10.3(b), in the case of the
Purchaser, exceed Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.5 shall be construed to limit the right of
either party to enforce the provisions of Section 5.9 hereof or provisions of
Sections 5.5(b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (k) and (l), 5.6(b), 5.9(c) and (d),
5.13(b), 7.2(b), (c) and (d) or


                                       66


<PAGE>


any other payment or indemnification covenant contained in this Agreement, in
each case in accordance with its respective terms.

SECTION 10.6      EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES.

         The sole and exclusive remedies for any party hereto with respect to
any claim relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
the facts and circumstances relating and pertaining hereto shall be governed by
this Agreement (whether any such claim shall be made in contract, breach of
warranty, tort or otherwise); provided, however, that, in the event of a breach
of the Agreement that does not result in termination of the Agreement by the
non-breaching party, the foregoing shall not limit the availability to any party
hereof of injunctive and other equitable relief, including specific performance.
The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for
which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party
agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the other party shall be entitled to
seek an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of the
provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any action should be brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, neither party will allege,
and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is adequate remedy at law.

SECTION 10.7      TIME LIMITS ON CLAIMS.

         No claim or action shall be brought under this Article X hereto for
breach of a representation or warranty more than one year following the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, or any other provision of this
Agreement:

         (i) There shall be no time limitation on claims or actions brought for
breach of any representation or warranty made in or pursuant to Section 3.5
(title to shares).

         (ii) Any claim pursuant to Section 3.18 (environmental) may be brought
at any time within three years after the Closing Date.

         (iii) Any claim or action brought for breach of any representation or
warranty made in or pursuant to Section 3.21 (taxes) may be brought at any time
until the underlying Tax obligation is barred by the applicable period of
limitation under applicable laws relating thereto.

         Any claim not made within the foregoing relevant time period shall
expire and be forever barred thereafter.

SECTION 10.8      TAX EFFECT AND INSURANCE.

         The liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss shall
be reduced by the Tax benefit actually realized and any insurance proceeds
received by the Indemnified Party as a result of any such Losses and shall
include any tax detriment actually suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result
of such Losses. The amount of any such Tax benefit or detriment shall be
determined by taking into account the effect, if any and to the extent
determinable, of


                                       67

timing differences resulting from the acceleration or deferral of items of gain
or loss resulting from such Losses and shall otherwise be determined so that
payment by the Indemnifying Party, as adjusted to give effect to any such Tax
benefit or detriment, will make the Indemnified Party as economically whole as
is reasonably practical with respect to the Losses upon which the Indemnified
Party's claim is based.

         after the Closing as if originally made between Purchaser and such
         Active Employees or between Purchaser and the relevant trade union (as
         the case may be) and that at the Closing such Active Employees shall
         become "Continuing U.K. Employees" for purposes of this Agreement.

2.2      The Asset Seller shall discharge all its obligations in respect of its
         Active Employees up to the Closing and Rexam PLC shall indemnify
         Purchaser against all liabilities arising from the Assets Seller's

2.3      Purchaser shall from and after the Closing discharge all the

         liabilities arising from Purchaser's failure to do so.

2.4      Rexam PLC shall indemnify Purchaser against any liability relating to a

         respect of an award of compensation under Regulation 11 thereof arising
         from such failure; provided that Rexam PLC shall not be obligated to
         defend Purchaser for any failure or award of compensation which results

         Employment Regulations and/or to provide the Selling Parties with
         information necessary for Rexam PLC to comply with such Employment
         Regulations) occurring before the Closing excluding any liability

<PAGE>


2.6      If the contract of employment of any Continuing U.K. Employee is found
         or alleged not to have effect after the Closing as if originally made
         with Purchaser as a consequence of the transactions under this
         Agreement other than by virtue of Regulation 5(4A) of the Employment
         Regulations, Purchaser agrees that:

         (a)      in consultation with the Asset Seller (which for the purpose
                  of this clause shall mean the Asset Seller or any of its
                  Affiliates where appropriate), it will, within 14 days of
                  being so requested by the Asset Seller (as long as the request
                  is made no later than 14 days after the Asset Seller becomes
                  aware of such finding or allegation), make to that Continuing
                  U.K. Employee an offer in writing to employ him under a new
                  contract of employment to take effect upon the termination
                  referred to below; and

         (b)      the offer to be made will be such that none of the terms and
                  conditions of the new contract (other than any terms and
                  conditions relating to the identity of the employer) will
                  differ from the corresponding provision of the Continuing U.K.
                  Employee's contract of employment immediately before the
                  Closing.

         Upon that offer being made (or at any time after the expiry of the 14
         days if the offer is not made as requested), the Asset Seller shall
         terminate the employment of the Continuing U.K. Employee by giving due
         notice and or making an appropriate payment in lieu of notice and
         complying with all relevant dismissal procedures required by law and
         taking all reasonable steps to mitigate any damages or compensation
         which might be awarded to the persons concerned and subject to the
         Asset Seller acting in that way Purchaser shall indemnify the Selling
         Parties against any liability which arises out of or in connection with
         the employment of that Continuing U.K. Employee after the Closing until
         such termination and against any liability which arises out of or in
         connection with such termination.

2.7      If the contract of employment of any person who is not a Continuing
         U.K. Employee is found or alleged to have effect after the Closing as
         if originally made with Purchaser as a consequence of the transactions
         under this Agreement, the Asset Seller or any its Affiliates where
         appropriate agrees that:

                  (a)      in consultation with Purchaser, it will, within 14
                           days of being so requested by Purchaser (as long as
                           the request is made no later than 14 days after
                           Purchaser becomes aware of such finding or
                           allegation) make to that person an offer in writing
                           to employ him under a new contract of employment to
                           take effect upon the termination referred to below;
                           and

                  (b)      the offer to be made will be such that none of the
                           terms and conditions of the new contract will differ
                           from the corresponding provision of that person's
                           contract of employment immediately before the
                           Closing.

         Upon that offer being made (or at any time after the expiry of the 14
         days if the offer is not made as requested), Purchaser shall terminate
         the employment of the person concerned by giving due notice and or
         making an appropriate payment in lieu of notice and complying with all
         relevant dismissal procedures required by law and taking all

         reasonable steps to mitigate any damages or compensation which might
         be awarded to the persons concerned and subject to Purchaser acting in
         that way the Asset Seller or any of its Affiliates where appropriate
         shall indemnify Purchaser against any liability which arises out of or
         in connection with the employment of such person after the Closing
         until such termination and against any liability which arises out of
         or in connection with such termination.

         SECTION 3. ASSET SELLER PENSION PLAN

3.1      If during the Transitional Period any of the Continuing U.K. Employees
         are transferred from the employment of Purchaser to an Affiliate of
         Purchaser (the "New Employer"), Rexam PLC shall, at the request of
         Purchaser, use all reasonable efforts to cause the New Employer to be
         duly admitted to participation in the Rexam Scheme with effect from the
         date of such transfer or if more than one such transfer occurs with
         effect from the date of the first such transfer. If for any reason the
         New Employer is not duly admitted to participation in the Rexam Scheme
         then in respect of the Continuing U.K. Employees transferred to it the
         day next following the date of such transfer shall be the Membership
         Transfer Date in relation to those Continuing U.K. Employees and this
         Schedule 5.5(g) shall take effect accordingly. Subject to the New
         Employer being so admitted, the New Employer and Purchaser shall be
         treated as one of the purposes of this Schedule 5.5(g).

3.2      (A) Purchaser will participate in the Rexam Scheme throughout the
         Transitional Period in respect of those Continuing U.K. Employees who
         are or are entitled to be Members subject to the treatment of the Rexam
         Scheme as an Exempt Approved Scheme not being prejudiced (which consent
         Rexam PLC shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain) and to Purchaser
         complying with the terms of this Schedule 5.5(g) and the Rules in all
         material respects.

                  (B) Purchaser and Rexam PLC shall use their respective
         reasonable efforts to procure that the Continuing U.K. Employees who
         are Members remain in contracted-out employment by reference to the
         Rexam Scheme through the Transitional Period.

                  (C) Purchaser undertakes that it will not, and will procure
         that none of Purchaser's Affiliates will, during or in respect of the
         Transitional Period:

                           (1) do or omit to do any act or thing whereby the
                  approval of the Rexam Scheme as an Exempt Approved Scheme or
                  the Rexam Scheme as a contracted-out scheme would or might be
                  prejudiced;

                           (2) exercise any power or discretion under the Rules
                  except on payment of such additional contribution as the
                  Actuary determines and on such other terms as the Rexam Scheme
                  may reasonably require;

                           (3) increase the pensionable earnings of any
                  Continuing UK Employees who are Members without the consent of
                  Rexam PLC.

                  (D) Purchaser shall procure the prompt payment to or to the
         order of the Rexam Scheme of the following in respect of the
         Transitional Period or the part thereof


<PAGE>


         in which Purchaser is participating in respect of those of the
         Continuing U.K. Employees who are Members from time to time:

                           (1) In respect of employer's contribution to the
                  Rexam Scheme from Closing Date: 19.9% of Gross Earnings;

                           (2) Members' contributions at the rate required under
                  the Rules; and

                           (3) the Members' AVCs.

                  Purchaser acknowledges that these contributions are paid
         monthly to the Trustees on or before the 19th of the month following
         the month of collection.

                  (E)      Rexam PLC undertakes that:

                           (1) it will not do or omit to do anything during or
                  in relation to the Transitional Period which would or might
                  prejudice the approval of the Rexam Scheme as an Exempt
                  Approved Scheme;

                           (2) it will indemnify and keep indemnified and hold
                  harmless on a continuing basis Purchaser against all and any
                  liability to make any contribution or payment to or in
                  connection with the Rexam Scheme with respect to the
                  Transitional Period other than to pay contributions pursuant
                  to Section 3.2(D) of this Schedule;

                           (3) it will maintain the Rexam Scheme in full force
                  and effect; and

                           (4) it will give at least one month's written notice
                  to Purchaser of the exercise of a power or discretion under
                  the Rexam Scheme in a way that would adversely affect in a
                  material way Purchaser and/or all or any of its Employees.

         The parties to this Agreement do not intend that any part of this
         Schedule 5.5(g) will be enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Right
         of Third Parties) Act 1999 by any person not a party to it.

3.3            (A) Not later than two months before the Membership Transfer Date
         Purchaser will provide to Rexam PLC particulars of one or more proposed
         pension schemes which Purchaser intends to be Purchaser's Scheme for
         the purposes of this Schedule 5.5(g). The scheme (or each such scheme)
         must be a scheme which satisfies the terms of this Section 3.3.

               (B) Purchaser will procure that Purchaser's Scheme:

                           (1) is established and wholly administered in this
                  United Kingdom;

                           (2) is Exempt Approved (or designed so as to be
                  capable of such approval) or approved under section 630, Taxes
                  Act 1988; and


<PAGE>


                           (3) is contracted-out within the meaning of the
                  Pension Schemes Act 1993 and a scheme to which the Rexam
                  Scheme is permitted by law to make a transfer payment in
                  respect of the entire rights under the Rexam Scheme of the
                  Members (including contracted-out rights).

                  (C) Without restricting the Purchaser's ability to amend the
         Purchaser's Scheme after the Membership Transfer Date, Purchaser will
         at the outset offer to each Continuing U.K. Employee who is a Member
         immediately before the Membership Transfer Date, membership in
         Purchaser's Scheme with benefits and on terms that are substantially no
         less favorable overall in value for the generality of the members than
         those which would have applied under the Rexam Scheme if he had
         continued in membership after the Membership Transfer Date (assuming
         that the Rexam Scheme is not altered after the Closing except as
         mentioned in any document referred to in this Schedule 5.5(g)).

3.4      Purchaser will not, and will procure that Purchaser's Affiliates and
         Purchaser's Scheme will not, take any action or provide any assistance
         to any person which might or would result in a claim or in the Rexam
         Scheme transferring a smaller or a larger amount than the cash
         equivalent to Purchaser's Scheme.

3.5               (A) In this Section 3.5, the "Statutory Provisions" means
         those provisions of the Pensions Act 1995 and the regulations which are
         listed below.

                  (B) Purchaser hereby irrevocably nominates Rexam PLC to act on
         its behalf in relation to the Statutory Provisions and the Rexam Scheme
         or, where the relevant provision of the Statutory Provision does not
         allow for such nomination, Purchaser waives any right it may have under
         the provision.

                  (C) Pursuant to Section 3.2 of this Schedule, Rexam PLC may do
         all such reasonable acts (including, without limitation, the giving of
         such consents and the execution of all such documents on behalf of, in
         the name of, Purchaser) as Rexam PLC may consider necessary in
         connection with the Statutory Provisions.

                  (D) The provisions of this Section 3.5 may be amended or
         revoked in whole or in part at any time by agreement in writing between
         Purchaser and Rexam PLC.

                  (E) Purchaser will observe and perform the provisions set out
         in this Section 3.5 as if they were included in the deed under which
         Purchaser participates in the Rexam Scheme provided it does not impose
         any financial obligations or liability on Purchaser.
