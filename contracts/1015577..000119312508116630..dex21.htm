Section _2.03(d)_ and (iii) this Agreement shall not have previously been
validly terminated in accordance with  _Section 10.01_, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twelve (12) business days
(as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall,
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
the Offer for all of the outstanding Company Common Shares (other than Company
Common Shares described in _Section 4.01(a)_) for a price per Company Common
Share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in _Section

of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this

(b) As promptly as practicable on the later of: (i) the earliest date as of
which Purchaser is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment

date as of which each of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer
Conditions_ ") shall have been satisfied or waived, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to), except as contemplated by _Section
2.01(d)(iv)_, accept for payment all Company Common Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn). The obligation of Purchaser to
accept for payment Company Common Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer Conditions
(and shall not be subject to any other conditions). Promptly after the
acceptance for payment of any Company Common Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer, Purchaser shall pay for such Company Common Shares.

(c) Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer
Price, waive any Offer Condition or amend, modify or supplement any of
the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall
(without the prior written consent of the Company):

(i) change or waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex I_ );

(ii) decrease the number of Company Common Shares sought to be purchased by
Purchaser in the Offer;

(iii) reduce the Offer Price;

(iv) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer (except to
the extent permitted or required pursuant to _Section 2.01(d)_);



 

11 (v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; or

(vi) amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the
Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect, the holders of Company Common Shares.

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on
the date (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") that is twenty (20) business days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act ) after the Offer Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq that
is applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser
be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date, (ii) if, on the
Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is
scheduled to expire (an " _Extended Expiration Date_ "), the Minimum Condition
or the Regulatory Condition is not satisfied, then, to the extent requested
in writing by the Company no less than two (2) business days prior to the
applicable expiration date, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for one or more
periods ending no later than the Outside Date, to permit either of such Offer
Conditions to be satisfied; _provided_ , that no individual extension shall be
for a period of more than ten (10) business days and, _provided_ _further_
that Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer under this clause
(ii) to a date beyond the date which is twenty (20) business days after the
date on which the Regulatory Condition is satisfied, (iii) if, on the Initial
Expiration Date or any Extended Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied and this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its
terms, Purchaser may, in its discretion, extend the Offer for one or more
periods, (iv) if the Company shall have requested in writing no less than two
(2) business days prior to the Initial Expiration Date, Purchaser shall extend
the Offer for the period of time stated in the Companys written request
(which period shall not exceed ten (10) business days beyond the Initial
Expiration Date) notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
Offer Conditions on or prior to the Initial Expiration Date and (v) Purchaser
may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a subsequent offering period
(and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act following the Acceptance Time, and, if
immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Purchaser and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates own more than 80% but less than
90% of the Company Common Shares outstanding at that time (which shares
beneficially owned shall include shares tendered in the Offer and not
withdrawn), to the extent reasonably requested by the Company, Purchaser
shall provide for a subsequent offering period of at least ten (10) business
days. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Offer, Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall, accept for
payment and pay for all Company Common Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn during such subsequent offering period as promptly as practicable
after any such Company Common Shares are tendered during such subsequent
offering period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

(e) The Offer may be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such
expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement), but only if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with _Section 10.01_.



 

12 (f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect the
effect of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Company Common
Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the payment by Purchaser for the Company Common Shares;
_provided_ that this subsection (f) shall not affect or supersede the
provisions of _Section 5.01(b)_ hereof.

Section 2.02 _Actions of Parent and Purchaser_.

(a) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall: (i) cause to
be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer, which will contain Purchasers offer to purchase and related

being referred to collectively in this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_ ")
and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company
Common Shares as required by applicable Law.

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to (i) comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by Parent
or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.

review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any amendment
or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and

its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and (ii) give the Company and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any response

Shares.

to purchase any Company Common Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to

13 Section 2.03 _Actions by the Company_.

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents
that the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), at a
meeting duly called and held, unanimously duly adopted resolutions (i)
approving and declaring the advisability of this Agreement, (ii) approving
this Agreement and the Transactions (such approval having been made
in accordance with the DGCL, including for purposes of Section 203 thereof),
(iii) determining this Agreement and the Transactions to be advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company
(the " _Company Stockholders_ ") and (iv) recommending that, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Company Stockholders accept
the Offer, tender their Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer and adopt
this Agreement and the Transactions, if required (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation as provided by 
_Section 8.03_. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the Company Board Recommendation to the extent such Company Board
Recommendation is not withheld or withdrawn in accordance with  _Section
8.03_. To the extent the foregoing recommendation has been amended or modified
in accordance with _Section 8.03_, the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of such recommendation, as so amended or modified, in the Offer
Documents. The Company also represents and warrants that (A) the Company Board
has received the opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated (the " _Company
Financial Advisor_ "), dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that,
as of such date, and subject to the various assumptions and qualifications set
forth therein, the consideration to be received by the Company Stockholders in
the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point
of view and (B) the Company has obtained or will timely obtain all necessary
consents (including the authorization of the Company Financial Advisor) to
permit the inclusion of such opinion in its entirety and references thereto in
the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the proxy statement or
information statement relating to the Merger (as amended, supplemented or
modified, the " _Proxy/Information Statement_ "), subject to prior review and
consent by the Company Financial Advisor (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). The Company has been advised by each of its directors
and executive officers that each such person intends to tender all Company
Common Shares owned by such person pursuant to the Offer and that the Offer
Documents may so state.

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the SEC
and (contemporaneously with the initial dissemination of the Offer Documents
to holders of Company Common Shares to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws) disseminate to holders of Company Common Shares a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to
_Section 8.03_, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation. Except in
connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with
_Section 8.03_, Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
The Company shall: (x) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide Parent
and its  



 

14  counsel with a copy of any written comments and a description of any oral
comments received by the Company (or its counsel) from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, (y) except with respect to any disclosure
made relating to an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section
8.03_, give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any response formulated in connection with such comments prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC and (z) respond promptly to any such comments.
The Company agrees that the Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and, on the date filed
with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company
Stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ , that no covenant is made by the
Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or
Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9.
To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act: (A)
each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and
(B) the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as
supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC
and, if required, to be disseminated to holders of Company Common Shares.
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent or Purchaser that may be reasonably requested in connection
with any action contemplated by this _Section 2.03(b)_. To the extent
requested by the Company, Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed
or otherwise disseminated to the Company Stockholders together with the Offer
Documents disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish to Purchaser a list, as of the most recent practicable date,
of the record holders of Company Common Shares and their addresses, as well as
mailing labels containing such names and addresses. The Company will furnish
Purchaser with such additional information (including any security position
listings in the Companys possession or reasonably obtainable by the Company)
and assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request for purposes
of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial holders of
Company Common Shares. All information furnished in accordance with this
_Section 2.03(c)_ shall be held in confidence by Parent and Purchaser in
accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall
be used by Parent and Purchaser only in connection with the communication of
the Offer and the dissemination of any Proxy/Information Statement relating to
the Merger to the holders of Company Common Shares.

(d) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish to Parent
and Purchaser all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser for
inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents.

Section 2.04 _Board of Directors_.

(a) After the first time that Purchaser accepts for payment any Company
Common Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and
at all times  



 

15  thereafter, the Company will, upon Parents request and subject to
compliance with applicable Law, take all actions reasonably necessary to
cause persons designated by Parent to become directors of the Company so that
the total number of such persons equals that number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, determined by multiplying: (i) the total number of
directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected
or designated by Parent in accordance with this _Section 2.04(a)_) by (ii)
the percentage that the number of Company Common Shares beneficially owned by
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates bears to the total
number of Company Common Shares outstanding at the Acceptance Time (determined
on a fully-diluted basis but disregarding any unvested stock option and other
unvested rights to acquire Company Common Shares). The Company will take all
actions reasonably necessary to permit Parents designees to be elected to the
Company Board in accordance with this _Section 2.04(a)_ , including using
commercially reasonable efforts to secure the resignation of directors,
promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board, increasing the size of the Company Board, and/or amending the Company
Bylaws; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
Company Board shall always have at least three (3) Continuing Directors.
Notwithstanding the proviso to the preceding sentence, at all times from the
election of Parents designees in accordance with this  _Section 2.04(a)_
through the Merger Effective Time, Parents designees shall constitute a
majority of the Company Board. The Company shall, upon Parents request
following the Acceptance Time, and at all times thereafter, also cause
persons designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to
the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in
each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of Nasdaq.
For purposes of this _Section 2.04(a)_, any and all members of the Company
Board immediately prior to the Acceptance Time who remain on the Company Board
after such designation by Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)_ shall be
referred to as " _Continuing Directors_ ".

(b) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ hereof, until the Merger
Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least such number of directors
as may be required by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules or the federal securities
laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such rules
and laws (" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in such
event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the
number of directors as may be required by such rules or securities laws for
any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be
entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such
number of directors as may be required by the rules of Nasdaq and the federal
securities laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders or
Affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection (b), at all times from the election of Parents
designees in accordance with _Section 2.04(a)_ through the Merger Effective
Time, Parents designees shall constitute a majority of the Company Board.

(c) The Companys obligation to cause Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule  



 

16  14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder require in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 2.04_, so long as Parent shall have timely provided to the Company
all information with respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors
and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. Parent shall promptly supply to the Company in writing, and shall
be solely responsible for, all such information.

Section 2.05 _Actions by Directors_. Following the election or appointment of
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_, and
until the Merger Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall be required to authorize: (a) any amendment to or termination
of this Agreement by the Company; (b) any amendment to the Company Charter or
Company Bylaws; (c) any extension of time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser; (d) any enforcement or
waiver of compliance with any covenant of Parent or Purchaser or any
condition to any obligation of the Company or any exercise, enforcement or
waiver of any right of the Company under this Agreement; and (e) any other
consent or action by the Company or the Company Board with respect to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions. The authorization of any such matter by
a majority of the Continuing Directors shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, constitute the authorization of such matter by the
Company Board, and no other action on the part of the Company or any other
director of the Company shall be required to authorize such matter.

Section 2.06 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an option, for so long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01_ (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), to purchase from the Company up to a number of newly-issued
Company Common Shares (such number of Company Common Shares, the " _Top-
Up Amount_ ") that, when added to the number of Company Common Shares owned
by Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one (1)
Company Common Share more than 90% of the number of Company Common Shares that
would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Company Common
Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option; _provided_ that the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable unless (i) immediately prior to such exercise,
Purchaser owns a majority of the Company Common Shares then outstanding on a
fully diluted basis as a result of the consummation of the Offer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) immediately after such exercise
Purchaser would own more than ninety percent (90%) of the Company Common
Shares then outstanding.

(b) Subject to there being no statute, rule or regulation having been enacted
or promulgated by any Governmental Authority which prohibits the consummation
of the Merger and no order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction
in effect preventing consummation of the Top-Up Option or the Merger,
Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole
but not in part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise
Event and prior to the Merger Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement,
a " _Top-Up Exercise Event_ " shall occur if (i) the Acceptance Date shall
have occurred and (ii) the Company has a number of authorized but unissued
Company Common Shares at least equal to  



 

17  the Top-Up Amount. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Company
Common Shares being purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall
be payable, at the option of Parent, either in cash or by delivery of a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to such aggregate purchase
price. The aggregate amount payable to the Company in respect of the Company
Common Shares being purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option
shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Company Common Shares by
the Offer Price.

(c) In the event that Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number
of Company Common Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant to the
Top-Up Option, (ii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of
such Company Common Shares by Purchaser is to take place and (iii) the form of
payment for the purchase of such Company Common Shares, as elected by
Purchaser in accordance with _Section 2.06(b)_. At the closing of the
purchase of such Company Common Shares, Purchaser shall cause to be delivered
to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for
such Company Common Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to
Purchaser a certificate representing such Company Common Shares. The closing
of the purchase of the Company Common Shares issuable pursuant to Purchasers
exercise of the Top-Up Option shall occur within three (3) Business Days
following the notice delivered by Purchaser in accordance with this _Section
2.06(c)_.

and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of

Section 3.04 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 10.01_, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the
third (3rd) Business Day) after all of the conditions set forth in _Article
IX_ (other than conditions which by their terms are required to be satisfied
or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the

Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries, as specified by Parent, to tender
their resignations as directors, effective as of the Merger Effective Time
and to deliver to Parent written evidence of such resignations at the Merger
Effective Time.

ARTICLE IV

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

Section 4.01  _Effects of the Merger on Company Securities_. At the Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company (other than any
requisite adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the DGCL):

(a) Each Company Common Share held in treasury and each Company Common Share
that is owned by Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.



 

19 (b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time (other than Company Dissenting Shares, Company Common
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 4.01(a)_ and the Company
Common Shares held by N Holdings I, Inc., a subsidiary of Parent), shall be
converted and exchanged automatically into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the
holder thereof in accordance with _Section 4.03_. At the Merger Effective
Time, all such Company Common Shares which have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any
such Company Common Share immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company Common Shares
that are to be so converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_ ".

(c) The Company shall take all requisite action such that (i) in the case of
each Company Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) having an exercise
price per share that is less than the Merger Consideration, each such Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled, as of the Merger Effective Time, in exchange
for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 4.05_
with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (x) the excess of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option by (y) the number of Company Common Shares subject to
such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "); and (ii) in the
case of each Company Stock Option having an exercise price per share equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, each such Company Stock Option shall
be assumed by Parent as of the Merger Effective Time and, accordingly, will
cease to represent a right to acquire Company Common Shares and shall be
converted as of the Merger Effective Time into an option (a " _Converted
Option_ ") to purchase shares of common stock of Parent (" _Parent Common
Shares_ "). The number of Parent Common Shares subject to each Converted
Option shall be equal to the product of the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by the Option Ratio (as
defined below); _provided_ , that any fractional shares of Company Common
Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole share. The exercise price per share of each Converted Option shall equal
the quotient of the exercise price per share under the corresponding Company
Stock Option divided by the Option Ratio; _provided_ , that such exercise
price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each such Converted
Option will otherwise have substantially the same terms and conditions
(including vesting terms) as the corresponding Company Stock Option.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of
options under this  _Section 4.01(c)_ shall be made in a manner that will
comply with Section 409A of the Code, and, if applicable, Section 424(a) of
the Code. For purposes hereof, " _Option Ratio_ " shall mean the price of the
last trade of the Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Closing
divided by the price of the first trade of the Parent Common Shares
immediately following the Closing. Following the Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of the
Converted Options in accordance with this _Section 4.01(c)_. As soon as
practicable following the  



 

20  Merger Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with
respect to the Parent Common Shares subject to the Converted Options and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement on Form S-8 (and maintain current the status of
the prospectus contained therein) for so long as the Converted Options remain
outstanding. Payment of the Option Consideration shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Merger Effective Time but in any event within three (3)
Business Days following the Merger Effective Time.

Section 4.02 _Effects of the Merger on Purchaser Securities_. At the Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Purchaser
or Parent, as the holder of all outstanding capital stock of Purchaser (other
than the requisite approval by Parent as the sole stockholder of Purchaser in
accordance with the DGCL, which approval will be effected immediately
following execution of this Agreement), each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.03 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Stock Transfer Books_.

(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall appoint as paying
agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "
_Company Paying Agent_ "). Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Company Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and Company Stock
Options, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid plus cash in an amount sufficient to pay
holders of Company Stock Options in accordance with this Agreement (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation Fund_ "). The
Surviving Corporation Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) The Surviving Corporation Fund shall be invested by the Company Paying
Agent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest, (iii)
commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either
Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The
McGraw Hill Companies, or (iv) such other investments, or a combination of the
foregoing, as directed by and for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
the holders of Merger Shares or Company Stock Options following completion of
the Merger pursuant to this _Article IV_ and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Surviving Corporation Fund includes at all times
cash sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this _Article IV_. Any
and all interest and other income earned on the Surviving Corporation Fund
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days following the Merger Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company Paying Agent to
mail to each person who was, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time, a holder of record of the Merger Shares (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form approved by the Company and shall  



 

21  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates representing the Merger Shares (the " _Company Common
Share Certificates_ ") or uncertificated Merger Shares represented by book
entry (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Company Common Share Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Company Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Company Common Share Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(d) Upon (i) surrender to the Company Paying Agent of Company Common Share
Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions or
(ii) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Company
Paying Agent for delivery of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such
Company Common Share Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger Consideration
in respect thereof, and the Company Common Share Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Company Common Share
Certificates so surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is
registered if such Company Common Share Certificates shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated
Shares shall be properly transferred and the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as
contemplated by this _Section 4.03_, each Company Common Share Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Company Common Share Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_.

(f) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains undistributed
to the holders of Merger Shares for six (6) months after the Merger Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
holders of Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with this 
_Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
None of Parent, the Company Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Merger Shares for any such shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



 

22 (g) If any Company Common Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Common Share Certificate, the Company Paying Agent shall pay in
respect of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Common Share Certificate relate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled.

(h) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Share Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by applicable Law.

Section 4.04 _Company Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held by any Person
who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such Company
Common Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262
of the DGCL (such Section, " _Section 262_ " and, such Company Common Shares,
" _Company Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 4.01(b)_, but
rather, the holders of Company Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to
payment of the fair value of such Company Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Section 262 (and, at the Merger Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , that if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value
of such holders Company Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Company
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Merger
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in
_Section 4.01(b)_. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Company Common Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Merger
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration made available to the Company Paying
Agent pursuant to _Section 4.03(a)_ to pay for Company Dissenting Shares
shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

Section 4.05  _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Shares or Company Stock Options such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with  



 

23  respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority, including
any taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares and
Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as
applicable.

Section 4.06 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that,
notwithstanding _Section 7.01(b)_, the Company changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of Company Common Shares issued
and outstanding prior to the Merger Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Company Common Shares, at any time during the period from the
date hereof to the Merger Effective Time then the Merger Consideration and
Option Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction.

any Company Subsidiary, any of their  



 

28  properties or other assets or any of their businesses or operations, other
than, in the case of any written notice from a U.S. Governmental Authority,
where the claimed or alleged noncompliance was immaterial. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this _Section 5.06(b)_, no representation or warranty

except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring adjustments).

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or
effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary

statements or any Company SEC Reports.



 

29 (d) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on
Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Company SEC
Reports filed since January 1, 2005, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive
officer and each former principal financial officer of the Company) have made
all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete
and correct in all material respects.

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated
by the SEC under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors
and the Audit Committee of the Company Board (x) all significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls. The management of the
Company has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act at December 31, 2007, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective as of that date. To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
prevent its chief executive officer and chief financial officer from giving
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary nor any director, officer, agent, employee or Affiliate of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is aware of any action, or any
allegation of any action, or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, (i)
that would constitute a violation in any material respect by such Persons of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder the (" _FCPA_ "), including making use of the mails or
any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance
of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any
money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the
giving of anything of value to any "foreign official" (as such term is defined
in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any
candidate for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA, or (ii)
that would constitute an offer to pay, a promise to pay or a payment of money
or anything else of value, or an authorization of such offer, promise or
payment, directly or indirectly, to any employee, agent or representative of
another company or entity in the course of their business dealings with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, in order to induce such person to act
against the interest of his or her employer or principal.

(g) The Company has disclosed to Parent all internal investigations and, to
the knowledge of the Company, all external, governmental or other regulatory
investigations, in each case, regarding any action or any allegation of any
action described in subsection (f) of this _Section 5.07_.

(a) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their business in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (b) there has not been an event, occurrence, condition, change,
occurrence, development, effect or circumstance which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 5.09 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries do not have any material liabilities required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or in the footnotes
thereto, except for liabilities (a) reflected on or reserved against in the
Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 included in the
Company SEC Reports, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2007, (c) incurred pursuant
to and in compliance with Section 7.01, and (d) set forth on _Section 5.09_

the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no material Action pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective properties or
assets. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to
any material order, judgment, writ, injunction or decree or regulatory
restriction of any Governmental Authority.

Section 5.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the
date of this Agreement, all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
")) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive,
deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental
retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and
all material employment, change in control, termination, severance or other
contracts or agreements (other than individual employment and option
agreements) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, with
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or
which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than
any such benefit plans, programs, arrangements, contracts or agreements
maintained outside of the United States for the benefit of current or former
employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Plans_ "). The Company has made available to
Parent copies, which are correct and complete in all material respects, of the
following: (i) the Plans (including all amendments thereto), (ii) the annual
report (Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") for
the last two years, including attached schedules, (iii) the most recently
received IRS determination letter, if any, relating to the Plans; (iv) the
most recent summary plan description for such Plans (or other descriptions of
such Plans provided to employees) and all material modifications thereto; and
(v) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument for the Plans.



 

31 (b) Each Plan has been operated and administered in all respects in accordance
with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including ERISA
and the Code, except for such noncompliance that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or
Section 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS, or is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and
to the knowledge of the Company no fact or event has occurred since the date
of such determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There are no investigations by any Governmental
Authority, termination proceedings or other claims or litigation (except
routine claims for benefits payable under the Plans) against or involving any
Plan or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any Plan other
than any such investigations, proceedings or claims that have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. All contributions, premiums and benefit payments
under or in connection with the Plans that are required to have been made as
the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Plans have been timely
made. The Company has not engaged in a transaction with respect to any Plan
that, assuming a taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, is reasonably likely to subject the Company to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an
amount which would be material. The Company has not incurred nor does it
reasonably expect to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F
of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.11(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary sponsors or
has sponsored any Plan that provides for any post-employment or post-
retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or
current employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as required
by Section 4980B of the Code.

(d) To the extent that any Plans are subject to the requirements of Section
409A of the Code, they have been and are being operated in good faith
compliance with such Section, the regulations thereunder, and IRS Notice
2005-1, each as modified and explained by other guidance issued by the
Internal Revenue Service and, to the extent that any such Plans will apply to
any period after the earlier to occur of the Merger Effective Time or
December 31, 2008, they will, on or before the earlier to occur of such dates,
be formally amended to comply with the requirements of such Section and the
final Treasury regulations thereunder.

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 5.11(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Plan or other arrangement, either individually or collectively,
exists that, as a result of the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, whether alone or in connection with any
subsequent event(s), could result in the acceleration of provision of any
payment or benefit, or the vesting or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
result in any other material obligation pursuant to any of the Plans or
other arrangement, or otherwise result in payments under any of the Plans or
other arrangements which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code.



 

32 (f) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Plan which would
reasonably be expected to increase materially the expense of maintaining such
plan above the level of the expense incurred therefore for the most recent
fiscal year.

(g) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors or is obligated to
contribute (on a contingent basis or otherwise) to any Plan (or United
States based pension plan in the case of an ERISA Affiliate) that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code. For purposes of this
_Section 5.11(g)_, an entity is an " _ERISA Affiliate_ " of the Company if
it is considered a single employer with the Company under 4001(b) of ERISA or
part of the same controlled group as the Company for purposes of Section
302(d)(8)(C) of ERISA. The Company does not, currently or within the past
six (6) years, maintain, contribute or have an obligation to contribute (on a
contingent basis or otherwise) to a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA or a "multiple employer welfare plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

(h) Other than works council mandated by the laws of foreign jurisdictions,
the Company is not a party to any labor or collective bargaining agreement
and no such agreement is currently being negotiated. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have taken all actions as may be required in connection
with any foreign labor notification requirements, if any. There are no (i)
strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or lockouts pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving the Company; (ii)
unfair labor practice charges, material grievances or material complaints
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or on behalf of any
employee or group of employees of the Company; (iii) election, petition or
proceeding by a labor union or representative thereof to organize
any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (iv) material grievance
or arbitration demand against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether
or not filed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (i) with respect to their employment
status with the Company, all individuals providing services to the Company
have been properly classified, (ii) no person classified as an "independent
contractor" or "consultant" of or with the Company has been improperly
classified as such, rather than as an "employee" of the Company, and (iii) the
Company is in compliance with all Laws respecting the employment of labor,
including, but not limited to, wages and hours, fair employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment, workers compensation, occupational
safety, plant closings, mass layoffs and the Immigration Reform and Control
Act, as amended.

(j) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have properly accrued on their
books and records all material unpaid but accrued wages, salaries,
vacation and other paid time-off. As of the Merger Effective Time, the
Company will not have any outstanding loans or extensions of credit to any
employees (or their family members or dependents), excluding, for this
purpose, any loans outstanding to employees (or their beneficiaries) under
the Companys 401(k) plan or advances for business travel.



 

33 (k) With respect to benefit plans, programs, arrangements, contracts or
agreements maintained outside of the United States for the benefit of current
or former employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary other than plans, programs, arrangements, contracts or
agreements providing benefits mandated by the laws of the applicable foreign
jurisdiction (a " _Foreign Plan_ "), other than would not reasonably be

accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices;

(ii) each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable authorities;

(iii) other than routine claims for benefits, no Foreign Plan, no
administrator of any Foreign Plan, and no member of any body which administers

claim (including claims for income taxes, interest, penalties, fines or
excise taxes) or any other proceeding initiated by any Person, and there
exists no state of facts which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such action, investigation, examination, claim or proceeding; and

subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, no provision of any Foreign
Plan or of any agreement, and no act or omission of the Company in any way
limits, impairs, modifies, or otherwise affects the right of the Company to
unilaterally amend or terminate any Foreign Plan, and no commitments to
improve or otherwise amend any Foreign Plan have been made.

order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL,
the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, promptly and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold as soon as reasonably practicable following the date upon
which the Proxy/Information Statement is cleared by the SEC, a meeting of the
Company Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"), or, if
applicable, make arrangements for the Company Stockholders to act by written
consent as soon as reasonably practicable, in each case, for the sole purpose
of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval and shall include in the
Proxy/Information Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

(e) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall vote (including, if applicable, by way
of action by written consent) all Company Common Shares acquired in the Offer
(or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries
as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
in accordance with the DGCL at the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise.
Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Purchaser beneficially
owned by it in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the
DGCL.



 

47 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
and without, in any way, limiting or reducing Parents and Purchasers
obligation to cause the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser may request that the Company Board make arrangements to
cause the action required to be taken at the Company Stockholders Meeting
under this _Section 8.01_ for the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders to be taken by written consent without a meeting, and the Company
Board shall make such arrangements, if and to the extent such action by
written consent (A) is permitted under DGCL, the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws, in each case, then in effect and (B) would not impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders or the consummation of the Merger and (ii) in the event that
Purchaser shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued and
outstanding Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
such acquisition, without a meeting of the Company Stockholders, in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Section 8.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Law, from the date
hereof until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 10.01_ and the Merger Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford Parent, following notice from Parent to the Company
in accordance with this _Section 8.02_, reasonable access during normal
business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants
and other facilities, books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and all other financial, operating and other data and
information as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose
any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information.
Parent shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and
shall give the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
thereof, setting forth the inspection or materials that Parent or its
Representatives intend to conduct or review, as applicable. The Company shall
be entitled to have Representatives present at all times during any such
inspection. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ or information
provided, made available or delivered to Parent or its Representatives
pursuant to this  _Section 8.02_ shall affect any representations,
warranties, conditions or rights of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Closing, each of the Buyer Parties shall not, and shall cause
their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise
communicate with the employees (other than senior executives) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries regarding the business of the Company, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.



 

48 (c) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, all information obtained by Parent
pursuant to this  _Section 8.02 _shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the confidentiality agreement, dated May 7, 2008, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 8.03 _Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and terminate any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to a Company Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or
cause the destruction of all copies of confidential information previously
provided to such parties by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until the Acceptance Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of the Company Subsidiaries
to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Representative to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) the submission of, any Inquiry
(as defined below) or Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) approve or recommend
any Company Acquisition Proposal, enter into any agreement, agreement-in-
principle or letter of intent with respect to or accept any Company
Acquisition Proposal (or resolve to or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing), or (iii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , in response to an
unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry relating to a potential
Company Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement
(an " _Inquiry_ "), in each case, under circumstances not involving a breach
of this Agreement, the Company may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time,
(x) furnish confidential information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Inquiry or Company Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives, but only pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement shall
contain additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with
the provisions of this _Section 8.03_) _provided_ that (1) such
confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company advises
Parent of all such non-public information delivered to such Person
concurrently with its delivery to such Person (or promptly thereafter) and
concurrently with its delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent
all such information not previously provided to Parent, and (y) conduct
discussions and negotiate with such Person regarding such Inquiry or Company
Acquisition Proposal, it being understood that such discussions and
negotiations shall not be deemed to be a breach of  _Section 8.03(a)(i)_.
The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions
of this _Section 8.03(a)_.

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 8.03_ , the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in no event later than forty-
eight (48) hours after the event, (i) of the execution by the Company and a
person who has made an Inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal of any  



 

49  confidentiality agreement, (ii) of the commencement of substantive
discussions or negotiations concerning the Company or the terms of a possible
Company Acquisition Proposal between the Company and a person who has made an
Inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) of the making of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the
identity of any person referenced in clauses (i) through (iii) above and the
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and the nature of the
discussions or negotiations referenced in clause (ii) above (and shall include
with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf
of such Person relating to such proposal), and thereafter shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable keep Parent fully informed of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals (and the Company shall
provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received that
relate to such proposals) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.03(c)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of advisability by
the Company Board of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Offer
and the Merger) or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clause
(i) or (ii) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change __"_ ).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board may, in response to a Company Superior Proposal, withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend a Company Superior
Proposal, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after reviewing
applicable provisions of state law and after consulting with its outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the
failure to make such withdrawal, modification or recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under Delaware law.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 8.03_ shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act if such Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position
is likely to constitute a violation of applicable Law. In addition, nothing
in this _Section 8.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company from taking any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
the Company to take. 

Section 8.04 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Merger Effective Time (or such
shorter period as provided in any applicable agreement), Parent shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") to the extent they remain
employed during such period (i) compensation (including base salary or wages
and incentive compensation opportunities), that, in the aggregate, is no less
favorable than the compensation (including base salary or wages and incentive
compensation opportunities) provided to Company Employees immediately before
the Merger Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided to Company Employees
immediately before the Merger Effective Time; provided, however, this  



 

50  obligation to provide comparable compensation opportunities and benefits
shall not include any obligation to provide compensation and benefits similar
to those provided under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, defined benefit
pension, deferred compensation and retiree welfare benefit plans.

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual or
retiree welfare benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Merger
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Merger Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Merger Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit
plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to the Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation
of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) (A)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived, to the extent permitted under the New Plans, for such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under Old Plan of the Company or Company
Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time and (B) Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan, to the extent permitted under each New Plan, for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

(c) (i) With respect to annual bonus arrangements for Company Employees who
are covered by the 2008 Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Employees (the "
_Executive Plan_ ") for fiscal year 2008, the Company shall pay each eligible
Company Employee 25% of his or her target annual bonus (determined as if all
performance targets have been met) (the " _Pro-Rata Payments_ ") as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, Parent
agrees to continue the Executive Plan in accordance with its terms for
the remainder of fiscal year 2008 and based on the budgeted financial targets
previously established by the Compensation Committee of the Company for fiscal
year 2008; provided, that, any amounts due under the Executive Plan for fiscal
year 2008 shall be offset by the Pro-Rata Payments.

(ii) With respect to annual bonus arrangement for Company Employees who are
covered by the 2008 Annual Incentive Plan for Non-Executive Employees (the "
_Non-Executive Plan_ ") for fiscal year 2008, the Company shall pay each
eligible Company Employee  



 

51  the Pro-Rata Payments as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.
Following the Closing Date, Parent agrees to continue the Non-Executive Plan
in accordance with its terms for the remainder of fiscal year 2008 and based
on the budgeted financial targets previously established by the Incentive
Committee of the Company for the remainder of fiscal year 2008 provided, that,
any amounts due under the Non-Executive Plan for fiscal year 2008 shall be
offset by the Pro-Rata Payments.

(iii) All annual bonus arrangements for Company Employees for fiscal year
2007 that have not been paid prior to the date hereof will be paid in
accordance with their terms. The bonus plans for fiscal years 2007 and 2008
(including the Pro-Rata Payments) shall be calculated without taking
into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of
the Transactions (including any expenses or costs related to actions
undertaken in anticipation of the Transactions) or any non-recurring charges
that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the
Transactions not been anticipated or occurred.

(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that it is their intention
to develop mutually acceptable retention arrangements designed to ensure the
continued services of key employees of the Company.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) no
purchase period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement; (iii)
each participants outstanding right to purchase Company Common Shares under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be suspended immediately following the
end of the purchase period in effect on the date of this Agreement or
if earlier, each participants outstanding right to purchase Company Common
Shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate on the day
immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs; provided
that, in either case, all amounts allocated to each participants account
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of such date shall thereupon be used
to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Common Shares at the
applicable price for the then outstanding purchase period; and (iv) the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Plan, (ii) give any third party any
right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 8.04_ or (iii)
require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Plan
or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

Section 8.05 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the
Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares or Company Stock Options (or
Company Common Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company Stock Options)
pursuant to this Agreement shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16\.



 

52 Section 8.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance of the
Surviving Corporation_.

(a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Merger Effective
Time an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an
" _Indemnified Party_ __") as provided in the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant
to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof, including provisions
relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action
or suit or as permitted under applicable Law, shall survive the Merger and
shall remain in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Merger Effective Time and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such rights.

(b) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
the Company immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time who are then
covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy currently
maintained by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has been
delivered to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_"), to be covered for a period of
not less than six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, but only to the
extent related to actions or omissions of such officers and directors prior to
the Merger Effective Time in their capacities as such; _provided_ that (i)
Parent may, or may cause the Surviving Corporation to substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms no less
advantageous in any material respect to such former directors or officers and
(ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_
") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six (6) year period
as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum Amount. Parent
shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance
by obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the
provisions of this _Section 8.06(b)_. The Indemnified Parties may be required
to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary
representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance.

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 8.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 8.06_ applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 8.06_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section 8.06_, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this _Section 8.06_).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the  



 

53  continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the surviving corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.06_. 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this  _Section 8.06_ and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
_Section 8.06._

Section 8.07 _Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided, as promptly as practicable, the
Company, Parent and Purchaser shall (a) make all appropriate filings and
submissions under the HSR Act, with the NASD and with any other Governmental
Authority pursuant to applicable foreign antitrust, competition or
merger control Laws or otherwise, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as promptly as practicable the termination of any waiting period under
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust, competition or merger
control Laws, (c) cooperate and consult with each other in (i) determining
which filings are required to be made prior to the Acceptance Time and the
Merger Effective Time with, and which material consents, approvals, permits,
notices or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Acceptance
Time and the Merger Effective Time from, Governmental Authorities in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and related
agreements and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and (ii) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations, and (d) use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary or appropriate
to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company, on one hand, will provide Parent, and Parent, on the
other hand, will provide the Company, with copies of material correspondence,
filings or communications (or oral summaries or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such party or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of their respective
staffs, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. Without limiting any of the Companys obligations contained in
this _Section 8.07_, Parent and Purchaser shall coordinate, and assume
primary responsibility for managing, any required continuance of membership or
other application, notice filing or other required submission with the NASD or
any other self-regulatory agency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to (and none of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written
consent of Parent), in connection with the matters covered by this  _Section
8.07_, (i) pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees and expenses
and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to any contract, agreement or
other arrangement any material accommodation, (ii) commence or defend any
litigation, (iii) hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest
any of its businesses, product lines or assets or (iv) agree to any limitation
on the operation or conduct of its businesses, unless the
adverse consequences of the applicable actions described in clauses (i)
through (iv), whether to be suffered by Parent, Purchaser or the Company,
would be immaterial in relation to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 



 

54 Section 8.08 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price,"
"business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other
similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) the Company Board shall
take all actions necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.09 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by a party
without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press
release announcing the Transactions and the execution of this Agreement.

Section 8.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Purchaser and Parent and Purchaser shall give notice to
the Company, in each case, as promptly as reasonable practicable, of (i) any
written notice or other communication received from any person alleging that
the consent of such person is required in connection with the
Transactions, (ii) any notice from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions, or (iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this  _Section 8.10_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice and (y) the
failure to comply with the notice requirement of this _Section 8.10_ shall
not constitute a failure of the condition to the Offer set forth in paragraph
(b) of Annex I to be satisfied unless the underlying event itself would
independently result in the failure of such condition to be satisfied.

ARTICLE IX

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

Section 9.03 _Frustration of Conditions_. None of the Company or the Buyer
Parties may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 9.01_

Transactions, as required by and subject to _Section 8.07_. 

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

the termination or withdrawal of the Offer;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have
taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-
appealable and has the effect of making the acceptance for payment of Company
Common Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger illegal
or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger
(" _Governmental Order_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the terms of this
_Section 10.01(c)_ shall not be available to any party unless such party
shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such
Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or made

56 (d) by Parent if prior to the Acceptance Time there shall have been a breach
or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the

(f) by the Company, if prior to the Acceptance Time there shall have been a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on

from accepting for payment or paying for Company Common Shares pursuant to the
Offer or consummating the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof and (ii)
is not cured or is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date; _provided_
, that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant under this Agreement;

(g) by Parent, if an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

(h) by the Company, if prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company is in
compliance with its obligations under _Section 8.03_ in all material
respects, (ii) the Company Board has received a Company Acquisition Proposal
that it has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company has
notified Parent in writing that it intends to enter into a definitive

58 (d) Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in the event

constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person
or circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed
to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall

intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing
bodies or entities) at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that, after Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no

stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.



 

60 Section 11.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, _Annex I_ and the
Exhibits hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Purchaser shall each have the option to assign
this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent without the prior written consent of
the Company prior to the Company Stockholder Approval being obtained if such

Purchaser shall remain bound by this Agreement and remain liable for all of

that are required to be performed discharged or complied with following the
Merger Effective Time. 

Section 11.07 _Specific Performance_. Subject to _Section 10.03(d)_, the
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach
of this Agreement, and accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity.

Section 11.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of _Section 8.06_ (which
are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or the
persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such persons).

Section 11.09 _Governing Law; Forum_.

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement,

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules
of conflict of laws.

(b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if said
court lacks jurisdiction by virtue of federal law, any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware_  



 

61   _Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees
not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any action
or proceeding in the manner provided in  _Section 11.02_ or such other
manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

Section 11.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no Representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Party hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section
11.10_.

Section 11.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 11.13 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by
the party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or
be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

Furthermore, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment, and

Agreement) and before acceptance of such Company Common Shares for payment,
any of the following conditions exists and is continuing, regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such condition:



     | (a) |

The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
(other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.03(a),

and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time, as

failure of such representations or warranties to be true and correct (without

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (iii) are set forth in Section 5.03(a) are not true

     | (b) | The Company shall have failed to perform and comply with, in
any material respect, its obligations, agreements and covenants to be
performed or complied with by it under the Agreement on or prior to the
Acceptance Time;

certificate signed by an officer of the Company and certifying as to the
satisfaction by the Company, of the applicable conditions specified in
clauses (a) and (b) immediately above; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | There shall be any injunction, judgment, ruling, order or

part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or
Purchaser (except for any condition which, pursuant to Section 2.01 of the
Agreement, may only be waived with the Companys consent). The failure by
Parent, Purchaser or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right,
the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts
and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Any and all capitalized terms used herein, and not defined herein, shall have
