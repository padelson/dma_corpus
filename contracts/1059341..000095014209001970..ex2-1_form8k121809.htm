Surviving Partnership and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Common Stock or OP Units such amounts as it is required to
deduct  and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax law including any
withholding required under Section 1445 of the Code; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no withholding will be required pursuant to Section 1445
of the Code on payments of the Common Share Merger Consideration if the Common
Stock of the Company is "regularly traded" (within  the meaning of Temporary
Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-9T(d)) during the calendar quarter ending
prior to the quarter in which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs; and
provided further, that no deduction or withholding from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of OP Units shall
be made if such holder is able to provide an affidavit, sworn to and signed
under penalty of perjury, setting forth the holder\'s name, address and
Federal  tax identification number and stating that the holder is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Common Stock or OP Units in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be.

  

Section 2.4 _Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards_. The Company
shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Company Merger Effective
Time, each restricted stock award and each option to acquire shares of Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Stock  Award_ "), outstanding immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
by virtue of the Company Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Stock Award, shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the Stock Award Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock in respect of  such restricted stock awards and options,
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. " _Stock Award
Consideration_ " means (x) in the case of an option, the excess, if any, of
the Common Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase
price of the applicable stock option and (y) in the case of a restricted stock
award, the Common Share Merger Consideration. The payment of the Stock Award 
Consideration to the holder of a Company Stock Award shall be reduced by any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.3(i)_
with respect to such payment. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld
and fully paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity or Governmental
Entities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of
that Company Stock Award for all purposes under this  Agreement. All Company
Stock Awards shall be cancelled and all Company Stock Award Plans shall
terminate at the Company Merger Effective Time.

  8    

not voted in favor of the Company Merger or consented to it in writing and
(ii) has demanded the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has
complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Common Share Merger Consideration in  accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_. At
the Company Merger Effective Time, (x) all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to exist and (y) the holder or holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under
Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.5(a)_ , if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holder\'s shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares and 
(ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the
Company Merger Effective Time into the right to receive the Common Share
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing
such shares in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

  

Section 2.6 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the
obligations of the Company under _Section 5.1_ , in the event that the Company
changes the number of shares of Common Stock or OP Units or other securities
convertible or exchangeable  into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock
or OP Units issued and outstanding prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

ERISA and (ii) each other stock purchase, stock option, phantom equity or

employment, consulting, change-of-control, collective bargaining, bonus,
thirteenth month, hospitalization, medical, dental, vision, vacation, life
insurance, death benefit, sick pay, disability, incentive, deferred

subject to ERISA (including any related funding mechanism now in effect or
required in the future), whether formal or informal, mandated under local Law,
voluntary, private, funded or unfunded, financed by the purchase of insurance,
contributory or non-contributory (excluding hotel-specific bonus plans the
costs of which are subject to a contractual reimbursable obligation of third-
party hotel  owners), under which (A) any current director, officer or
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ "),
whether working in the U.S. or outside of the U.S., has any present or future
right to benefits, or (B) the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, has any present or future Liabilities. All such plans, agreements,
programs, policies, contracts, commitments and arrangements  that are not 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  20    

multiemployer plans within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA are
collectively referred to as the " _Company Benefit Plans_."

  

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, if applicable, the Company

documents and agreements and related trust agreements (or other funding
vehicles), and where a Company Benefit Plan is not otherwise in writing, a
written description of such Company Benefit Plan;  (ii) the most recent

(c) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan
under applicable Law and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan and all
premiums due or payable with respect to insurance contracts funding any
Company Benefit Plan, for any period up to and through the Closing Date, have
been timely made or paid in full, or to the extent not required  to be to be
made or paid on or before the Closing Date, have been properly reflected in
the financial statements of the Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be,
except for failures to make, pay or reflect such contributions that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All amounts
properly accrued as Liabilities or expenses of any Company Benefit Plan have
been properly reflected in the most recent financial statements contained in
the Company\'s  SEC Reports, to the extent required by GAAP, and have been
appropriately reflected on the financial statements of the sponsor of the
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with local law, past practice and generally
accepted accounting principles in each jurisdiction. Since the date of such
financial statements, there has been no amendment or change in interpretation

Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan owns assets (including
cash, insurance contracts and other property) with a fair market value, as of

assumptions provided  by Parent, and as calculated by Parent\'s actuaries,
with respect to all participants covered by such plan.

  

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.18(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any trade or business that, together with the
Company, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b) or (c) of the
Code (each, an " _ERISA  Affiliate_ ") maintains or contributes to: (i) and
has not within the preceding five (5) years maintained or contributed to, or
had during such period the obligation to maintain or contribute to, nor does
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate have any unsatisfied obligation with
respect to, any Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a "single employer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, or any "multiemployer
plan" (within the  meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or any "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code); (ii) any
Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; (iii) any voluntary
employees\' beneficiary association under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code; (iv)
any organization or trust described in Section 501(c)(17) or 501(c)(2)) of the
Code; (v) any welfare benefit fund as defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code);  (vi) any self-insured plan (including any plan pursuant to which a

  21    

control (within the meaning of Section 3(4)) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability that has not been
satisfied in full as a result of a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial

Section 4.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true,
complete and correct copy of (a) an executed equity commitment letter (the "
_THI Commitment Letter_ "), which expressly provides for the Company to be a
third party beneficiary  thereof, pursuant to which THI Inca V LLC (the "
_THI Investor_ ") has committed to provide equity financing (the " _THI
Financing_ ") to Parent in the amount set forth therein, and (b) an executed
equity commitment letter (the " _CG Commitment Letter_ " and together with the

provides for the Company to be a third party beneficiary thereof, pursuant to
which Capital Gathering, LLC (the " _CG Investor_ " and together with the THI
Investor, the " _Equity Investors_ ") has committed to provide equity

The Equity Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or terminated (and no
party thereto has indicated an  intent to so withdraw or terminate) or

the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated
by the Equity Commitment Letters. Taken together with Parent\'s  cash on

Parent\'s, Merger Sub\'s and Merger Partnership\'s obligations under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof and

for discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall provide Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) with the
identity of such Person and a copy of such Takeover Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available, a description of such
Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or request). The Company shall keep
Parent  reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48
hours) of the status of any such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request and any related communications to or by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or its Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement, which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent or requires the  Company to negotiate on an exclusive
basis (other than with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business
and unrelated to a Takeover Proposal) with such other Person. The Company
shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive,
amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, seek enforcement of the provisions of any such  agreement,
in each case, except to the extent the board of directors of the Company (or
any Authorized Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Laws.

  

(d) Subject to the Company\'s compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 5.4_ , and only until the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
Company and its board of directors (or any Authorized Committee) shall be
permitted to:

  

(1) engage in discussions with a Person who has made a written Takeover
Proposal not solicited in violation of this _Section 5.4_ (x) to clarify the
terms of such Takeover Proposal or (y) if, prior to taking such action, (A)
the board of directors of the Company (or any Authorized Committee) 
determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such
Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and
(B) the board of directors of the Company (or any Authorized Committee)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Laws;

  

(2) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to a Person who has made a written Takeover
Proposal not solicited in violation of this _Section 5.4_ if, prior to taking
such action, (A) the board of directors of the Company (or any  Authorized 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  49    

Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors)
that such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, (B) the board of directors of the Company (or any Authorized
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its  fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Laws and (C) the Company (1) has caused such Person
to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2) promptly
discloses the same such non-public information to Parent if not previously
disclosed;

  

(3) in response to an Intervening Event, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, if the board of directors of the Company (or any
Authorized Committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the  stockholders
of the Company under applicable Laws; _provided_ , that (A) the Company has
provided to Parent five (5) Business Days\' prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (B) during such five (5) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages  in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need for such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

  

(4) in response to the receipt of any written Takeover Proposal not
solicited in violation of this _Section 5.4_ , approve, endorse or recommend a
Takeover Proposal and, in connection therewith, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, if the board of directors of the Company (or any
Authorized  Committee) (A) has determined in good faith, after consultation
with a nationally-recognized financial advisor (which may be the Company
Financial Advisor), that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (B) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such actions would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders
of the Company under applicable Laws;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to a Superior
Proposal until after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Parent\'s receipt
of written notice from the Company (a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Notice_ ") advising Parent that the board of directors of the Company (or
such  Authorized Committee) intends to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Company Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new five (5) Business Day period);
and _provided_ _further_ that in  determining whether to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, the board of
directors of the Company (or such 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  50    

Authorized Committee) shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to a Company Adverse Recommendation
Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such third party Takeover Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; or

  

(5) subject to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.4(a)_ , enter into an agreement providing for the implementation of
a Superior Proposal.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the board
of directors of the Company (and any Authorized Committee) shall be permitted
to (i) disclose to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) make
such other public disclosure  that it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is required under applicable Laws,
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor its board of directors
shall (x) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares
of Company Stock in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve, endorse or recommend any  Takeover Proposal) or (y) withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Board Recommendation, unless in the case of each of
clauses (x) and (y), the requirements of _Section 5.4(d)(4)_ have been
satisfied.

Section 5.7

     |  

_Company Proxy Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare a draft of the Company Proxy Statement. The Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such draft, and once such draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to each of
Parent and the Company, the Company shall file the  Company Proxy Statement

respond to any comments on the Company Proxy Statement or requests for
additional information from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of
any such comments or requests, and (ii) cause the Company Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as  promptly as practicable

upon the receipt of any such comments or requests and (B) provide Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or  Representatives
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, so that the Company
Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  52    

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  prior to responding to any comments or
requests of the SEC or the filing or mailing of the Company Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Company (x) shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the
Company Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall
include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.

  

(c) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board

hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following the

Adverse Recommendation Change. Subject to _Section 5.4(d)_ , the Company shall

     |  

Section 5.9

     |  

_Employees; Benefit Plans_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide Company Employees (other than those employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement) who are employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as
of the Company  Merger Effective Time (" _Active Employees_ ") with
compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate as those
provided under the Company Benefit Plans in effect at the Company Merger
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the
amendment or termination of any specific plan, program or  arrangement,
require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the
securities of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or interfere with the
Surviving Corporation\'s right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Active Employee for any
reason for which the Company could  have terminated such person prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time.

  

(b) Parent and its Affiliates shall continue to maintain and administer
all Company Benefit Plans (including, without limitation, any severance,
change of control and similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be  permitted by
such Company Benefit Plans, applicable Law, 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  53    

and this Agreement. During the Continuation Period, Parent and its Affiliates
shall provide all Active Employees who suffer a qualifying termination of
employment with severance benefits no less favorable than those that would
have been provided to such Active Employees under the Company\'s severance
policy as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.

  

(c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Affiliates providing benefits to any Active Employees after the Company Merger
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Active Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company, Subsidiaries and
Affiliates  before the Company Merger Effective Time (including predecessor
or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its
Affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Active Employee was entitled, before the Company Merger Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plans
(except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits).
In addition, and without limiting the  generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Active Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in
which such Active Employee participated immediately before the Company Merger
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for
purposes  of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Active Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Active Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Active Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such Employee\'s  participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Active Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  

(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained herein with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit
of Parent and the Company and their respective Affiliates shall not create any
right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees,
participants or former participants in any Company Benefit  Plans or any
beneficiary thereof, or any other third parties. In addition, except as
expressly provided herein, nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Company Employee any right to employment or
continued employment with the Company, Subsidiary, or Surviving Corporation or
any rights under any Company Benefit Plan, including severance benefits, by
reason of this Agreement.

Section 5.10

     |  

_Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Partnership shall
cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
now existing in favor of any present or former director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in  the Company Organizational Documents or in agreements between an
Indemnified Party and the Company or one of 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  54    

its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement to
survive the Mergers and to continue in full force and effect for a period of
not less than six (6) years after the Company Merger Effective Time.

  

(b) After the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify all
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services
as directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time. If any  Indemnified Party is or becomes
involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter occurring prior to
or at the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall pay promptly after they
are incurred such Indemnified Party\'s reasonable legal fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parent\'s
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if
required by the DGCL, to repay such legal fees, costs and expenses if it is 
ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality
of  the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Legal Action except to the extent that
two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in
the outcome of such action.

  

(c) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Partnership shall,
jointly and severally, (i) maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after
the Partnership Merger Effective Time, if available, the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_   that the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Partnership may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are not less advantageous) or (ii) obtain as of the
Company Merger Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time with at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no
less advantageous, in  each case, with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred before or at the Company Merger Effective
Time so long as Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Partnership are not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 250% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date
of this Agreement (such 250% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). The
Company  represents that such annual premium amount is set forth in _Section
5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. If Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Partnership are unable to obtain the insurance
described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the
Maximum Premium, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Partnership shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable
insurance  as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

(d) The covenants contained in this _Section 5.10_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, 
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  55    

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Partnership or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties  and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors or assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Partnership, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.10_.

  

Section 5.11 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
applicable Laws, each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or  cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
ensure that the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ are satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable.

Section 5.12

     |  

_Consents; Filings_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Laws, each of Parent, the Company and Operating
Partnership shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) use its
best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or other authorizations, and
make any filings and notifications required in  connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) thereafter make any other
submissions either required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or the
Company, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under (A) the Exchange Act, (B) the HSR Act, if applicable, (C) the DGCL and
DRULPA, (D) the NYSE rules and regulations and (E) any other applicable Laws.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult  with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings and notifications, including by
providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing. The parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this _Section 5.12_ or _Section 5.6_ as "outside counsel  only."
Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

  

(b) If applicable, in furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, the parties shall file, or cause to be filed by
their respective ultimate parent entities, with the Federal Trade Commission
and the Department of Justice, the notifications required to be filed under
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions  contemplated in this Agreement,
which notifications will include a request for early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act. The parties agree further to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entity any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act. Neither Parent nor the Company shall consent to any voluntary extension
of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  56    

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party
upon receipt of any communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or any
of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for  additional
information from any such Governmental Entity that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such
request. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall
provide to the other (or the other\'s advisors) upon request copies of all
correspondence between such  party and any Governmental Entity relating to
the transactions described herein. The parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this _Section 5.12(c)_ as "outside counsel only." In addition, to
the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and
meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the transactions described
herein  shall include representatives of Parent and the Company. Subject to
applicable Laws, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
regarding the transactions described herein by or on behalf of any party.
Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings
or agreements (oral or written) which  Parent proposes to make or enter into
with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objections that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Laws.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require or obligate
Parent to, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (i) agree or otherwise become subject to any restrictions, conditions,
limitations, licensing requirements, or other understandings on or with
respect to the assets or the operation of the business of Parent, the Company,
or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries, or (ii) agree or otherwise be required
to  sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate (through the establishment or
a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of all or any portion of the business,
assets, or operations of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries, except to the extent any such foregoing action would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) Each of the Company, Operating Partnership and the Purchaser Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In seeking third party consents, the parties shall cooperate
and consult with each other to convey a consistent  message regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to all third parties. In the event
that any third party consent described above shall fail to be obtained, each
of the Company and Operating Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, in consultation with Parent, to minimize any adverse effect
resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Company
Merger Effective Time from the failure to obtain such consent.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a
Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or minimizing any adverse effect from the failure to obtain such
consent or preserving intact any relationship, 

  



  

 

  

  



  

 

  



  

  57    

(i) without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any material amount of cash or other consideration,
make any material commitment or incur any material Liability or other material
obligation due to  such Person and (ii) none of the Purchaser Parties, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited or
whose relationship is being preserved any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation.

  

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any such  press

     |  

**5.3.**

---|---|--- 
   

  

**5.3.1.** No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable
to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, provided that this provision shall not eliminate
or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach of the director\'s 
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provision shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation existing at the time of  such repeal or modification.

  



  

**5.3.2** To the extent not prohibited by law, the Corporation shall
indemnify any person who is or was made, or threatened to be made, a party to
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "
**Proceeding** "), whether  civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
including, without limitation, an action by or in the right of the Corporation
to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person, or
a person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation, or, at the request of the Corporation, is or
was serving as a director or officer of any other corporation or in a capacity
with comparable authority or responsibilities  for any partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (an " **Other
Entity** ") against judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid in
settlement and costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys\' fees,
disbursements and other charges). Persons who are not directors or officers of
the Corporation (or otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
preceding sentence) may be  similarly indemnified in respect of service to
the Corporation or to an Other Entity at the request of the Corporation to the
extent the Corporation determines to provide such 

  

   

indemnification. The Corporation shall reimburse or advance to any director or
officer or other person entitled to indemnification hereunder the funds
necessary for payment of expenses, including attorneys\' fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Proceeding, in advance of the
final disposition of such Proceeding; provided, however, that, if required by
the Delaware General Corporation  Law, such expenses incurred by or on behalf
of any director or officer or other person may be paid in advance of the final
disposition of a Proceeding only upon receipt by the Corporation of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer (or other person
indemnified hereunder), to repay any such amount so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right of appeal that such director, officer or other person is  not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses.

  



  

**5.3.3** The rights to indemnification and reimbursement or
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 5.3
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking
indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses may have or
hereafter be  entitled under any statute, this Certificate of Incorporation,
the bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors
or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office. The rights to
indemnification and reimbursement or advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Section 5.3.3 shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer (or other  person indemnified hereunder)
and shall inure to the benefit of the executors, administrators, legatees and
distributees of such person.

  



  

**5.3.4** The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of an Other Entity,
against  any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such
person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person\'s status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
against such liability under the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ , the bylaws
or under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other
provision of law.

  



  

**5.3.5** The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses conferred in this _Section 5.3_ shall be contract rights and such
rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee, or agent and shall  inure to the benefit of the
indemnitee\'s heirs, executors and administrators. No repeal or modification
of this _Section 5.3_ shall affect any rights or obligations with respect to
any state of facts then or theretofore existing or thereafter arising or any
proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or
in part upon any such state of facts.

  



  

**5.3.6** The rights to indemnification and reimbursement or
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this _Section
5.3_ shall be enforceable by any person entitled to such indemnification or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses  in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The burden of proving that such indemnification or reimbursement
or advancement of expenses is not 

  

   

appropriate shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses
is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its directors, its independent legal counsel and its stockholders)
that such person is not  entitled to such indemnification or reimbursement or
advancement of expenses shall constitute a defense to the action or create a
presumption that such person is not so entitled. Such a person shall also be
indemnified for any expenses incurred in connection with successfully
establishing his or her right to such indemnification or reimbursement or
advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding.

  



  

**5.3.7** Any director or officer of the Corporation serving in any
capacity of (a) another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled
to vote in the election of its directors is held, directly or indirectly, by
the Corporation or (b) any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any 
corporation referred to in clause (a) shall be deemed to be doing so at the
request of the Corporation.

  

       

**Article 6.** 

     |  

**AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS**

    
---|--- 
   

  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is
expressly authorized and empowered to adopt, amend and repeal the bylaws of
the Corporation.

  

**Article 7.** **RESERVATION OF RIGHT TO AMEND CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION**

  

The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to
amend, alter, change, or repeal any provision contained in, or amend and
restate, this Certificate of Incorporation, and other provisions authorized by
the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or
inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights,
preferences,  and privileges of any nature conferred upon stockholders,
directors, or any other persons by and pursuant to this Certificate of
Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject
to the rights reserved in this **Article 7.**

  

   

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF,** the Corporation has caused this Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its ___________ this ___ day of ___________________, 2010.

     |  

**Place of Meetings**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place as may be fixed
from time to time by the Board of Directors, or the President. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Board of Directors may determine that the meeting shall not
be held at any place, but may instead be held by means of remote
communication.

  

       



     |  

**2.2.**

     |  

**Annual Meetings**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting,
the Corporation shall hold annual meetings of stockholders, commencing with
the year 2010, on such date and at such time as shall be designated from time
to time by the Board of Directors or the President, at which stockholders
shall elect a Board of Directors and transact such other business as may 
properly be brought before the meeting. If a written consent electing
directors is less than unanimous, such action by written consent may be in
lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of the directorships to which
directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the effective time of
such action are vacant and are filled by such action.

**Special Meetings**

  



    
---|---|--- 
   

  

  

Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless
otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the Board of Directors or
the President.

  

       



     |  

**2.4.**

     |  

**Notice of Meetings**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Notice of any meeting of stockholders, stating the place, if any, date and
hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such meeting, and (if it is a special meeting) the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to
vote at such meeting  not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the
date of the meeting (except to the extent that such notice is waived or is not
required as provided in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " **DGCL** ") or these Bylaws). Such notice shall be given in accordance
with, and shall be deemed effective as set forth in, Sections 222 and 232 (or
any successor section or sections) of the  DGCL.

  

       



     |  

**2.5.**

     |  

**Waivers of Notice**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Whenever the giving of any notice is required by statute, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof signed by the person
or persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver thereof by electronic
transmission by the person entitled to said notice, delivered to the
Corporation, whether before or after the event as to which such notice is
required, shall be deemed  equivalent to notice. Attendance of a stockholder
at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice (1) of such meeting, except
when the stockholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the
meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (2) (if it is a special
meeting) of consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not
within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the
stockholder objects to considering the matter at  the beginning of the
meeting.

  

       



     |  

**2.6.**

     |  

**Business at Special Meetings**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to
the purposes stated in the notice (except to the extent that such notice is
waived or is not required as provided in the DGCL or these Bylaws).

  

       



     |  

**2.7.**

     |  

**List of Stockholders**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

After the record date for a meeting of stockholders has been fixed, at least
ten days before such meeting, the officer who has charge of the stock ledger
of the Corporation shall make a list of all stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each
stockholder (but not the electronic mail address or other electronic contact 
information, unless the Board of Directors so directs) and the number of
shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be 

  



  

  

\- 2 -

  



  

  



    

  

open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the
meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (1) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (2) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the  Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
such list shall also, for the duration of the meeting, be produced and kept
open to the examination of any stockholder who is present at the time and
place of the meeting. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then such list shall also be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information  required to access such list shall
be provided with the notice of the meeting.

  

       



     |  

**2.8.**

     |  

**Quorum at Meetings**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Stockholders may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum exists
with respect to that matter. Except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled
to vote at the meeting, and who are present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the  stockholders for the
transaction of business. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes
or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or
series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that
matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting (other than
solely to object (1) to holding the meeting or transacting business at  the
meeting, or (2) (if it is a special meeting) to consideration of a particular
matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in
the meeting notice), it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the
remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new
record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. The holders of a
majority of the voting shares represented at a meeting, whether or not a
quorum is present, may  adjourn such meeting from time to time.

  

       



     |  

**2.9.**

     |  

**Voting and Proxies**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Unless otherwise provided in the DGCL or in the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation, and subject to the other provisions of these Bylaws, each
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote on each matter, in person or by
proxy, for each share of the Corporation's capital stock that has voting power
and that is held by such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted or acted  upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A duly executed appointment of proxy shall be irrevocable if the
appointment form states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it
is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.
If authorized by the Board of Directors, and subject to such guidelines as the
Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically
present at a meeting  of stockholders may, by means of remote communication,
participate in a meeting of stockholders and be deemed present in person and
vote at such meeting whether such meeting is held at a designated place or
solely by means of remote 

  

  

\- 3 -

  



  

  



    

  

communication, provided that (1) the Corporation implements reasonable
measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at
the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder,
(2) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters  submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings, and (3) if any stockholder or proxyholder
votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a
record of such vote or other action is maintained by the Corporation.

  

       



     |  

**2.10.**

     |  

**Required Vote**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, all matters shall be
determined, adopted and approved by the affirmative vote (which need not be by
ballot) of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote with respect to the
matter, unless the proposed action is one upon which, by express provision
of  statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is
specified and required, in which case such express provision shall govern and
control with respect to that vote on that matter. If the Certificate of
Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share, on any
matter, every reference in these Bylaws to a majority or other proportion of
stock, voting stock or shares shall refer to a majority or other proportion of
the votes of such stock, voting  stock or shares. Where a separate vote by a
class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, directors shall be elected by a plurality of
the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

  

       



     |  

**2.11.**

     |  

**Action Without a Meeting**

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

Any action required or permitted to be taken at a stockholders' meeting may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if the
action is taken by persons who would be entitled to vote at a meeting and who
hold shares having voting power equal to not less than the minimum number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a  meeting
at which all shares entitled to vote were present and voted. The action must
be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken,
signed by the stockholders entitled to take action without a meeting, and
delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed by the DGCL for
inclusion in the minute book. No consent shall be effective to take the
corporate action specified unless the number of consents required to take such
action are delivered to the  Corporation within sixty days of the delivery of
the earliest-dated consent. A telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission consenting to such action and transmitted by a stockholder or
proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or
proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes
of this **Section 2.11** , provided that any such telegram, cablegram or
other  electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information
from which the Corporation can determine 

  



  

 

  

\- 4 -

  



  

 

  



    

  

(1) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons
authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (2) the date on which
such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted
such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such
telegram,  cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be
deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have
been delivered until such consent is delivered to the Corporation in
accordance with Section 228(d)(1) of the DGCL. Written notice of the action
taken shall be given in accordance with the DGCL to all stockholders who do
not participate in taking the action who would  have been entitled to notice
if such action had been taken at a meeting having a record date on the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation.

stockholders) that such person is not entitled to such indemnification or

**FORMS OF LIMITED GUARANTEES**

  



  



  



  

   



  

**LIMITED GUARANTEE**

  

Limited Guarantee, dated as of December 18, 2009 (this " _Limited Guarantee_
"), by Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels (Group) Company Limited (the "
_Guarantor_ "), in favor of Interstate Hotels and Resorts, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the  " _Company_ "), and Interstate Operating Company, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the " _OP_ " and, together with the Company, the
" _Guaranteed Parties_ ").

  

1. _LIMITED GUARANTEE_. To induce the Guaranteed Parties to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger  Agreement_ "; capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement), by and among Hotel Acquisition Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), HAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _MergerCo_ "), HAC Merger Partnership, LP, a Delaware  limited partnership (" _Merger Partnership_ "), and the Guaranteed Parties, the Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Guaranteed Parties, the due and punctual performance and discharge of the payment obligations of Parent and the other Purchaser Parties under the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Obligations_ ");  _provided_ , that in no event shall the Guarantor's liability under this Limited Guarantee exceed $12,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "), it being understood that this Limited Guarantee may not be enforced without giving effect to the Cap. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Guarantor acknowledges that its liability hereunder shall extend to 50% of the Obligations (subject to  the Cap).

  

2. _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. The Guaranteed Parties shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Parent becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Parties to so file shall not affect the  Guarantor's obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Guaranteed Parties in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Obligations as if such payment had not been made. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collectibility. 

  

3. _CHAN_ _GES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS_. The Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Parties may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the  Obligations, and may also make any agreement with any of the Purchaser Parties or with any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Guaranteed Parties, on the one hand, and Parent or the other Purchaser Parties, on the other hand, or any such other Person without  in any way impairing or affecting the Guarantor's obligations under this Limited Guarantee. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of the Guaranteed Parties to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or the other Purchaser Parties or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the  Merger Agreement; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement or any

other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with
any of the Obligations; (c) the addition, substitution or release of any
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
(d) any change in the existence, structure or ownership of Parent or the other
Purchaser Parties or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated  by the Merger Agreement; (e) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent or the other
Purchaser Parties or any other Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (f) any lack of validity or
enforceability of the Merger Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating
thereto; (g) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the
Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, the  other Purchaser Parties
or the Guaranteed Parties, whether in connection with the Obligations or
otherwise; (h) the adequacy of any other means the Guaranteed Parties may have
of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations (i) any other act or omission
which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or
otherwise operate as a release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may
be done without notice to the Guarantor; or (j) any other  event of
circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing (other than final
payment in full of the Obligations). To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising
by reason of any Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by
the Guaranteed Parties. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of
the acceptance of this Limited Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment,
demand  for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and
protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind,
all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to
require the marshalling of assets of Parent or the other Purchaser Parties or
any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and all suretyship defenses  generally (other than fraud or
willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, defenses to the
payment of the Obligations that are available to the Purchaser Parties under
the Merger Agreement or breach by the Guaranteed Parties of this Limited
Guarantee). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct
and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee are 
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

  

The Guaranteed Parties hereby covenant and agree that they shall not
institute, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to institute, any
proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, against the
Guarantor or any of its former, current or future directors, officers, agents,
Affiliates or employees,  or against any of the former, current or future
general or limited partners, members, managers or stockholders of the
Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof or against any former, current or future
directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners, members,
managers or stockholders of any of the foregoing, except for claims (i)
against the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee, (ii) against Parent and
the other Purchaser Parties under the Merger Agreement, (iii)  against
Capital Gathering, LLC under the CG Commitment Letter, (iv) against Thayer
Hotel Investors V-A, L.P. under the Thayer Limited Guarantee or (v) against
THI Inca V LLC under the THI Commitment Letter. The Guarantor hereby covenants
and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to
institute, any proceedings asserting that this Limited Guarantee is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects
of  bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and general
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in

  



  

 

  

       



     |

---|--- 
   

  



  

 

  

   

equity or at law). The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against
Parent, the other Purchaser Parties or any other Person interested in the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that arise from the
existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations
under or in  respect of this Limited Guarantee or any other agreement in
connection therewith, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Guaranteed Parties against Parent,
the other Purchaser Parties or such other Person, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law,
including, without limitation, the  right to take or receive from Parent, the
other Purchaser Parties or such other Person, directly or indirectly, in cash
or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Limited Guarantee shall
have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to the
Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence  at any time
prior to the payment in full in cash of the Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Limited Guarantee, such amount shall be received and held
in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties, shall be segregated from
other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or
delivered to the Guaranteed Parties in the same form as so received (with any
necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the
Obligations and  all other amounts payable under this Limited Guarantee, in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, whether matured or
unmatured, or to be held as collateral for any Obligations or other amounts
payable under this Limited Guarantee thereafter arising.

  

4. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure on the part of the Guaranteed Parties to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Guaranteed Parties of any right, remedy or power  hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Guaranteed Parties or allowed them by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Parties at any time or from time to time.

  

5. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that:

Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than fraud or willful
misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, defenses to the payment
of the Obligations that are available to the Purchaser Parties under the
Merger Agreement or breach by the Guaranteed Parties of this Limited
Guarantee). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct
and indirect benefits from the transactions  contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

  

The Guaranteed Parties hereby covenant and agree that they shall not
institute, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to institute, any
proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, against the
Guarantor or any of its former, current or future directors, officers, agents,
Affiliates or employees,  or against any of the former, current or future
general or limited partners, members, managers or stockholders of the
Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof or against any former, current or future
directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners, members,
managers or stockholders of any of the foregoing, except for claims (i)
against the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee, (ii) against Parent and
the other Purchaser Parties under the Merger Agreement, (iii)  against THI V
Inca LLC under the THI Commitment Letter, (iv) against Shanghai Jin Jiang
International Hotels (Group) Company Limited under the Jin Jiang Limited
Guarantee or (v) against Capital Gathering, LLC under the CG Commitment
Letter. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to institute, any proceedings asserting
that this Limited Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance
with its terms,  subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance,

reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or
hereafter acquire against Parent, the other Purchaser Parties or any other
Person interested in the  transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
that arise from the existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of the
Guarantor's obligations under or in respect of this Limited Guarantee or any
other agreement in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any
right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Guaranteed Parties against Parent, the other Purchaser  Parties or such other
Person, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from Parent, the other Purchaser Parties or such other Person,
directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any
other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right,
unless and until all of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under 
this Limited Guarantee shall have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. If
any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Limited Guarantee, such
amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed
Parties, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor
and shall forthwith be paid  or delivered to the Guaranteed Parties in the
same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be
credited and applied to the Obligations and all other amounts payable under
this Limited Guarantee, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
whether matured or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for any Obligations
or other amounts payable under this Limited Guarantee thereafter arising.

  

4. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure on the part of the Guaranteed Parties to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Guaranteed Parties of any right, remedy or power  hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Guaranteed Parties or allowed them by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Parties at any time or from time to time.

  

5. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that:

  

(a) the execution, delivery and performance of this Limited Guarantee
have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any

(b) all consents, approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with

8. _CONTINUING GUARANTEE_. This Limited Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its successors and assigns until the Obligations are satisfied in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Limited Guarantee shall terminate and the Guarantor shall have  no further obligations under this Limited Guarantee as of the earliest of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) one year from the date of this Limited Guarantee (except to the extent that, prior to such anniversary date, the Guaranteed Parties shall have provided written notice to the Guarantor of claims under this Limited Guarantee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Guaranteed Parties or any of their respective Affiliates assert in any litigation or other  proceeding that the provisions of Section 1 hereof limiting the Guarantor's liability to the Cap or the provisions of this Section 8 or Section 9 hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, or asserting any theory of liability against the Guarantor or any Affiliates of the Guarantor with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement other than (a) liability of the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee (as limited by the provisions  of Section 1), (b) liability of Parent and the other Purchaser Parties under the Merger Agreement, (c) liability of THI V Inca LLC under the THI Commitment Letter, (d) liability of Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels (Group) Company Limited under the Jin Jiang Limited Guarantee or (e) liability of Capital Gathering, LLC under the CG Commitment Letter, then (i) the obligations of the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee shall terminate  _ab_ _initio_ and be null and void, (ii) if the Guarantor has previously made any payments under this Limited Guarantee, it shall be entitled to recover such payments, and (iii) neither the Guarantor nor any Affiliate of any Guarantor shall have any liability to the Guaranteed Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or under this Limited  Guarantee; provided, however, that if the Guarantor asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that this Limited Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), then, to the extent the  Guaranteed Parties prevail in such litigation or proceeding, the Guarantor shall pay on demand all reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses of the Guaranteed Parties in connection with such litigation or proceeding.

  

9. _NO RECOURSE_. The Guaranteed Parties agree that neither they nor any of their respective Affiliates have any right of recovery against the Guarantor or any of its former, current or future directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners, members, managers or stockholders  through Parent or the other Purchaser Parties or otherwise, whether by piercing of the

corporate veil, by or through a claim on behalf of Parent or the other
Purchaser Parties against the Guarantor or an Affiliate, or otherwise, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by an legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise, in each
case except for their rights to recover (i) from the Guarantor under and to
the extent provided  in this Limited Guarantee and subject to the Cap and the
other limitations described herein, (ii) from Parent and the other Purchaser
Parties under the Merger Agreement (iii) from THI V Inca LLC under the THI
Commitment Letter, (iv) from Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels (Group)
Company Limited under the Jin Jiang Limited Guarantee or (v) from Capital
Gathering, LLC under the CG Commitment Letter. Recourse against the Guarantor
under this Limited Guarantee shall  be the exclusive remedy of the Guaranteed
Parties and their Affiliates against the Guarantor and any of its former,
current or future directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited
partners, members, managers or stockholders (in each case other than Parent,
the other Purchaser Parties and THI V Inca LLC) in respect of any liabilities
or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby. Except as  contemplated under Section
6, nothing set forth in this Limited Guarantee shall affect or be construed to
confer or give any Person other than the Guarantor and the Guaranteed Parties
(including any Person acting in a representative capacity) any rights or
remedies against any Person.

  

10. _CONFIDENTIALITY_. Except as required by Law, the Guaranteed Parties agree to keep this Limited Guarantee confidential and further agree not to file this Limited Guarantee with any Governmental Authority.

  

11. _GOVERNING LAW_. This Limited Guarantee shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law. The parties to this Limited Guarantee (a) irrevocably submit to  the personal jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (b) waive any claim of improper venue or any claim that those courts are an inconvenient forum.

  

12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

13. _COUNTERPARTS_. This Limited Guarantee may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall  constitute one and the same instrument.
