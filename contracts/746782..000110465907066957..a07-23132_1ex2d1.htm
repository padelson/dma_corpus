NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I**

  

 **The Offer**

  

1.1 _ The Offer._

  

(a) _ Terms of Offer; Conditions to Offer._ Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated pursuant to Article VII hereof, as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof and on a date reasonably acceptable to
the Company (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to
purchase all of the Company Common Stock at a price per share of Company
Common Stock, subject to the terms of Section 1.1(b) hereof, equal to the
Offer Price, without interest. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for
payment and to pay for any Company Common Stock

       

tendered (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for
payment and to pay for any Company Common Stock tendered) shall be subject
only to (i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the
then scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time
to time pursuant to Section 1.1(c) hereof), there be validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of shares
of Company Common Stock that, together with all other shares of Company
Common Stock then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any), represents at
least a majority of (x) all then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
_plus_ (y) all shares of Company Common Stock issued or issuable upon the
exercise of all then outstanding Company Options with an exercise price that
is equal to or less than $17.87, _plus_ (z) all shares of Company Common
Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
other securities or other rights (other than the Company Options) that are
exercisable, convertible or exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock
and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex C_ hereto. Parent and Merger
Sub expressly reserve the right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act,
to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided
by this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub may make any change to the terms and conditions of the
Offer that (A) decreases the Offer Price, (B) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, (C) reduces the number of shares of
Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer, (D) imposes conditions to
the Offer in addition to the conditions to the Offer set forth in  _Annex C_
hereto, (E) amends the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex
C_ hereto so as to broaden the scope of such conditions to the Offer, (F)
extends the Offer in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 1.1(c) hereof or (G) amends or waives the Minimum
Condition. The conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex C_ hereto are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and
Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their
sole discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. The
failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time prior to accepting the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to Section 1.1(d).

  

(b) _ Adjustments to Offer Price._ The Offer Price shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance
for payment of, and payment for, the Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer.

  

(c) _ Extension and Expiration of Offer._ Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Offer shall expire at
midnight, New York Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days (for
this purpose calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act); _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (i) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or
the NASDAQ that is applicable to the Offer and (ii) in the event that any of
the conditions to the Offer, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth on _Annex C_ hereto, are not satisfied or waived as of
any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer for successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days each in
order to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this
Section 1.1(c), in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Termination Date; and _provided further_ , that the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 1.1(c) shall not be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Article VII hereof.

        

(d) _ Payment for Shares of Company Common Stock._ Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer, as promptly as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with Section 1.1(c) hereof).
The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to
the holder thereof in cash without interest, subject to reduction only for
any back-up withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be
withheld by the Company or Merger Sub on behalf of such holder.

  

(e) _ Subsequent Offering Period._ Merger Sub may (but shall not be
required to), and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right to, extend the
Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty
(20) business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Section
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) immediately following the expiration of
the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for
payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as so extended by any such subsequent
offering period, as promptly as practicable after any such shares of Company
Common Stock are tendered during such subsequent offering period. The Offer
Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as so extended by any such
subsequent offering period, shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash
without interest, **** subject to reduction only for any applicable back-
up withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld by
the Company or Merger Sub on behalf of such holder.

(collectively, the " _Company Stockholders_ "). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5.4 hereof, the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents may include

Company Board set forth in Section 1.2(a) hereof. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information

Offer Documents so as to enable Parent to comply with its obligations
under Section 1.1(a). Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act
and all other Applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders, shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

respective commercially reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to
deliver) to the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from
such information then in their possession or control.

  

(d) _ Rights of First Refusal._ Solely in connection with the tender
and purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
the consummation of the Merger, the Company hereby waives any and all rights
of first refusal it may have with respect to shares of Company Common Stock

unvested shares, if any, that may be held by Persons pursuant to the grant of
restricted stock purchase rights or following the exercise of stock options.

  

1.3 _ Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange
Act._

  

(a) _ Composition of Company Board._ Subject to compliance with
Applicable Law, effective upon the initial acceptance for payment by Merger
Sub of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not, unless the
context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its
rights under this Section 1.3(a)) and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company
Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect
to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the shares of
Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of
which is the total number of then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.
Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the size of the
Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the
resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board. From time to time after the Appointment Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by
Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where
appropriate) as is on the Company Board on (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and
(iii) each committee of each such board of directors of each Subsidiary of
the Company, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.
Solely for purposes of this Section 1.3, any and all members of the Company
Board immediately prior to such appointments by Parent who remain on the
Company Board after such appointments by Parent shall be referred to as "
_Continuing Directors_ " and each as a " _Continuing Director_."

  

(b) _ Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act._ The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to this Section 1.3
and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required
under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.3. Parent shall provide to the Company in writing, and
be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, directors, officers and affiliates, required by such Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1.

  

(c) _ Required Approvals of Continuing Directors._ Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that
Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.3(a) hereof and there shall be any
Continuing Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors
(or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing
Director) shall be required in order to (i) amend or terminate this
Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this
Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) amend the Companys
Restated Articles of Organization, (iii) change the Company Board
Recommendation, (iv) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the
obligations or other acts of

        

Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (v) waive any of the Companys
rights under this Agreement or (vi) make any other determination with respect
to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger. In the event that there are no Continuing Directors
or if the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.3(c) are invalid or
incapable of being enforced under Applicable Law, then neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall take or approve any of the actions referenced in clauses
(i)-(vi) of the preceding sentence, inclusive.

  

1.4 _ Top-Up Option._

  

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option
(the _"_ Top-Up Option _"),_ exercisable only on or after the Appointment
Time, to purchase that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-
Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned
by Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more
than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (assuming the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares and the exercise of all outstanding
exercisable options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock with an
exercise price equal to or less than $17.87) at a price per share equal to
the Offer Price;  _provided, however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, Merger Sub would own more than 90%
of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding; and _provided
further, however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable
for a number of Top-Up Option Shares (i) in excess of the Companys then
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (giving effect to
shares of Company Common Stock reserved or issuance under the Company Stock
Plans as though such shares were outstanding) or (ii) that would require
approval of the Company Stockholders under applicable NASDAQ rules.

  

(b) Merger Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at
any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event and prior to the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms. For purposes of this Agreement, a _"_ Top-Up
Exercise Event _"_ shall occur only upon Merger Subs acceptance of Company
Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer or acquisition of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer constituting at least 80% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding.

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of
the Securities Act.

Section 2.8.

  

(c) Each share of Parent-Owned Stock at the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and no Merger
Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.0025 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. The stock certificates evidencing ownership of such shares of
common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(e) If prior to the Effective Time the Company should (after obtaining the
consent required by Section 5.1) split, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in
Company Common Stock, or otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any
other securities, or make any other such stock dividend or distribution in
capital stock of the Company in respect of the Company Common Stock, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price or the number
of shares of Company Common Stock, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend, reclassification or other distribution or
change.

  

2.7 _ Treatment of Options._

  

(a) Upon and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company
Common Stock then outstanding (each, a " _Company Option_ ") to the extent
then exercisable (after giving effect to any acceleration resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), at an exercise price per share
less than the Merger Consideration (each such Company Option, a " _Cashed Out
Option_ "), shall entitle the holder thereof to receive from Parent as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess of
the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such Company Option (with the aggregate amount of
such payment rounded up to the nearest cent, less applicable taxes, if any,
required by Applicable Law to be withheld by the Company or Merger Sub on
behalf of such holder).

  

(b) Upon and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, each Company Option other than a Cashed Out Option, granted
under any Company Stock Plan and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into an option to acquire such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Converted Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
Merger Consideration by (2) the average of the closing prices of one (1)
share of Parent Common Stock, as quoted on NASDAQ for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock. The terms and conditions of the Converted Option,
including the vesting schedule thereof (except to the extent otherwise
provided in any agreement between the Company and the holder of such
Converted Option), shall otherwise remain the same as the terms and
conditions of the Company Option, except that the exercise price per share of
each Converted Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained

        

by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of such Converted Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent.

  

(c) On the Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
Converted Options and shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Converted Options remain outstanding.

  

2.8 _ Exchange of Certificates._

  

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

  

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.6, an amount of cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Parent-Owned Stock) (such
cash amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

(c) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub will use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Payment Agent
to send to each record holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.6(c)), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent) and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.6. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate upon
surrender thereof to the Payment Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Payment Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.6. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.6. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.6(a) shall be issued with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock to such a transferee only if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Payment Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid.

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid
upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock.

  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for nine (9) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation and Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)

        

the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.6.

  

(f) _ No Liability._ To the extent required by Applicable Law, none
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

2.9 _ Investment of the Exchange Fund._ Any funds included in the
Exchange Fund may be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent;
_provided, that_ such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  

2.10 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate or other documentation (including an
indemnity in customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Payment
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  

2.11 _ Withholding Rights._ Each of the Payment Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be.

  

2.12 _ Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

2.13 _ Stock Transfer Books._ At the close of business, New York time,
on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
Applicable Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to
the Payment Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

 **ARTICLE III**

  

 **Representations and Warranties of the Company**

  

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent on the date hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") referencing
the appropriate Section or subsection of this Article III or otherwise
readily apparent as responsive to any other Section of this Article III, and
(ii) as set forth or described in any Designated SEC Report, the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

3.1 _ Organization and Qualification._ The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (to the extent the "good
standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside of
the United States), except in the case of any Subsidiary for such failures
that have not had and are not reasonably likely to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has the corporate power and authority to own and operate its
business as presently conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other entity to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction (to the extent the "good standing"
concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States) where the character of its properties owned or held under Lease or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
such failures of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that have not had
and are not reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent true
and correct copies of its Restated Articles of Organization and By-Laws and
the charter documents and by-laws or other organizational documents of each
of its Subsidiaries, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its articles of
organization, certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other applicable
constituent documents, except for such violations that have not had and are
not reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

3.2 _ Authorization; Validity and Effect of Agreement._

  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Required Company Vote with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for obtaining the Required Company Vote, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. Assuming the representations of Parent and Merger Sub contained in
Section 4.7 hereof are accurate, the Required Company Vote is the only vote
of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity (the _"_ Bankruptcy and Equity Exception _")._

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present, the
Company Board duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring that
this Agreement is advisable, (ii) determining that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are in the best interests of the
Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, (iii) approving this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger and the Tender and Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including that the Offer and the Merger and
the

        

Tender and Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby are
not and will not be subject to the provisions of, or any restrictions under,
the provisions of Chapter 110D or Chapter 110F of the Massachusetts Law, and
(iv) resolving to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock accept
the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant
to the Offer and approve this Agreement in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the MBCA (such recommendation, the ___"_ Company Board
Recommendation _")._

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.0025 per share, and (ii)
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which

and Company Options, there are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness or other securities of the Company or any Subsidiary
having the right to vote (or convertible into, exercisable, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote, including the Merger. As of the date
hereof, except for Company Options outstanding on the date hereof under the
Company Stock Plans, there are no existing options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions, convertible securities or other securities, agreements,
commitments, or obligations which would require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold shares of common stock, preferred stock or any other equity securities,
or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
common stock, preferred stock or any other equity securities of the Company

of each holder of Company Options, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to Company Options, the dates of grant and (to the extent
applicable) the exercise prices thereof. The Company is not obligated to
purchase or redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or
the capital stock of any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(c) There are no stockholders agreements, voting trusts or other agreements
or understandings to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound
relating to the voting or registration of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any preemptive rights with respect thereto. As of the date hereof,
the record and, to the knowledge of the Company, beneficial ownership of and
voting power in respect of, the capital stock of the Company with respect to
the signatories to the Tender and Voting Agreements set forth in the Tender
and Voting Agreements, is accurate in all material respects.

  

(d) Other than exceptions that have not had and are not reasonably likely to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, with respect to the Company Options, (i) each

        

Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code so qualifies, (ii) each grant of a Company Option was
duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company
Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all
necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Company
Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof), or a duly
authorized delegate thereof, and any required stockholder approval by
the necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award

properly accounted for in all material respects in accordance with GAAP in
the financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company and
disclosed in the Company SEC Reports in accordance with the Exchange Act and
all other Applicable Laws. The Company has an option grant policy that has
been in effect since October 24, 2006, and the Company has complied in all
material respects with such policy since its adoption.

  

3.4 _ Subsidiaries._

  

(a) Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each
Subsidiary of the Company as of the date of this Agreement. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock and other ownership interests of each of
the Companys Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and
free of preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights. The
Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock and other ownership interests or securities of each of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any claim, lien, pledge, option, right of
first refusal or offer, preemptive right, charge, security interest,
mortgage, right-of-way, covenant, restriction, encumbrance or other rights of

stock or ownership interests.

investment policies) which policies are included in Section 3.4(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, nor the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger, and the Tender and Voting Agreement as
contemplated hereby, will:

  

(i) violate or conflict with the Companys Restated Articles of Organization
or By-Laws;

  

(ii) assuming, with respect to consummation of the Merger, receipt of the
Required Company Vote and assuming satisfaction of the requirements set forth

any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets; or

  

(iii) violate, breach, be in conflict with or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, or permit the termination of any provision of, or result in
the termination of, the acceleration of the maturity of, or the acceleration
of the

        

performance of any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance other than
a Permitted Encumbrance upon any properties, assets or business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Contract, Lease, Permit or
Judgment to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets or properties is bound or encumbered, or give any Person the right to
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to purchase or repurchase any

except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such violations, breaches,

repurchase obligations or other occurrences which have not had and are not
reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect on the ability of
the parties to consummate the Offer and the Merger.

  

(b) Except for the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ ") and as required under any
applicable foreign Regulatory Law, state securities or "blue sky" laws
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, rules and regulations of
NASDAQ, the filing of the Articles of Merger pursuant to the MBCA, the
matters set forth in Section 3.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (which
schedule identifies the nature of each requirement listed thereon), and
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, no consent, approval or
authorization of, Permit from, notice to, or declaration, filing or
registration with, any Governmental Authority is required to be made or
obtained by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except
where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization, Permit or
declaration, to deliver such notice or to make such filing or registration
has not had and is not reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

3.6 _ SEC Reports; Sarbanes-Oxley Act._

  

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC and made available to Parent true and
complete copies of each registration statement, prospectus, proxy or
information statement, form, report and other document, together with any
amendments thereto, required to be filed by it with the SEC under Applicable
Law since January 1, 2004 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). Each
of the Company SEC Reports complied, as of their respective filing dates (or,
if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on
the date of such amended or superseded filing), as to form, in all material
respects with the then applicable requirements of Applicable Law, including
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
" _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). As of its filing date (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of
such amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC Report did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file periodic
reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

received by the Company from the SEC since January 1, 2004 relating to the
Company SEC Reports, together with all written responses of the Company

letters received by the Company from the SEC. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Reports
is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.

        

3.7 _ Financial Statements; Internal Controls._

  

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Reports (i) comply as to form, as of their respective filing dates with the
SEC, in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such
financial statements or, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and
(iii) fairly present (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).

  

(b) The Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting is
reasonably sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable
assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures are executed in accordance with the authorization
of management, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
would materially affect the Companys financial statements. No "significant
deficiency" or "material weakness" was identified in managements assessment
of internal controls as of December 31, 2006 (nor has any such deficiency or
weakness since been identified).

  

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective to provide
reasonable assurance that (i) all material information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

  

(d) Since December 31, 2006, neither the chief executive officer nor the
chief financial officer of the Company has become aware of any fact,
circumstance or change that is reasonably likely to result in a "significant
deficiency" or a "material weakness" in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting.

  

(e) The audit committee of the Company Board includes an Audit Committee
Financial Expert, as defined by Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.

  

(f) The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of
Regulation S-K, for senior financial officers, applicable to its principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer
and controller, or persons performing similar functions. The Company has
promptly disclosed any change in or waiver of the Companys code of ethics
with respect to any such persons, as required by Section 406(b) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no
violations of provisions of the Companys code of ethics by any such persons.

3.8 _ Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement; Offer Documents._

  

(a) The Schedule 14D-9, when filed with the SEC, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and, on the date first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their officers, directors,
representatives, agents or employees in writing expressly for inclusion or

compensation, vacation, group or individual health, dental, medical, life
insurance, survivor benefit, and all other employee benefit plans,
agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements relating to employment,
benefits or entitlements, whether oral or written, formal or informal,
whether or not subject to ERISA, in each case, under which (x) any current or

any governmental advisory opinions, rulings, compliance statements, closing

(c) Each Company Plan has been established and administered in accordance
with its terms, and in material compliance with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and other Applicable Laws. Each Company Plan that is intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualification and
nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, which would
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification or which
requires or could require action under the compliance resolution programs of
the IRS to preserve such qualification. No event has occurred and no
condition exists which would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
either directly or by reason of its affiliation with any of its " _ERISA
Affiliates_ " (defined as any entity treated as a single employer with the
Company under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code), to any material

recent Form 5500 since the date thereof. With respect to any Company Plan, as

routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or threatened
concerning any Company Plan or any service provider or fiduciary thereof, (y)
to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims and
(z) no administrative Proceeding by the Department of Labor, the IRS or
other Governmental Authorities are pending, threatened or in progress.
Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party,
has engaged in a "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined under
Section 4975 of the Code or ERISA Section 406, which would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or Parent to any material Taxes, penalties or
other liabilities under Section 4975 of the Code or ERISA Sections 409
or 502(i).

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any announced plan or legally binding
commitment to create any additional plans, policies, arrangements that would
be Company Plans if in existence on the date of this Agreement or to amend or
modify any existing Company Plan, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has undertaken to maintain any Company Plan
for any period of time and each such Company Plan is terminable at the sole
discretion of the sponsor thereof, subject only to such constraints as may be
imposed by Applicable Law, and (iii) no Company Plan provides for medical or
health benefits (through insurance or otherwise), or provides for the
continuation of such benefits or coverage for any participant, or any
dependent or beneficiary of any participant after such participants
retirement or other termination of employment, except as may be required by
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or
applicable state insurance laws.

  

(e) No Company Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone
or in connection with any subsequent event(s)), will require (i) the payment
to any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates of any material money or
other property, or (ii) the provision of any material benefits or other
rights to any such employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates or (iii) the increase, acceleration
or provision of any material payments, benefits or other material rights to
any such employee, officer, director or consultant, whether or not any such
payment, right or benefit would constitute a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  

(f) (i) No "accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined in ERISA
Section 302 and Section 412 of the Code (whether or not waived) has occurred
with respect to any Company Plans, where any such material liability remains
outstanding; (ii) no event or condition exists which could either be deemed a
"reportable event" within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043 or which presents
a material risk of termination by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("
_PBGC_ "); and (iii) no liability to the PBGC has been incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates (other than insurance
premiums satisfied in due course). With respect to each Company Plan for
which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained,
full payment has been made of all amounts required of the Company under the
terms of each such Company Plan or Applicable Law, as applied through the
Closing Date. The current value of the assets of each such Company Plan, as
of the end of the most recently ended plan year of that Company Plan, equals
or exceeded the current value of all benefits liabilities under that Company
Plan.

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
contributed to, or withdrawn in a partial or complete withdrawal from, or has
or had any liability or obligation in respect of any "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in ERISA Section 3(37). No Company Plan is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" as described in ERISA Section 3(40) or a "multiple
employer plan" as described in ERISA Section 210(a) or Section 413(c) of the
Code.

        

(h) No Company Plan is a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance
program which covers, or otherwise provides for "personal loans" to,
executive officers.

  

(i) No Company Plan is subject to any laws of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States. To the Companys knowledge, no communication, report or
disclosure has been made which, at the time made, did not accurately reflect
the terms and operations of any Company Plan in all material respects.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any
material liability, including under any Company Plan, arising out of the
treatment of any service provider as a consultant or independent contractor
and not as an employee.

  

3.16 _ Labor Relations._ Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union
contract applicable to persons employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Except for any event which has not had and is not reasonably likely to result
in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (a)
there is no labor strike, slowdown or work stoppage or lockout pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (b) there is no unfair labor practice charge or other
employment related complaint pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (c)
there is no representation claim or petition pending before the National
Labor Relations Board.

  

3.17 _ Intellectual Property; Computer Software._

all Intellectual Property Rights necessary for the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted or as formerly
conducted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to sublicense any or
all such rights to third parties, including the right to grant further
sublicenses to customers with respect to the sale, distribution or licensing
of the Companys Software Products (the " _Necessary IP Rights_ "). The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
alter, restrict, encumber, impair or extinguish any Necessary IP Rights.

  

(b) There are no Proceedings pending or threatened (i) alleging infringement,
misappropriation or any other violation of any Intellectual Property Rights
of any Person by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective products or services, except as set forth on Section3.17(b)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, or (ii) challenging the scope, ownership,
validity, or enforceability of the Company IP or of the Company and its
Subsidiaries rights under the Necessary IP Rights. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated
any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person. As of the date of this
Agreement, no claims to the effect that the use, reproduction, modification,
manufacture, distribution, licensing, sublicensing, or sale, or any other
exercise of rights in any Company IP by the Company and its Subsidiaries or
by any licensee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including by the
sale, marketing, distribution or provision of the Company Software Products,
infringes or will infringe on any intellectual or other proprietary or
personal right of any Person have been asserted against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, are threatened by any
Person.

complete list of all Registered IP. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
taken all actions necessary to maintain and protect

        

the Registered IP, including payment of applicable maintenance fees, filing
of applicable statements of use, timely response to any office actions and
disclosure of all required information, and all assignments (and licenses
where required) of the Registered IP have been duly recorded with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities. None of the Registered IP has been
adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole or part and all Registered IP is
valid and enforceable. The Company has no knowledge either of any prior art
references that have not been properly disclosed or any prior public uses,
sales, offers for sale or disclosures that would reasonably be expected to
invalidate the Registered IP or any claim thereof, or of any conduct the
result of which would reasonably be expected to render the Registered IP or
any claim thereof invalid or unenforceable. The original, first and joint
inventors of the subject matter claimed in the patents included in the
Registered IP are properly represented in the Registered IP. There are no
legal or governmental proceedings of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is aware, including interference, re-examination, reissue,
opposition, nullity, or cancellation proceedings, pending that relate to any
of the Registered IP that is owned by the Company or a Subsidiary, other than
review of pending patent and trademark applications, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no such proceedings are, as of the date of this Agreement,
threatened or contemplated by any Governmental Agency or any other Person.

  

(e) Section 3.17(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of all licenses and other Contracts pursuant to which the

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the development or support of
any Company Software Product or (z) used or held for use by the Company for
any other purpose (excluding, for purposes of clauses (y) and (z) only, any
generally available, off-the-shelf software programs licensed by the Company
on standard terms) and (B) a summary of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
remaining payment and accounting obligations, if any, with respect to each of
the Contracts listed thereon, excluding agreements for generally available,
off-the-shelf software programs licensed by the Company on standard terms.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and have not
breached, violated or defaulted under, or received notice that they have
breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any
license, sublicense or other agreement relating to third party Intellectual
Property Rights, nor does the Company have knowledge of any event or
occurrence that would reasonably be expected to constitute such a breach,
violation or default (without or without the lapse of time, giving of notice
or both). Section 3.17(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
true and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of (A) all
agreements pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
provided source code of any Company Software Product or any material part
thereof to a third party and (B) all third parties to whom the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has granted a contingent right to receive the source code
of any Company Software Product or any material part thereof, whether

not made any of their trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary
information that they intended to maintain as confidential (including source
code with respect to Company Software Products) available to any other Person
except pursuant to written agreements requiring such Person to maintain the
confidentiality of such information or materials. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any agreement which confers upon any Person other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries any ownership right or granted an exclusive license with respect
to any

        

Company IP or Intellectual Property Rights developed in connection with such
agreements or the right to modify Company IP or otherwise create derivative
works thereof.

  

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained from all parties
(including current or former directors, officers, consultants or employees)
who have created on behalf of the Company any portion of, or otherwise who
would have any rights in or to, any Company IP or Company Software Product
valid and enforceable written assignments of any such rights to the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the Company has provided true and complete copies of
such assignments to Parent. Excluding the licenses and contracts listed in
Section 3.17(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to provide any consideration (whether

Product.

subject to the provisions of any license to software that is made generally
available to the public without requiring payment of fees or royalties
(including without limitation any obligation or condition under any "open
source" license such as, without limitation, the GNU General Public License,
GNU Lesser General Public License, Mozilla Public License or BSD licenses)
(collectively, " _Publicly Available Software_ "). All Publicly
Available Software used by the Company or any Subsidiary has been used in its
entirety and without modification. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has incorporated or otherwise used Publicly Available Software in a manner
that would require, or condition the use or distribution of any Company
Software Product on the disclosure, licensing or distribution of any source
code for any portion of such Company Software Product.

  

(j) The Company Software Products do not contain any computer code designed
to disrupt, disable, harm, distort or otherwise impede in any manner the
legitimate operation of such software by or for the Company, its Subsidiaries
or its authorized users, or any other associated software, firmware,
hardware, computer system or network (including what are sometimes referred
to as "viruses", "worms", "time bombs" and/or "back doors").

or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Company IP to any other
Person.

  

(l) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Authority were
used, directly or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any
Company IP or any Company Software Product. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is or has ever been a member or promoter of, or a contributor to,
any industry standards body or similar organization that could compel the
Company or such Subsidiary to grant or offer to any other Person any license
or right to such Company IP.

  

(m) The IT Assets operate and perform in all material respects in a manner
that permits the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its business
as currently conducted and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date

of the Lease and each amendment thereto. The Company has heretofore made

and own valid leasehold estates in the Leased Real Property, free and clear
of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances except for such
failures to own valid leaseholds that have not had and are not reasonably
likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Section 3.21(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains
a complete and accurate list of all of the existing Leases granting to any
Person, other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any right to use

officers liability and other casualty and liability insurance, that are in a
form and amount that is customarily carried by persons conducting business
similar to that of the Company and which the Company believes is adequate for
the operation of its business. All such insurance policies are in full force
and effect, no written notice of cancellation has been received by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement under such policies, and there is no
existing default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default, by any insured thereunder, except for
such defaults that have not had and are not reasonably likely to result in,

interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be a

foreign corporation or other entity to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction (to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in
the case of any jurisdiction outside of the United States) where the
character of its properties owned or held under Lease or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures of
Parent to be so qualified as has not had and is not reasonably likely to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has previously made available to the
Company, true and correct copies of its organizational documents and By-Laws,

part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize or approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception.

not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of the Articles of
Incorporation, as amended, or Articles of Organization, respectively or By-
laws of Merger Sub or Parent, (ii) violate, conflict with, or result in the
breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or result in the termination of,

termination or acceleration of maturity under, any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any Lease, Contract or obligation to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party or by which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in Section 4.3(b) hereof, violate or conflict with any Applicable Law or

declaration, filing or registration with any Governmental Authority is

by any federal or state securities laws, including compliance with any

applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Regulatory
Law and (iv) such other consents, except where the failure to obtain such

to the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company;

  

(h) make any change with respect to accounting policies, except as required
by changes in GAAP or by Applicable Law, or except as the Company, based upon
the advice of its independent auditors, and after consultation with Parent,
determines in good faith is advisable to conform to best accounting
practices;

  

(i) except as required by Applicable Law, (x) make any material Tax election

the date of this Agreement or adopt any material method therefor that is
inconsistent with elections made, positions taken or methods used in
preparing or filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods or (y) settle or
resolve any material Tax controversy;

  

(j) enter into any material line of business in any geographic area other
than the current businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
geographic areas where they are conducted, as of the date of this Agreement;

  

(k) other than investments in marketable securities in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices, make any loans, advances or capital

settlements, that would be reasonably likely to have an adverse impact on the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or

  

(n) enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

  

5.2 _ Access to Information._

  

(a) During the Pre-Appointment Period, upon reasonable notice, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, and in a
manner that does not materially disrupt or interfere with the business
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to all its officers,
employees, properties and offices and to all books and records and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent and its Representatives, consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that
the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that, in the
Companys reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such access, (ii) any Applicable Law requires the Company or its
Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties or information or (iii)
providing such access would result in the Company waiving or otherwise losing
any privilege with respect to any such information

        

or if such information constitutes attorney work product. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives in all reasonable respects (including by providing reasonable
access to the Companys and its Subsidiaries records, personnel, and
customers) in connection with, and shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent and its Representatives or, at Parents option and
expense, an independent third party consultant in their efforts following the
date of this Agreement to, verify information regarding its customers,
including, if requested by Parent and to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, by requesting confirmation of such information and statements from such
customers, _provided, that_ the Company shall have the right to participate
jointly in any communications by Parent or its Representatives with customers
except to the extent it may otherwise agree in writing.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon becoming aware of and, with respect to Sections 5.2(b)(i), (ii), (iii),
(v) and (vi), Parent shall promptly notify the Company upon becoming aware
of:

  

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(iii) any Proceeding commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that,
if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have
been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.11 or Section 4.6, as applicable, or
that relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

  

(iv) except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law, any notice or other
written communication from any party to any Material Contract to the effect
that such party is terminating or otherwise materially adversely modifying
its relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

  

(v) any inaccuracy in any material respect of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof; and

  

(vi) any failure of the Company, or the Parent or the Merger Sub, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

  

(c) Parent shall hold such information in confidence to the extent required
by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
dated July 30, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Any investigation
by the Company or Parent shall not affect the representations and warranties
or the conditions to the obligations of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be.

5.3 _ Certain Regulatory Matters and Consents._

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) as soon as practicable
after the date hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Regulatory Law
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable and, with respect to the
Company, not later than ten (10) days following the date on which Parent
makes its filing pursuant to such Act, any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any
applicable foreign Regulatory Law and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Regulatory Law as soon as practicable.
In addition and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all
Permits of NASDAQ, and all other Governmental Authorities required for
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to conduct the business after
the Closing Date as are conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof (and not violate any Applicable Laws or regulations by reason
of the consummation of the Offer and the Merger), including each of the
Permits identified in _Section 3.5(b) _of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 5.3(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any Proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly
inform the other party of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any Proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC
or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and
foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other antitrust, competition or
merger control laws or laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants
of the parties contained in Section 5.3(a) and this Section 5.3(b), each
party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Regulatory Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including but not
limited to the parties obligations under Section 5.3(a) to use commercially
reasonable best efforts), in connection with any filing or submission
required or action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate
the Merger, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to
enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any
operational restriction, or take or commit to take any action that, in
the sole discretion of Parent, would be expected to limit (x) the freedom
of action of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the

        

operation of, or Parents or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates ability to
retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, or (y) the ability to retain, own or operate any material portion of
the businesses, product lines, or assets, of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or
commercial practices of the Company, Parent or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

  

(c) In furtherance and not limitation of the foregoing, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall each use commercially reasonable best efforts to: (i)
cause the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex C_ hereto and the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI hereof to be satisfied or
fulfilled, (ii) obtain consents of all third parties necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Offer and the Merger) and (iii) provide any notices to third parties
required to be provided prior to the Appointment Time, including under any
Leases or insurance policies so as to maintain and preserve the benefits
under such Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) without any
requirement that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incur any cost or
obligation to suffer the loss of any right in connection therewith.

  

(d) Each of the parties shall execute any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties agree to use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur as soon as
practicable after the receipt of the Required Company Vote with respect to
the Merger. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary action.

  

5.4 _ Acquisition Proposals._

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.4, at all times during the
Pre-Appointment Period, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit
any of their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) conduct or engage in any discussions,
investigations or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any third party that has informed the Company that it is
seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or take any
other action intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes or could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
(y) approve any transaction under or any third party becoming an "interested
stockholder" under Chapter 110F of the Massachusetts Laws or (z) amend or
grant any waiver or release or make any determination under or approve any
transaction or redeem any Company Rights under the Rights Agreement or take
any action under the Rights Agreement to facilitate an Acquisition Proposal
except in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any
Acquisition Proposal other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
Section 5.4(b). Except as the Company Board determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties, the Company Board shall not fail to make, nor shall
it withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (or in
either case recommend to the Company Stockholders an Acquisition Proposal or
make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation)
or resolve to take any of the foregoing actions (it being agreed that any
notice to Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i)(x) shall not constitute any
such resolution) (any of the foregoing a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ", which will not include a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with
any third

        

party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause any
such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished
by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to such third party in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal within 12 months prior to the date of
this Agreement promptly to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all
such information.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, at all times
during the Pre-Appointment Period, the Company Board may, directly or through
the Companys Representatives: (i) engage or participate in negotiations or
discussions with any third party (and its Representatives) that, subject to
the Companys compliance with Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(c), has made a _bona
fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, is or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to any such third party (and its
Representatives) non-public information relating to, and provide access to,
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses,
properties, assets, books and records pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Section 5.4(b)
(a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (but in no event
later than one (1) Business Day) provided for informational purposes only to
Parent), and/or (iii) take any action that any court of competent
jurisdiction orders the Company to take, but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i)-(ii), only if the Company Board determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so
long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with
this Section 5.4.

  

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i)-(ii) of Section 5.4(b) or make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written
notice advising that the Company intends to take such action. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after an
officer or director of the Company first obtains knowledge of the receipt by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
of an Acquisition Proposal) after receipt by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the non-public business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any third party that is seeking to make an
Acquisition Proposal or any other indication that a third party is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such
notice orally and in writing to Parent and shall identify the third party
making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
prompt basis, of the status and material details of any discussions or
negotiations relating to such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request,
including the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto and
material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material
terms thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior
notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is
provided to the members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent with: (i) any information concerning the Companys
business, present or future performance, financial condition or results of
operations provided to any third party pursuant to Section 5.4(b) that was
not previously provided to Parent and (ii) copies of all material documents
and material written communications relating to such Acquisition

        

Proposal exchanged between the Company, any of its respective Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the third party
making such Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the
other hand.

  

5.5 _ Company Stockholders Meeting; Short-Form Merger._

  

(a) If approval of the stockholders of the Company is required under
Massachusetts Law or the rules of NASDAQ in order to consummate the Merger,
the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of (or, at the request of Parent, action by written
consent by) the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Stockholders 
Meeting_", which term shall, without limitation, include stockholder action
by written consent) as promptly as practicable following the Appointment Time
for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement in accordance
with Massachusetts Law or the rules of NASDAQ. Nothing herein shall prevent
the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting
if there are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to
conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall,
unless otherwise requested by Parent, solicit from the Company Stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement in accordance with
Massachusetts Law, and shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
secure the Required Company Vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless
this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VII hereof, the
Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement in accordance with Massachusetts Law, whether or
not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine
that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company
Stockholders reject it. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) shall not be limited to, or
otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all shares of Parent-Owned Stock
as of the applicable record date in favor of the approval of this Agreement
in accordance with Massachusetts Law at the Company Stockholders Meeting or
otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Merger Sub
beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of
the stockholders of Merger Sub, in favor of the approval of this Agreement in
accordance with Massachusetts Law.

  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4 hereof or this Section 5.5,
in the event that Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, shall
acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 11.05 of the MBCA.

  

5.6 _ Proxy Statement._

  

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required by Massachusetts Law
in order to consummate the Merger, as soon as practicable following the
Appointment Time, the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare, and the
Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement for use in connection
with the solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders in connection
with the Merger and the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company and
Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the
Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to
the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence with the SEC or its staff with

        

respect to, the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The
Company shall promptly advise Parent after it receives notice of any request
by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement,
or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its
staff for additional information in connection therewith. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Company and Parent shall cause
the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and any
applicable rules of the NASDAQ.

  

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VII
hereof, and subject to the terms of Section 5.4(a) hereof, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than
with respect to the Offer).

  

5.7 _ Employee Benefits Matters._

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide to then current employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") with, at Parents election, either
(i) employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those benefits provided to such employees under the Company Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than benefits under benefit plans that
provide for the grant or issuance of equity securities or equity-based
awards) or (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than benefits under benefit plans that
provide for the grant or issuance of equity securities or equity-based
awards).

  

(b) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to: (i) use commercially reasonable best efforts to
ensure that all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Company Employees under any welfare plan that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time be
waived by the applicable provider; (ii) each Company Employee receives credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time during
the applicable plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time in such year for the applicable provider; and (iii) each
Company Employee is provided with credit for service with the Company and its
Affiliates (x) for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting (but
excluding benefit accrual) under any plans and (y) for all purposes under
each other employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of Parent or its
Affiliates, in each case in which such employees become eligible to
participate, to the extent such service was credited for similar purposes
under similar plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

   

39  

   

(c) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Company will terminate
any and all Company Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred
arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code and effective immediately prior
to the Closing, no Company Employee shall have any right to contribute any
amounts to any Company Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code. At the request of
Parent, the Company will provide Parent with evidence that such Company Plans
have been terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to
resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board. In addition, at the request of
Parent, the Company will terminate any and all other Company Plans, including
any group health, dental, severance, separation or salary continuation plans,
programs or arrangements, effective either immediately prior to the Closing
or thereafter as specified by Parent and, at the request of Parent, the
Company will provide Parent with evidence that such Company Plans have been
so terminated pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board. The
Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
Company Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

  

5.8 _ Fees and Expenses._ Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and Parent shall share equally all filing fees payable pursuant
to Regulatory Law.

  

5.9 _ Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

  

(a) Any indemnification and exculpation provisions of the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and By-laws or similar
organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at or prior to the Closing were directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding
pending or asserted within such period shall continue until the disposition
or resolution of such Proceeding. From and after the Closing, Parent will
assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand
surety for, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
5.9, without limit as to time.

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing) each present and former director,
officer or employee of the Company and each Person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(collectively, " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any Proceeding), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
before the Closing (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company) or the
Merger. In the event of any such Proceeding, Buyer and the Company shall
cooperate with such Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Proceeding.

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent will cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") maintained for the benefit of
the Company, its current and former directors and officers (or third-party
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are in other respects not materially less advantageous to the
Indemnified Persons, and which coverage and amounts shall be no less than the
coverage and amounts provided at that time for Parents directors and
officers) with respect to matters arising on or before the Closing;
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof (the

        

amount of which premium is set forth in Section 5.9(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount.

  

(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of
the Indemnified Persons. Parent will pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

  

5.10 _ Public Announcements._ Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or

Time._ Notwithstanding the prior approval of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Massachusetts Law, if required, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and/or the Merger may be abandoned,
at any time prior to the Effective Time (it being agreed that the party
hereto terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall give
prompt written notice of such termination to the other party or parties

competent jurisdiction shall have (a) enacted, issued, promulgated, entered,
enforced or deemed applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby

7.3 _ Effect of Termination._

  

(a) Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1 or 7.2 hereof
shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as
provided in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall thereafter be no liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers or directors
hereunder except with respect to Section 5.2(c), Section 5.8, Section 5.10,
Section 5.16, this Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, _provided, that_ the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any intentional
breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in, or fraud in connection
with, or knowing breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement
occurring prior to termination. In addition to the foregoing, no termination
of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

  

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) a fee in the amount of $10,179,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
") if:

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i),
Section 7.1(c)(ii), Section 7.1(c)(iii) or Section 7.1(c)(iv) or by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), with such fee to be paid under this
Section 7.3(b)(i) concurrently with any termination by the Company and within
two (2) Business Days following any termination by Parent, or

        

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(v) or Section
7.1(c)(vi) and (x) prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made and (y) within 12 months following the date of such
termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, recommended to its shareholders, or consummated, an Acquisition
Proposal, with such fee to be paid under this Section 7.3(b)(ii) within two
(2) Business Days of entering into such definitive agreement, making such
recommendation, or consummating such transaction. For purposes of this Section
7.3(b), the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the same meaning as
the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " set forth in _Annex A_ , except that (i)
all references to fifteen percent (15%) shall be deemed to be "a majority"
for purposes of the definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " and (ii) the
reference to eighty-five percent (85%) therein shall be deemed "a majority"
for purposes of this definition of an "Acquisition Proposal".

  

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), and that, without these agreements,
Parent would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay
promptly the fee due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company will also pay
to Parent Parents reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any successful action, including the filing of
any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with
interest on the amount of the unpaid fee under this Section 7.3, accruing
from its due date, at an interest rate per annum equal to two percentage
points in excess of the prime commercial lending rate quoted by Citibank,
N.A. Any change in the interest rate hereunder resulting from a change in
such prime rate will be effective at the beginning of the date of such change
in such prime rate. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this
Section 7.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach
of this Agreement described in Section 7.3(a), but otherwise shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with
any termination of this Agreement.

  

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement
(including Section 1.3(c) hereof), this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto (or successors thereto), by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
the Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which
by law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto (or successors
thereto).

  

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
or parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise
set forth herein, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party or parties hereto, as
applicable, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party or parties hereto contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained for the benefit of such party or parties
hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable.
Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver of such right.
