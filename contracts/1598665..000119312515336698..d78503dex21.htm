information reasonably requested by the Seller&#146;s Representative used by the Acquired Companies in calculating the Proposed Closing Date Financial Statements and the Proposed Purchase Price. The Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to comply
with such request within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the Seller&#146;s Representative&#146;s request. The Proposed Purchase Price shall be deemed final and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer for all purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent
that the Sellers&#146; Representative delivers a written objection notice to the Buyer (the &#147;<U>Seller&#146;s Objection Notice</U>&#148;) within seventy-five (75)&nbsp;days after the date the Sellers&#146; Representative receives the Proposed
Closing Date Financial Statements. Seller&#146;s Objection Notice shall set forth an explanation of each item to which the Sellers&#146; Representative takes exception, specifies in reasonable detail the nature and extent of each exception and
provides the Sellers&#146; Representative&#146;s calculation of the final Purchase Price as proposed by the Sellers&#146; Representative. If the Buyer disputes the Sellers&#146; Representative&#146;s exceptions, then the Buyer and the Sellers&#146;
Representative will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute and (i)&nbsp;the Sellers&#146; Representative shall make its employees and advisors responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of, the

If requested by the Auditor, the Sellers&#146; Representative and the Buyer agree to execute an engagement letter that is acceptable to the parties acting together in good faith. All fees and expenses relating to the services to be performed by the
Auditor (the &#147;<U>Auditor&#146;s Fees</U>&#148;) shall be borne by the Sellers&#146; Representative and the Buyer in the same proportion as the Auditor&#146;s resolution of the aggregate dollar amount of the Final Purchase Price such that the
party with whom the Auditor more closely agrees pays a lesser portion of the Auditor&#146;s Fees and the other party pays a greater portion. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000), and the Auditor
awards Six Hundred Dollars ($600) in favor of the Sellers&#146; Representative&#146;s position, sixty percent (60%)&nbsp;of the Auditor&#146;s Fees would be borne by the Buyer, and forty percent (40%)&nbsp;of the Auditor&#146;s Fees would be borne
by the Sellers&#146; Representative. The Auditor shall act as an arbitrator by written submission to determine the Final Purchase Price. The Auditor&#146;s determination shall be based solely on the provisions of this Agreement and the presentations
by the Sellers&#146; Representative and the Buyer (or their designated representatives) and not by independent review. If either the Buyer or the Sellers&#146; Representative furnishes a written submission or other material to the Auditor, such
Party will simultaneously furnish a copy to the other Party. In connection with the matters contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.2(b), the both parties shall provide to the Auditor and the other party on a timely basis all books, records and other
information necessary to a determination of the Final Purchase Price and the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Auditor&#146;s determination of the Final Purchase Price shall (i)&nbsp;not be less than the amount

Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to obtain duplicate payment of those recovered amounts from any other Seller or Other Seller Party or Trust Beneficiary. By way of example, if Buyer has a claim for $1 million under Article VIII hereof and
Buyer obtains a judgment against each Seller, Other Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary in the total amount of $1 million, then if Buyer receives payment from MNE Holdings, Inc. for its Pro Rata Share of the $1 million (equal to $58,800), then Buyer

$1 million, provided that the aggregate dollar amount payable by MP Holdings LLC and its direct and indirect owners other than MNE Holdings, Inc., KMK Enterprises LLC, the G. Markus Polivka Trust and G. Markus Polivka in respect of the $1 million
judgment will be reduced to reflect the payment of the $58,800. By way of further example, if Buyer has a claim for $1 million under Article VIII hereof and Buyer obtains a judgment against each Seller, Other Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary in
