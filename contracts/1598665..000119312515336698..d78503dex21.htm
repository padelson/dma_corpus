iv _STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 

This Stock Purchase Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
this 29th day of September, 2015, by and among HERITAGE INSURANCE HOLDINGS,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), ZEPHYR ACQUISITION COMPANY, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), each of RM OCEAN HARBOR HOLDING,
INC., a Delaware corporation and MP HOLDINGS LLC, a Hawaii limited liability
company (each a " _Seller_ " and collectively, the " _Sellers_ "), each of the
OTHER SELLER PARTIES executing a signature page hereto (the " _Other Seller
Parties_ "), each of the RESTRICTIVE COVENANT PARTIES executing a signature
page hereto (the " _Restrictive Covenant Parties_ "), and RM OCEAN HARBOR
HOLDING, INC. in its capacity as a representative of the Sellers (the "
_Sellers  Representative_").

WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in the Business directly or indirectly
through its Subsidiaries; and

WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to acquire 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company, all of which are owned 100% by the
Sellers (the " _Shares_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and obligations set forth
in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

SALE AND PURCHASE OF THE SHARES

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of the Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and on the basis of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, at the Closing, each of
the Sellers shall sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer will purchase from each
Seller, the Shares owned by such Seller, free and clear of any Liens.

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of counsel for the Buyer,
Greenberg Traurig, PA, located at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 2000,
Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301, on the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in Article VII
below, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the
Buyer and the Sellers. The date upon which the Closing occurs is referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date._ "

 

1.3 _Withholding_. Each Party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect
to the making of such payment, provided, however, such Party shall first
notify the Person subject to such withholding of its intent to withhold and
give such Person an opportunity to demonstrate that no withholding (or a
lesser amount) is required. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made. ARTICLE II

 

CONSIDERATION

2.1  _Purchase Price_. As consideration for the Shares, the Buyer shall pay,
or cause to be paid, at the Closing to the Sellers Representative (on behalf
of the Sellers) an aggregate amount equal to One Hundred Twenty Million
Dollars ($120,000,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), which Base Purchase
Price shall be (a) _decreased_ by the amount of any Debt and (b) _increased_
(if a positive number) or _decreased_ (if a negative number) by the Change in
Net Stockholders Equity Amount (the Base Purchase Price as so adjusted is
referred to as the " _Purchase Price_ "). At the Closing, the Buyer will pay,
or cause to be paid, the Purchase Price in the following manner: (A) the
Total Debt Payoff Amount as specified (and in the amounts specified) in the
Funds Flow Memorandum, (B) in the event of a Wind Holdback Event, then the
Wind Holdback Amount shall be retained by the Buyer, (C) deposit the Kingsway
Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent, (D) the Kingsway Holdback Amount shall be
retained by the Buyer, (E) the Transaction Expenses to the appropriate parties
pursuant to the wire instructions attached to the Funds Flow Memorandum, and
(F) the remaining balance of the Purchase Price (as adjusted by the Change in
Net Stockholders Equity Amount) to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers) pursuant to the wire instructions attached to the Funds
Flow Memorandum. No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Sellers Representative shall prepare in good faith and deliver to the Buyer
the estimated Debt, Change in Net Stockholders Equity Amount, Wind Holdback
Amount and Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Amounts_ ") together with
any supporting documents as the Buyer requests. In the event of a disagreement
by the Buyer with the Sellers Representatives calculation of the
Estimated Amounts, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall negotiate
in good faith with a view to resolving such disagreements as promptly as
practicably. The Closing shall not occur until any such disagreement has been
resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative.

2.2 _Determination of the Final Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The Purchase Price has been estimated as provided in and Sections 1.1 and
2.1. The Parties intend that the Purchase Price shall be finalized as
provided in this Section 2.2. The Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers Representative within seventy five (75) days after the Closing Date
(i) the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Proposed
Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") together with any supporting documents as
Sellers Representative may reasonably request and (ii) calculations of (a)
the Proposed Debt, (b) the Proposed Change in Net Stockholders Equity Amount
(all collectively referred to herein as the " _Proposed Closing Date Financial
Statements_ ") and (c) the final Purchase Price as proposed by the Buyer (the
" _Proposed Purchase Price_ "). The Proposed Closing Date Financial
Statements shall be prepared by the Acquired Companies in accordance with GAAP
and in a manner consistent with the GAAP accounting principles set forth on
Schedule 2.2(a); _provided_   _however_ , that the proposed Closing Date
Financial Statements shall not reflect any losses, expenses or reserves
attributable to any Wind Holdback Event to the extent the Buyer is entitled to
recover such losses, expense or reserves from the Wind Holdback Amount. The
Parties shall ensure that the employees of the Acquired Companies responsible
for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of,
the Proposed Closing Date Financial Statements and the calculation of the
Proposed Purchase Price are reasonably available to the Sellers

 



2  Representative for consultation after delivery of the Proposed Closing Date
Financial Statements and the Proposed Purchase Price calculation. Within ten
(10) days after its receipt of the Proposed Closing Date Financial
Statements, the Sellers Representative may request that the Buyer cause the
Acquired Companies to provide or provide access to the Sellers Representative
on a timely basis all books and records and other information reasonably
requested by the Sellers Representative used by the Acquired Companies in
calculating the Proposed Closing Date Financial Statements and the Proposed
Purchase Price. The Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to comply with
such request within ten (10) days after the Sellers Representatives request.
The Proposed Purchase Price shall be deemed final and binding upon the Sellers
and the Buyer for all purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent that
the Sellers Representative delivers a written objection notice to the Buyer
(the " _Seller s Objection Notice_") within seventy-five (75) days after the
date the Sellers Representative receives the Proposed Closing Date Financial
Statements. Sellers Objection Notice shall set forth an explanation of each
item to which the Sellers Representative takes exception, specifies in
reasonable detail the nature and extent of each exception and provides the
Sellers Representatives calculation of the final Purchase Price as proposed
by the Sellers Representative. If the Buyer disputes the Sellers
Representatives exceptions, then the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute and (i) the Sellers
Representative shall make its employees and advisors responsible for and
knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of,
the Sellers Objection Notice reasonably available thereafter to the Buyer
and (ii) Sellers Representative shall provide or provide access to the Buyer
on a timely basis all books and records and other information reasonably
requested by the by the Buyer used in calculating the Sellers Objection
Notice.

(b) If, after thirty (30) days following the date on which the Buyer receives
the Seller Objection Notice, the proposed changes still remain disputed, then
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative will engage the Auditor to determine
the Final Purchase Price and the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet. If
requested by the Auditor, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer agree to
execute an engagement letter that is acceptable to the parties acting together
in good faith. All fees and expenses relating to the services to be performed
by the Auditor (the " _Auditor s Fees_") shall be borne by the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer in the same proportion as the Auditors
resolution of the aggregate dollar amount of the Final Purchase Price such
that the party with whom the Auditor more closely agrees pays a lesser
portion of the Auditors Fees and the other party pays a greater portion. For
example, should the items in dispute total in amount to One Thousand Dollars
($1,000), and the Auditor awards Six Hundred Dollars ($600) in favor of the
Sellers Representatives position, sixty percent (60%) of the Auditors Fees
would be borne by the Buyer, and forty percent (40%) of the Auditors Fees
would be borne by the Sellers Representative. The Auditor shall act as an
arbitrator by written submission to determine the Final Purchase Price. The
Auditors determination shall be based solely on the provisions of this
Agreement and the presentations by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer
(or their designated representatives) and not by independent review. If either
the Buyer or the Sellers Representative furnishes a written submission or
other material to the Auditor, such Party will simultaneously furnish a copy
to the other Party. In connection with the matters contemplated by this
Section 2.2(b), the both parties shall provide to the Auditor and the other
party on a timely basis all books, records and other information necessary to
a determination of the Final Purchase Price and the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet. The Auditors determination of the Final Purchase Price shall (i) not
be less than the amount 

 



3  proposed by the Buyer and not more than the amount proposed by the Sellers
Representative, (ii) be set forth in a written report consisting of a reasoned
analysis and concluding in an award delivered to the Sellers Representative
and the Buyer, (iii) direct the payment of funds in a manner consistent with
such determination and (iv) allocate the Auditors Fees between the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer in a manner consistent with this Section 2.2(b).
The Auditors determination of the Final Purchase Price and the Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws be
deemed final and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer for all purposes of
this Agreement.

(c) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " means (i) the Proposed Purchase Price
proposed by the Buyer if the Sellers Representative does not timely dispute
such Proposed Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.2(a), (ii) the Final
Purchase Price agreed to by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer or
(iii) the Final Purchase Price as determined by the Auditor in accordance with
Section 2.2(b), whichever is applicable. The " _Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet_ " means (i) the Proposed Closing Date Balance Sheet if the Sellers
Representative does not timely dispute such Proposed Closing Date Balance
Sheet in accordance with Section 2.2(a), (ii) the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet agreed to by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer or (iii) the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet as determined by the Auditor in accordance
with Section 2.2(b), whichever is applicable.

 

(d) If the Purchase Price paid at the Closing is greater than the Final
Purchase Price (such difference being the " _Overpayment_ ") then the Sellers
will pay to the Buyer the Overpayment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than ten (10) Business Days following the
determination of the Final Purchase Price.

 

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price paid at the
Closing (such difference being the " _Underpayment_ "), then the Buyer will
pay to the Sellers Representative the Underpayment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days of the determination
of the Final Purchase Price.

 

2.3 _Wind Holdback Event_. (a) In the event a Wind Event occurs prior to
Closing (a " _Wind Holdback Event_ "), then the Buyer shall be entitled to
hold back at Closing from the Purchase Price an amount equal to the retention
amounts under the Existing Reinsurance Contracts (the " _Wind Holdback Amount_
"). The foregoing does not apply with regard to losses under WYO Policies
issued by any Acquired Company; however, if the Buyer, at the time of the Wind
Event, cannot reasonably determine if certain losses incurred during the Wind
Event will ultimately be covered under the WYO Policies or a policy insuring
against the Wind Event then such losses shall be included in the calculation
of the amounts in the Wind Holdback Amount, at the Buyers option. The Buyer
shall be entitled to apply the Wind Holdback Amount first to Wind Holdback
Event losses payable by the Insurance Company Subsidiary under the retention
limits of each Existing Reinsurance Contract and then to Wind Holdback Event
losses payable but not reinsured under such reinsurance agreements.
Twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and
within thirty (30) days thereafter deliver to the Seller a statement as of the
end of such twelve month period, setting forth the paid losses, case reserves
and the reserves for claims incurred but not reported attributable to the
Wind Holdback Event, in either case as determined by the Acquired Companys
Chief Actuary or independent actuary, as applicable (the " _UNL_ ," such
statement being referred to as "the " _UNL Statement_ ").

 



4 (b) Upon the Sellers Representatives request, the Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companys Chief Actuary or independent actuary, as applicable, to
provide to the Sellers Representative on a timely basis all books and records
and other information reasonably requested by Sellers Representative used in
calculating the UNL. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, the
UNL shall be deemed final and binding upon the Seller and the Buyer for all
purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent that the Sellers
Representative delivers a written objection notice to the Buyer (the "
_Seller s UNL Notice_") within forty-five (45) days after the date the
Sellers Representative receives the UNL Statement; or, if later, within
thirty (30) days after the Sellers Representative receives the books and
records and other information reasonably requested by Sellers Representative
used in calculating the UNL. The Sellers UNL Notice shall set forth an
explanation of each item to which the Sellers Representative takes
exception, specifies in reasonable detail the nature and extent of each
exception and provides the Sellers Representatives calculation of the UNL as
proposed by the Sellers Representative. If the Buyer disputes the Sellers
Representatives exceptions, then the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute and (i) the Sellers
Representative shall make its employees and advisors responsible for and
knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of, the
Sellers Representatives UNL Notice reasonably available thereafter to the
Buyer, the (ii) Sellers Representative shall make available the books and
records reasonably requested by the Buyer used in calculating the Sellers
Representatives proposed UNL and (iii) the Buyer shall make its Chief Actuary
or independent actuary, as the case may be, reasonably available to the
Sellers Representative and its advisors.

(c) If, forty-five (45) days following the date on which the Buyer receives
the Sellers Representatives UNL Notice, the UNL still remains disputed, then
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative will engage Leslie Marlow of Madison
Consulting or another mutually agreeable independent Actuary (the " _Actuary_
") to determine the UNL. If requested by the Actuary, the Seller and the Buyer
agree to execute an engagement letter that is acceptable to the parties acting
together in good faith. All fees and expenses relating to the services to be
performed by the Actuary (the "Actuarys Fees") shall be borne by the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer in the same proportion as the Actuarys
resolution of the aggregate dollar amount of the UNL such that the party with
whom the Actuary more closely agrees pays a lesser portion of the Actuarys
Fees and the other party pays a greater portion. For example, should the items
in dispute total in amount to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000), and the Actuary
awards Six Hundred Dollars ($600) in favor of the Sellers Representatives
position, sixty percent (60%) of the Actuarys Fees would be borne by the
Buyer, and forty percent (40%) of the Actuarys Fees would be borne by the
Sellers Representative. The Actuary shall act as an arbitrator by written
submission to determine the Final Purchase Price. The Actuarys determination
shall be based upon independent review of the presentations and information
provided by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative. If either the Buyer or
the Sellers Representative furnishes a written submission or other material
to the Actuary, such Party will simultaneously furnish a copy to the other
Party. In connection with the matters contemplated by this Section 2.3(c) both
Parties shall provide to the Actuary and the other Party on a timely basis all
books, records and other information necessary to a determination of the
UNL. The Actuarys determination of the UNL shall (i) not be more than the
amount proposed by the Buyer and not less than the amount proposed by the
Sellers Representative, (ii) be set forth in a written report consisting of
a reasoned analysis and concluding in an award delivered to the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer, and (iii) direct the payment of funds in a
manner consistent with such determination. The Actuarys determination of the
UNL shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws be deemed final
and binding upon the Sellers Representative and the Buyer.

(d) The " _Final UNL_ " means (i) the UNL proposed by the Buyer if the Seller
does not timely dispute such UNL in accordance with Section 2.3(c), (ii) the
UNL agreed to by the Seller and the Buyer or (iii) the UNL as determined by
the Actuary in accordance with Section 2.2(b), whichever is applicable. The "
_Wind Holdback Balance_ " means (i) the amount of the Wind Holdback Amount,
less (ii) the Final UNL. The Buyer will pay to the Seller the Wind Holdback
Balance, if any, without interest, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the Final UNL.

 



5 2.4 _Kingsway Dispute_. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit Two Million
Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,400,000) (the " _Kingsway Escrow Amount_ ")
from the Purchase Price into an escrow account with an escrow agent reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held
and disbursed pursuant to that certain Escrow Agreement, dated as of the
Closing Date, by and among the Buyer, the Sellers Representative, and the
Escrow Agent, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A with such
changes as the Escrow Agent shall require (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), for
the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the Sellers for any
Damages arising out of or relating to the Kingsway Dispute. The Escrow
Agreement shall provide, among other things, for the Buyer to be advanced
legal fees and disbursements as provided in Section 8.10(a) of this Agreement,
and to receive funds from the Escrow Agent, in each case without the
requirement of the consent of, but on notice as hereinafter provided to, the
Seller or Sellers Representative for any Damage related to the Kingsway
Dispute. In addition, Buyer shall be entitled to hold back at Closing from the
Purchase Price an amount equal to One Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,200,000) (the " _Kingsway Holdback Amount_ "), for the purpose of securing
the indemnification obligations of the Sellers for any Damages arising out of
or relating to the Kingsway Dispute. The Buyer shall be entitled, on notice
as hereinafter provided to the Sellers Representative, to apply the Kingsway
Holdback Amount to any Damages arising out of or relating to the Kingsway
Dispute. The Buyer must exercise its right so to apply the Kingsway Holdback
Amount in full before making any claim to the Kingsway Escrow Amount. The
Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative ten (10) days prior written
notice prior to any reduction or draw on the Kingsway Holdback Amount or the
Kingsway Escrow Amount specifying the amount of the reduction or draw and
describing the Damages incurred with reasonable particularity. If within three
(3) years after the Closing Date, either (i) the parties to the Kingsway
Dispute have entered into a settlement or other resolution of the Kingsway
Dispute that includes a full and unconditional release of the Acquired
Companies, or (ii) (x) there has not been, and there is not pending or,
threatened, any Litigation relating to the Kingsway Dispute, (y) the parties
to the Kingsway Dispute have not entered into a tolling agreement, as
certified in writing by the Sellers, and (z) all applicable statute of
limitations relating to the Kingsway Dispute have expired, as certified in
writing by the Sellers or their counsel and Buyer does not have a reasonable
basis to believe that any statute of limitations has not expired (either (i)
or (ii) being collectively, the " _Kingsway Dispute Release Conditions_ "),
Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers
Representative any remaining portion of the Kingsway Escrow Amount and Buyer
shall release any remaining portion of the Kingsway Holdback Amount to
Sellers Representative. If any of the Kingsway Dispute Release Conditions are
not satisfied within such three (3) year period, that portion of the Kingsway
Holdback Amount and the 

 



6  Kingsway Escrow Amount which the Buyer in good faith believes is necessary
to satisfy any Damages relating to the Kingsway Dispute shall be retained
until final resolution of such Damages, and shall be paid, as soon as
reasonably practicable after such Damages are resolved to the satisfaction of
the Buyer, to the extent necessary, to satisfy any such Damages, and the
balance shall be paid to the Sellers Representative. The Kingsway Holdback
Amount shall accrue interest at the same rate as the Kingsway Escrow Amount
under the Escrow Agreement and, for purposes of this Agreement, such interest
shall be deemed to be part of the Kingsway Holdback Amount.

3.4 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) _GAAP Financial Statements._ _Section 3.4 of the Companys Disclosure
Schedule_ contains true, correct and complete copies of the (i) unaudited
consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December
31, 2014 (" _Year-End Balance Sheet Date_ ") and unaudited consolidated

and collectively with the Year-End GAAP Financial Statements, the " _GAAP
Financial Statements_ "). The GAAP Financial Statements (i) fairly present
the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations and
changes in shareholders equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates of, and for the periods referred to in, the Financial
Statement, and (ii) were prepared in accordance

 



9  with GAAP, subject, in the case of the Interim GAAP Financial Statements, to
normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material) and, in the case of the
Unaudited GAAP Financial Statements and the Interim GAAP Financial Statements,
the absence of notes. The GAAP Financial Statements reflect the consistent
application of GAAP throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed in
the notes to the Year-End GAAP Financial Statements or in _Section 3.4 of the
Companys Disclosure Schedule_. No financial statements of any Person other
than the Acquired Companies are required by GAAP to be included or reflected
in the GAAP Financial Statements. The GAAP Financial Statements were prepared
from, and are consistent with, the accounting Records of each Acquired
Company. The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and audited consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014,
together with the report of the Companys independent public accountants (the
" _2014 Audited Financial Statements_ ") when delivered will and at Closing
will (i) fairly present the consolidated financial condition and the results
of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of, and for
the periods referred to in, the Financial Statement, (ii) be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and (iii) reflect the consistent application of GAAP
throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed in the notes to the 2014

(b) _Statutory Financial Statements_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
made available to the Buyer true, complete and correct copies of the
quarterly statutory financial statement for the quarterly periods ending March
31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 and the annual statutory financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2010, December 21, 2011, December 31, 2012,
December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, as filed with the insurance
Governmental Authorities of the jurisdictions in which is does business, and
audited statutory financial statements as of the periods ended December 31,
2010, December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013 and December 31,
2014, as filed with its domestic insurance Governmental Authority, together,
in each case, with the applicable exhibits, schedules, interrogatories
(including the property and casualty reinsurance interrogatories), actuarial
opinions, actuarial summaries and notes thereto and any affirmations and
certifications filed therewith (collectively, the " _Statutory Financial
Statements_ "). The Statutory Financial Statements fairly present in all
material respects the financial position and results of operations of the
applicable Acquired Companies as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with then in
effect Statutory Accounting Principles consistently applied. The
representations and warranties in this _Section 3.4(b)_ shall not be deemed
to be breached as a result of any substantive change in Statutory Accounting
Principles, in their interpretations, or Law after the date of this Agreement.
All Statutory Financial Statements required to be filed with or submitted to
the insurance Governmental Authorities in the states in which the Insurance
Company Subsidiary does business have been filed or submitted, as applicable.
The Statutory Financial Statements comply in all material respects, on their
respective dates of filing or submission, with the Laws of their respective
states of domicile and no material deficiency of any nature has been asserted
with respect to such Statutory Financial Statements by any Governmental
Authority which has not been cured, waived or otherwise resolved to the
satisfaction of any such Governmental Authority. None of the Acquired
Companies had, at the relevant balance sheet date of each balance sheet
included in the Statutory Financial Statements, any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether accrued,

 



10  absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with Statutory
Accounting Principles and none have arisen since such date through the date
of this Agreement, except in each case for liabilities or obligations (i)
reflected in the Statutory Financial Statements, (ii) contemplated by or under
this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business, or (iv) incurred
outside the Ordinary Course of Business that individually, in the case of this
subsection (iv) only, do not exceed $100,000, or in the aggregate, in the
case of this subsection (iv) only, do not exceed $250,000. The statutory
balance sheets and income statements have been audited by KMPG LLP and the
Company has made available true and complete copies of auditor
opinions related thereto. The Company has delivered to the Buyer copies of
all letters from the Companys auditors to the Companys Board of Directors or
audit committee thereof relating to the Statutory Financial Statements during
the 36 months prior to the date of this Agreement, together with copies of
all responses thereto.

(c) _Actuarial Information_. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Acquired Companies made available to the Buyer: (i) true, complete, and
correct copies of all loss and loss adjustment expenses, case reserves and
analyses, and deferred acquisition costs relating to the Insurance
Company Subsidiarys insurance business (" _Incurred Loss Data_ "); and (ii)
true, complete and correct copies of all actuarial reports, actuarial
certificates, and loss recognition analyses prepared by any third party
actuarial consultant on behalf of or made available to the Insurance Company
Subsidiary (the " _Actuarial Analyses_ ") for any period ended on or after
December 31, 2010. The Incurred Loss Data was generated from the same
underlying sources and systems that were utilized by the Acquired Companies
to prepare the Statutory Financial Statements, was derived from the books and
records of the Acquired Companies at the relevant time of preparation (which
preparation was accurate in all material respects), and was, to the Knowledge
of the Sellers, prepared in conformity in all material respects with
applicable Law. The Actuarial Analyses were based on the inventory of policies
in force for the Insurance Company Subsidiary at the relevant time of
preparation, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, were prepared by such
actuarial consultant or consultants using appropriate modeling procedures
actuarially applied, were prepared in conformity with generally accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied, and any projections were prepared
in accordance with the assumptions stated therein.

3.5 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in _Section
3.4(b) of the Companys Disclosure Schedule_, no Acquired Company has any
liability or obligation whether known or unknown and whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not of the type required to
be disclosed in the liabilities column of a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP other than liabilities or obligations to the extent shown
on the balance sheet included in the Year-End GAAP Financial Statements and
current liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the date
of the Year-End Balance Sheet Date.

 

3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in the Interim GAAP
Financial Statements or disclosed in _Section 3.6 of the Companys
Disclosure Schedule_, since the Year-End Balance Sheet Date, each Acquired
Company has conducted its business only in the Ordinary Course of Business and
there has not been any transaction or occurrence in which any
Acquired Company has:

(a) issued or delivered any capital stock or other securities or granted any
options or rights to acquire any capital stock or other securities;

 



11 (b) redeemed, repurchased or retired, converted or exchanged, directly or
indirectly, any shares of capital stock or other security or declared, set
aside or paid any dividends or made any other distributions (whether in cash

(c) incurred any material Debt or become subject to any material Liability,
other than Debts incurred or Liabilities arising in the Ordinary Course of

(h) other than any payments by an Acquired Company of bonuses, benefits or

consultant or entered into or amended any employment, severance, bonus,
retirement, loan or other Contract with any holder of any capital stock,
director, manager, officer, employee or consultant;

 

(i) adopted, amended, or materially increased or decreased the payments to or

be required by Law that are described on _Section 3.6 of the Companys
Disclosure Schedule_;

(j) entered into, modified, terminated or allowed to expire of, or received
notice of termination of, any Contract listed in _Section 3.16(a) of the
Companys Disclosure Schedule_;

 

(k) through negotiation or otherwise, made any commitment or incurred any
Liability, whether or not enforceable, to any labor organization; 

(l) changed any of the accounting principles followed by it or the methods of
applying such principles;

 

(m) released or waived any claim or right of any Acquired Company with a value
in excess of $100,000;

 

(n) incurred any capital expenditure (or series of related capital
expenditures) either involving more than $100,000 or made outside
the Ordinary Course of Business;

 



12 (o) made a capital investment in, loan to, or acquisition of the securities or
assets of, any Person (or series of related capital investments, loans or

Course of Business or relating to an acquisition (by merger, exchange,
consolidation, acquisition of capital stock or assets, or otherwise) of any
Person by any Acquired Company;

(p) hired or committed to hire any key employee or independent contractor, or
terminated or had resign any key employee or independent contractor;

(q) entered into any Contract to take any action described in this Section

material occurrence, event, action, failure to act or transaction outside the

3.7 _Indebtedness_. No Acquired Company has and, as of the Closing Date, no
Acquired Company will have, any Debt (other than Debt that will be repaid in
full on the Closing Date) and the applicable debtor Acquired Company has or
will have repaid in full all loans from the Company Shareholders and any
Affiliate of the Company Shareholders except as set forth in _Section 3.7 of
the Companys Disclosure Schedule_. The indebtedness (including Debt) of each
Acquired Company that is required by GAAP to be included as a liability on the
Companys consolidated balance sheet as of the respective dates of the GAAP
Financial Statements is accurately and completely reflected in the GAAP
Financial Statements, and no Acquired Company is in breach or Default under
any of the terms or conditions set forth in any agreement, document or
instrument related thereto that has not been cured or waived. The indebtedness
of each Acquired Company is prepayable at any time without penalty or premium
at the option of the applicable debtor Acquired Company. Except as set forth
in _Section 3.7 of the Companys Disclosure Schedule_, the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement will not result in any penalty or incurrence of
any additional obligation or change of any terms with respect to any
such indebtedness, and no Acquired Company has any obligations, Liabilities
or indebtedness to any Affiliate of such Acquired Company that will not be
satisfied and terminated at Closing.

 

3.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each Acquired Company has duly and timely filed, or caused to be duly and
timely filed, all material Tax Returns required to be filed by such Acquired
Company on or before the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return has been prepared
in compliance with all applicable Laws, and all such Tax Returns are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes due and
payable by the Acquired Companies have been paid in full (whether or not
shown or required to be shown on any Tax Return). The unpaid Taxes of the
Acquired Companies did not, as of the date of the GAAP Financial Statement,
exceed the Tax Liability accrued on the GAAP Financial Statement and will not
exceed such accrual as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing
Date in accordance with past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies in
filing their Tax Returns. No written claim has been made by a Governmental
Authority in any jurisdiction where any Acquired Company does not file a Tax

 



13  Return that it may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. There are no
Liens (other than Permitted Liens) for Taxes upon any Assets of any Acquired
Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no basis for the
assertion of any such claim for Taxes related to any Acquired Company which,
if adversely determined, could result in the imposition of any Lien on the
Assets of any Acquired Company or otherwise materially adversely affect any
Buyer or any Acquired Companys Assets.

(b) Each Acquired Company has deducted, withheld and timely paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authority all Taxes required by Law to be
deducted, withheld or paid by it in connection with amounts paid or owing to,
or allocated to, any employee, independent contractor, creditor, owner,
stockholder, member or other third party, and each Acquired Company has
timely and accurately complied with all reporting and record keeping
requirements related thereto, including filing of Forms W-2 and 1099s (or
other applicable forms).

 

(c) There is no audit or other examination concerning any Liability for Taxes
of any Acquired Company pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened in writing by any Governmental Authority.

(d) There are no agreements or applications by any Acquired Company for
an extension of time for the assessment or payment of any Taxes or for the
filing of any Tax Return that has not been filed, or waivers of a statute of
limitations by any Acquired Company in respect of Taxes for any Tax Return
that has not been filed. 

(e) No Acquired Company has received from any Governmental Authority any
written notice of proposed adjustment, deficiency, underpayment of income or
other material Taxes or any other such written notice which has not been
satisfied by payment or been resolved.

(f) No Acquired Company has been either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of
this Agreement, or (ii) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute part
of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with this acquisition.

(g) No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change
in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) use of an improper method of accounting for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. income Tax Law) executed on or
prior to the Closing Date, (iv) installment sale or open transaction
disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, (v) prepaid amount received
or deferred revenue accrued on or prior to the Closing Date, (vi) election by
an Acquired Company under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. income Tax Law) made on or prior
to the Closing Date, or (vii) "intercompany transaction" or "excess loss
account" described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax
law) 

 



14  relating to the period prior to the Closing Date. No Acquired Company has
participated in any "listed transaction" or any "reportable transaction," in
each case within the meaning of Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder.

(h) Each Acquired Company has made available to the Buyer for inspection at
its office (i) complete and correct copies of all income and other material

any such insurance policies.

 

3.13 _Insurance Practices; Compliance with Laws_.

of incorporation and each other applicable jurisdiction to write each line of

overall Material

Companys Disclosure Schedule_: (i) each Acquired Company has at all times
been in compliance with each Permit; (ii) no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that could (with or without notice or lapse of time) (A)
constitute or result, directly or indirectly, in a violation of, or a failure
on the part of any Acquired Company to comply with, any such Permit, or (B)
result, directly or indirectly, in the revocation, suspension, cancellation,
termination, limitation, failure to renew or modification of any Permit
except, in the case of the preceding clause (i) or this clause (ii), as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) no Acquired Company has received any
notice or other communication (whether oral or written) from any Governmental

or the Insurance Company Subsidiary which are required to be filed with or
approved by a Governmental Authority, have been so filed or approved and, the
premiums charged conform thereto, and premiums charged to insureds or
policyholders comply with the applicable Law. In respect to WYO Policies,

market conduct claim or complaint with respect to any insurance products that
any Acquired Company has marketed, sold, issued or adjusted claims thereunder
and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there are no facts or circumstances

2014, respectively. The representations and warranties of the Sellers in this

of the Sellers, threatened against the Insurance Company Subsidiary which is
peculiar or unique to such Insurance Company Subsidiary by any state

or would delay or materially impair the ability of the Seller to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Business or the

(m) _Reinsurance Contracts_.

 

(i) _Reinsurance Contracts; Recoverables_. _Section 3.13(m)(i) of the
Companys Disclosure Schedule_ lists all reinsurance agreements in force or

to which any Acquired Company is a party (" _Affiliate Reinsurance Contracts_
"). True, correct and complete copies of all Third Party Reinsurance Contracts

contemplated by this Agreement. The Acquired Companies have not received any
notice to the effect that the financial condition of any other party to any
Existing Reinsurance Contract is impaired with the result that a default
thereunder may reasonably be anticipated, whether or not such default may be
cured by the operation of any offset clause in such agreement. No insurer or
reinsurer or group of affiliated insurers or reinsurers accounted for, in the
aggregate, an aggregate amount equal to two percent or more of the

Authority questioning or challenging such compliance. Each Employee Benefit
Plan intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) has received from the

and no event has occurred that will or is reasonably likely to give rise to
disqualification of any such plan or loss of intended tax consequences
under the Code or to any tax under Code Section 511\. No event has occurred

Acquired Company or any tax-qualified Employee Benefit Plan is reasonably

Section 4975\. All contributions, premiums and payments required to be made

3(35)); (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Sections 4001(a)(3)
and 3(37)) or (iii) a multiple employer plan as described in Section 413(c) of
the Code. No Acquired Company has any liability that is required to be
reserved under GAAP under Title IV of ERISA either directly or through its

benefits, beyond the termination of the employees service with the
applicable Acquired Company or its ERISA Affiliates, other than as required by
the coverage continuation requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA ("COBRA") or a similar state law. No amount that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of cash or property) as a result
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee,
officer, manager or director of any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined under Code
Section 280G) under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other
compensation arrangement or Employee Benefit Plan currently in effect would
be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Code Section 280G). No Acquired Company nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof have
any indemnity or gross-up obligation for any taxes imposed under Code
Sections 4999 or 280G.

(e) None of any Acquired Company or any administrator or fiduciary of any
Employee Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in
any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner which could subject
any Acquired Company or any Buyer to any direct or indirect liability (by
indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary or other
duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms
of, or in connection with, the Employee Benefit Plans other than claims for
benefits that are payable in the Ordinary Course of Business and no action,
proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing or investigation has been commenced
or threatened with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. There are no audits,
investigations or examinations pending by the IRS, the United
States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Authority with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no such
audit, investigation or examination is threatened, and there is no basis for
any such audit, investigation or examination. There is no Litigation with
respect to the administration or the investment of the assets of any Employee
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened and to the Knowledge of the Seller, there
is no basis for any such Litigation.

(f) No "party in interest" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or
"disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Employee
Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (described
in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 



32 (g) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)), to the extent applicable, has
been maintained in compliance in both form and in operation with Code Section
409A, except where such non-compliance may be corrected under IRS correction
programs without any material liability to any Acquired Company or ERISA
Affiliate thereof or any of their respective employees. No Acquired Company
has been required to report to any government or regulatory authority any
corrections made or taxes due as a result of a failure to comply with Code
Section 409A, and does not have any indemnity or gross-up obligation for any
taxes imposed or accelerated under Code Section 409A.

(c) Each Restricted Party agrees that for the term of this Section 6.2, the
Restricted Party will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for itself,

Company, provided that it is of a different kind than the Prohibited Business.

Company or knowledge, information, concepts, strategies or practices that
relate generally to the conduct of insurance business, so long as same does
not otherwise include confidential or proprietary information of any Acquired
Company.

(e) Each Restricted Party hereby agrees and acknowledges that money damages
would not be an adequate remedy for his, her or its breach or threatened
breach of any covenant, obligation or other provision set forth in this
Section 6.2. Each Restricted Party acknowledges that his, her or its violation
of this Section 6.2 will cause irreparable harm to the Acquired Companies and
that damages are not an adequate remedy. Each Restricted Party therefore
agrees (with respect to himself, herself or itself only) that each Acquired
Company, including the Company for itself or by or on behalf of any
other Acquired Company, shall be entitled to injunctive relief enjoining,
prohibiting and restraining the Restricted Party from the continuance of any

construed as separate and independent covenants made by each Restricted Party
separate from any other Restricted Party. Should any part or provision of such
covenants be held invalid, void or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall

 



39  not render invalid, void or unenforceable any other part or provision
thereof. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
if any portion of this Agreement is found to be invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction because its duration, the territory and/or the
restricted activities are invalid or unreasonable in scope, such duration,
territory and/or restricted activity, as the case may be, shall be redefined
by consideration of the reasonable concerns and needs of the business
interests of the Acquired Companies such that the intent of the Buyer, in
consummating the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, will not be
impaired and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under
applicable Laws.

(g) Each Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that the covenants
contained herein are provided in connection with an acquisition by the Buyer
of the Company, the other Acquired Companies and the Business and the goodwill
associated therewith. Each Restricted Party acknowledges that this Section 6.2
is a material inducement to the Buyer entering into this Agreement, and that
the acquisition of the Company (and the other Acquired Companies) as
contemplated by this Agreement is of direct and material benefit to the
Restricted Party and is good and adequate consideration for the covenants
given herein. Each Restricted Party also acknowledges that the Buyer has a
present and future expectation of business within the territory set forth in
Section 6.2(b) above. Each Restricted Party acknowledges the reasonableness
of the term, geographic area and scope of the covenants set forth in this
Section 6.2, and agrees that he, she or it will not, in any action, suit or
other proceeding, deny the reasonableness of, or assert the
unreasonableness of, the premises, consideration or scope of the covenants
set forth herein. Each Restricted Party further acknowledges that complying
with the provisions contained in this Agreement will not preclude him, her or
it from engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business, or from becoming
gainfully employed in such a way as to provide a standard of living for
himself, herself or it, the members of his or her family, and those dependent
upon him or her of the sort and fashion to which he, she and they have become
accustomed and may expect.

(h) The rights and obligations of the Company and each Restricted Party
under this Section 6.2 are personal and are not assignable, and no attempted
assignment thereof or any portion thereof by any Restricted Party shall
release him, her or it from any obligations hereunder. This Section 6.2 shall
inure to the benefit of the Buyer and its successors and assigns.

(a) The Company, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall use

practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement at the Closing.
The Company, the Seller and the Buyer shall use their respective commercially
reasonable, good faith efforts to cause the Acquired Companies to obtain at
the earliest practicable date all of the third party written Consents
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement at the
Closing. Each Party hereto (a) shall make any appropriate filing pursuant to

40  use commercially reasonable efforts to make (and shall reasonably assist
each other in making) all other filings and submissions under the HSR Act or
other Law in connection with the consummation of the transactions

to in the immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b) with the other party, and

dispose of or hold separately (through a trust or otherwise) any assets or
businesses of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(a) After the Closing, each Party shall cooperate with each other Party
and its respective counsel and make him, her or itself reasonably available
to the other Parties in connection with the institution or defense of any

any adjustments hereunder, including providing reasonable access to officers,
directors, managers, employees, former employees, counsel, accountants,

nonrequesting Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the nonrequesting Party. The nonrequesting Party will afford
access to such Records during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice given by the requesting Party. The Company and the Buyer shall make
their respective representatives and employees reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4, a Party
shall not be required to make himself, herself or itself available or make
available any Records if, after receiving advice of such Partys counsel,
doing so would (i) cause a violation of an obligation of confidentiality of
such Party pursuant to an agreement to which such Party is a party, with any
person or entity that is not Affiliate, employee or consultant to such Party
(so long as such Party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such availability), (ii) cause a
risk of a loss of attorney-client, work product, business strategy or other
similar right, protection or privilege available to such Party or (iii)
constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

circumstance. If any such breach relates to the Companys Disclosure Schedule,

portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i)
above (such as Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts,
based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment or property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the
amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereto agree that neither Party
will make a ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any other similar provision of law. In accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76 and any analogous provision of law, any
Tax related to an extraordinary transaction that occurs on the Closing
Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date.

(d) The Sellers and the Buyer shall treat any indemnity payments made
pursuant to this Section 6.9 as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless applicable Tax Law causes such payment not to be so treated.

 

(e) The indemnity and payment obligations set forth in this Section 6.9 shall
survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
applicable under Tax Law plus sixty days; provided, however, that the right to
indemnification with respect to claims of which notice was given prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period (determined as aforesaid)
shall, notwithstanding the foregoing, survive such expiration until such
claim is finally resolved and any obligations with respect thereto are fully
satisfied. The provisions set forth in Article VIII shall have no operative
effect with respect to any indemnification matter described in this Section
6.9.

6.10 _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(a) The Sellers Representative shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be
timely prepared and filed (taking into account requests for extensions to
file such returns), (i) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Acquired Companies in accordance with past practice
(unless a different treatment of any item is required by an applicable Law)
for Tax years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and shall
cause all of the income of each Acquired Company, (including, without
limitation, deferred items triggered into income under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Section
1.1502-19) to be included in the consolidated federal income

 



46  Tax Return of the Affiliated Group of which the Seller is a member and any
state, local or foreign unitary, combined or consolidated Tax Return and (ii)
all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that are due (taking into account requests for
extensions to file such returns) on or before the Closing Date. In each case,
the Sellers Representative shall timely remit (or cause to be timely
remitted) any Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns.

(b) The Buyer shall promptly, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date or, in the case of a Tax Return described in Section 6.10(a) due
prior to the sixtieth (60th) day after the Closing Date, such other date as
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative may reasonably agree, provide (or
cause to be provided) to the Sellers Representative any information
reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to facilitate the preparation and filing of the Tax
Returns described in Section 6.10(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 6.10(b), the Buyer shall not be required to provide (or cause
to be provided) any such information if doing so would (i) cause a violation
of an obligation of confidentiality of the Buyer pursuant to an agreement to
which the Buyer is a party (so long as the Buyer shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
availability), (ii) cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client, work product,
business strategy or other similar right, protection or privilege available to
the Buyer or (iii) constitute a violation of any applicable Law. The
Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) such information in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Company (unless a different treatment
of any item is required by any applicable Law).

 

(c) Except as described in Section 6.10(a), the Buyer shall timely prepare and
file (or cause to be timely prepared and filed) all Tax Returns with respect
to each Acquired Company for Straddle Periods. If such Tax Returns report
matters for which indemnification may be claimed from the Sellers pursuant to
Section 6.9(a), then: (i) the Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared)
such Tax Returns in accordance with past practices of such Acquired Company
(unless a different treatment of any item is required by any applicable Law),
as applicable, (ii) completed drafts of such Tax Returns shall be submitted
to the Sellers Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns, (iii) the Sellers Representative shall have
the right to review and approve each such Tax Return prior to the
filing thereof, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, (iv) without
limiting the obligations of the Sellers under Section 6.9(a), the Buyer shall
remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns
covered by this Section 6.10(c), and (v) the Sellers shall remit the portion
of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date (determined pursuant to Section 6.9(b)) to the Buyer ten (10)
business days before the Tax Return is due (except to the extent that any
such Pre-Closing Taxes are reflected as an accrued liability or reserved
against in the computation of the Final Purchase Price). In connection with
the Sellers Representatives review and approval of any Tax Return under
this Section 6.10(c), the Sellers Representative may submit reasonable
comments to the Buyer within thirty (30) days following the Sellers
Representatives receipt of a draft of the Tax Return, and the Buyer, subject
to the further provisions of this Section, shall incorporate such comments of
the Sellers Representative into such Tax Return. In the event of a
disagreement between the Buyer and the Sellers Representative as to any such
Tax Return, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative will negotiate to
resolve the disputed items in good faith, and after a period of thirty (30)
days, any items remaining in dispute shall be submitted for resolution by the

 



47  Auditor. The Auditor shall reach a determination with respect to the
disputed items no later than thirty (30) days following their submission to
the Auditor, and the Sellers and the Buyer agree that the determination of
the Auditor shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, be
conclusive and binding on both the Sellers and the Buyer (the fees of the
Auditor shall be divided equally between the Sellers and the Buyer).

6.11 _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(a) The indemnified party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying party a
copy of any written communication received by the indemnified party or any of
its Affiliates from a Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes relating to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period for which the Sellers may be
liable under this Agreement and shall promptly notify the indemnifying party
in writing of any pending or threatened audit, claim or demand (a " _Tax
Claim_ ") that could give rise to a right of indemnification, and to the
extent known, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from
any of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent the
indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Sellers may, in their sole discretion, control any Tax Claim. If the
Sellers elect to control such Tax Claim, the Buyer and counsel of its own
choosing shall have the right to participate in, but not direct, the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim at the Buyers sole expense. The
Sellers may not settle any such Tax Claim or administrative or judicial
proceeding without the Buyers written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the Sellers chooses not to control such Tax Claim or
administrative or judicial proceeding, the Buyer shall, at its own
expense, control such Tax Claim or administrative or judicial proceeding and
the Sellers, at its own expense, may participate in such Tax Claim or
administrative or judicial proceeding. The Buyer may not settle any such Tax
Claim or administrative or judicial proceeding without the Sellers written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) The Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Sellers Representative
any refunds, credits or similar benefits relating to Taxes (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, does not include the use of any Qualified High Technology
Business premium tax credits) with respect to taxable periods or portions of
taxable periods of the Acquired Companies on or before the Closing Date or
otherwise for which the Sellers have agreed to provide indemnification under
this Agreement (including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes
incurred in respect of the receipt or accrual of the refund, credits or
similar benefits) other than a refund resulting from a carryback of Tax
attribute from a Tax period ending after the Closing Date. Any payments
required to be made under this Section 6.11 shall be made in readily
available funds within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the refund, credits
or similar benefits or the application of any such refunds as a credit against
Tax for which the Sellers have not otherwise agreed to provide
indemnification under this Agreement.

6.12 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to an Acquired Company,
the Sellers shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or before the
Closing Date all intercompany Tax sharing agreements or arrangements, if any,
to which any Acquired Company, on the one 

 



48  hand, and the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Seller, on the other hand, are
parties, and neither the Sellers nor any Affiliate of the Sellers, on the one
hand, or an Acquired Company, on the other hand, will have any liability
thereunder to each other on or after the Closing Date.

6.13 _Tax Cooperation_. The Sellers and the Buyer shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to an Acquired Company, its assets or
business (including access to books and records as well as the timely
provision of powers of attorney or similar authorizations) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election
related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Governmental Authority,
and the prosecution or defense of any audit, proposed adjustment or
deficiency, assessment, claim, suit or other proceeding relating to any Taxes
or Tax Return. The Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes and all other
Tax matters relating to an Acquired Company, its assets or business and each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.13, a Party shall not be required to
furnish or cause to be furnished information and/or assistance (including
access to books and records) to the other Party if, after receiving advice of
such Partys counsel, doing so would (i) cause a violation of an obligation of
confidentiality of such Party pursuant to an agreement to which such Party is
a party with any person or entity that is not an Affiliate, employee or
consultant to such Party (so long as such Party shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to the furnishing
of such information), (ii) cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client,
work product, business strategy or other similar right, protection or
privilege available to such Party or (iii) constitute a violation of any
applicable Law. The Sellers and the Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, work
papers and all material records or other documents in their possession (or in
the possession of their Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of an Acquired
Company for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (a) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions, and (b) six (6) years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such
time, before the Sellers or the Buyer shall dispose of any such documents in
its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other Party shall
be given an opportunity, after ninety (90) days prior written notice, to
remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other Party may
select (at such other Partys expense). Any information obtained under this
provision shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.

6.14 _338(g) Elections_. The Buyer shall not be permitted to make an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local
Law) with respect to the Acquired Companies.

 

6.15 _No Proposals_. Each of the Sellers and the Company will not and will
cause its officers, directors, affiliates, representatives and agents
(collectively, " _Related Parties_ ") not to directly or indirectly
(including, without limitation, through discussions with, or actions through,
any investment bankers, brokers or similar advisors), (i) submit, solicit,
initiate, encourage or discuss any proposal or offer from any person or entity
(other than the Buyer and its Affiliates) relating to any (A) reorganization,
dissolution or recapitalization of any Acquired Company, (B) 

 



49  merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar transaction or business
combination involving any Acquired Company or its business or equity interests
or assets, (C) sale or disposition of any assets of any Acquired Company or
sale of any capital stock of or other equity interests in any Acquired
Company, (D) any debt or equity financing involving any Acquired Company or
(E) other transaction the consummation of which would prevent, impede, delay
or have an adverse effect on the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement, understanding, or
commitment related to any such transaction or (iii) furnish any information
with respect to or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any
person or entity (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates) to do any of the
foregoing. The Company and the Sellers will and will cause their Related
Parties to terminate all discussions with all third parties (other than the
Buyer and its Affiliates) regarding any of the foregoing and will promptly
notify the Buyer in writing if any person or entity makes any proposal, offer,
inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing or any other similar
communication, and include in such written notice the subject matter of such
proposal, offer, inquiry, contact or communication (including, without
limitation, the terms and conditions of any proposal or offer). Except with
the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers will not
and will cause their Related Parties not to make any announcements or disclose
to any third party (other than those of its Related Parties who need to know
and who agree to treat such information as confidential and other than as
required by law) that it is in discussions with the Buyer and its Affiliates
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby or any its terms.

 

6.16 _Supplement to the Company s Disclosure Schedule_. From time to time
prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall promptly supplement or amend the Companys Disclosure Schedule hereto
with respect to any matter hereafter arising, which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Companys Disclosure Schedule (each a " _Schedule
Supplement_ "). If the Buyer receives a Schedule Supplement, the Buyer shall
have until the Closing Date to determine whether (a) to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.5(d) or (b) to proceed with Closing. If the
Buyer determines to proceed with Closing despite receipt of a Schedule
Supplement, the disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to
have amended the Companys Disclosure Schedule but only for purposes of any
representation or warranty either (a) made at Closing or (b) made in a
certificate to be delivered at Closing.

 

6.17 _2014 Audited Financial Statements_. Within fifty (50) days of the date
hereof, Sellers shall provide the Buyer with the 2014 Audited Financial
Statements and copies of all letters from the Companys auditors to the
Companys board of directors or audit committee thereof relating to the 2014
Audited Financial Statements. If (i) the gross written or gross earned

until March 31, 2017, and then shall expire and be of no further force or
effect; provided that the representations and warranties made in Section 3.1
(Organization, Standing and Power), Section 3.2 (Capitalization of the
Acquired Companies), Section 3.3 (Authorization of Agreement; Enforceability;
No Breach; Consents), Section 3.8 (Tax Matters), subsections (a) through (f)
and (o) of Section 3.13 (Insurance Procedures; Compliance with Laws), Section
3.20 (Benefit Plans), subsection (b) of Section 3.21 (Insurance Procedures),
Section 3.24 (No Brokers or Finders) and Section 4.4 (Title) (collectively, "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive the Closing Date until sixty
(60) days after the applicable statute of limitations has expired. If any
Party provides written notice to the other Party of a Claim (in reasonable
specificity) arising from a breach of a representation or warranty prior to
the expiration of such representations or warrantys applicable survival
period, then such Claim and the underlying representation and warranty as it
relates to such Claim shall survive until it is resolved.

 

8.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations on
indemnification set forth in this Article VIII, each of the Sellers, Other
Seller Parties and Trust Beneficiaries, severally and not jointly, based on
its respective Pro Rata Share, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer and its Affiliates and, from and after the Closing, each Acquired
Company, and each of their respective directors, officers, partners, members,
managers, employees and shareholders (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all damages, losses, deficiencies,
diminution in value, actions, judgments, costs, expenses,

 



56  debts, penalties, fines, liabilities and obligations (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") of or against any
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties resulting from, arising out of or relating
to: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or
such Seller in this Agreement or any Company Ancillary Document or any Seller
Ancillary Document; (b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary
Document; (c) any claim by any Person for a brokerage or finders fee or
commissions or similar payments based upon or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and engaged by any Acquired Company or any
Seller; (d) any Designated Liabilities; (e) any Litigation Liabilities
incurred by the Buyer or the Company related to any claim, complaint, audit,
investigation or similar action by a participant, beneficiary, fiduciary, the
participants representative, the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS, or
similar entity in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan described
in Section 6.6(a) related to events that occur prior to the Closing Date;
provided that there shall be no duplicative payments or indemnities by the
Sellers. The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on warranties,
representations, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any warranty or representation, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreements, will not
affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
warranties, representations, covenants and agreements.

 

8.3 _Agreement of the Trust Beneficiaries_. Each of the parties executing a
joinder hereto is a beneficiary of a trust that is a Direct or Indirect Owner
(each a " _Trust Beneficiary_ "). As a material inducement to the Buyer
entering into this Agreement, each Trust Beneficiary is executing a joinder
hereto to be bound by this Section 8.3 and Section 6.2. Each Trust
Beneficiary acknowledges and agrees that it shall not take any action that
limits or circumvents the ability of any Seller of which the Trust Beneficiary
is a Direct or Indirect Owner to pay its obligations under this Agreement
including without limitation such Sellers obligations under this Article
VIII. Each Trust Beneficiary agrees to indemnify each Buyer Indemnified Party
against, and shall hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from,
any Damages for which that any Seller is liable to a Buyer Indemnified Party
under this Agreement, provided however, such Trust Beneficiarys total
liability under this Section 8.3 shall not exceed such Trust Beneficiarys Pro
Rata Share Cap. Each Seller and each Trust Beneficiary agrees that it shall
not dissolve or liquidate any Seller without such Trust Beneficiary providing
prior written notice to the Buyer and making arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer to ensure that the Trust Beneficiary undertakes and
is subject to the liabilities and obligations of the applicable Seller
hereunder.

8.4  _Indemnification in Favor of the Sellers_. Subject to the limitations on
indemnification set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Sellers and each of their respective directors,
officers, partners, members, managers and shareholders (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Damages of or
against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties resulting from, arising out of
or relating to: (a) any breach of any warranty or representation made by the
Buyer in this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Document; (b) any breach or
non-fulfillment of any covenant

 



57  or agreement of the Buyer set forth in this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary
Document or (c) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of
the Company under Section 6.5 to be performed after the Closing provided that
there shall be no duplicative payments or indemnities by the Buyer. The right
to indemnification or any other remedy based on warranties, representations,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any warranty or representation, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such warranties, representations, covenants and
agreements.

 

8.5 _Procedure Relative to Indemnification_.

 

(a) In the event that any Buyer Indemnified Party or the Company shall receive
actual notice of facts or information giving rise to a claim (a " _Claim_ ")
that it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the terms of this Article
VIII, it (the " _Claiming Party_ ") shall so notify the Sellers
Representative against which the Claim is made (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
in writing promptly after discovery of the facts supporting such Claim. Such
notice shall specify with reasonable specificity and detail each individual
item of Damage included in the amount so stated, the date such item was
incurred, the basis of any anticipated liability and the nature of the breach
of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to which each such item is
related and the computation of the amount to which the Claiming Party claims
to be entitled to hereunder (if determinable). The failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party may, upon receipt of written notice of a Claim and
at its expense, take control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit
or action (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party) in its own name
or, if necessary, in the name of the Claiming Party; _provided that_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of the defense (A)
if the Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
indictment or allegation or any governmental proceeding; (B) if the Claiming
Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the
proceeding or other claim giving rise to such Claim for indemnification would
be materially detrimental to the Claiming Partys reputation or future
business prospects; or (C) unless the Indemnifying Party can demonstrate to
the Claiming Party that the Indemnifying Party can pay in full its
indemnification obligation under this Agreement if an adverse Claim is
rendered. The Claiming Party shall have the right, at its expense, to
participate in the defense. The Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party
will cooperate with each other and make reasonably available to each other
such assistance, employees and materials as may be reasonably requested by the
other. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, neither the Claiming Party nor
the Indemnifying Party shall be required to make reasonably available to the
to the other such assistance, employees or materials if doing so would, after
receiving the advice of such partys counsel, (i) cause a violation of an
obligation of confidentiality of such party pursuant to an agreement to which
such party is a party with any person or entity that is not another
indemnified party or an Affiliate, employee or consultant to 

 



58  such party (so long as such party shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to the furnishing of such
information), (ii) cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client, work product,
business strategy or other similar right, protection or privilege available to
such party or (iii) constitute a violation of any applicable Law. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle and compromise such Claim
only with the prior written consent of the Claiming Party (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , _however_
, that such consent shall not be required if the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party. After the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Claiming Party for any fees or expenses of counsel for the Claiming Party
with respect to the defense of such claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense under Section
8.5(b) within twenty (20) days after receipt of written notice of a Claim, or
shall notify the Claiming Party that it refuses to conduct a defense against a
Claim, then the Claiming Party shall (upon delivering notice to such effect
to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to conduct a defense against such
Claim and shall have the right to settle and compromise such Claim. The Party
undertaking the defense, compromise or settlement of the Claim will keep the
other Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense,
compromise or settlement (with any such compromise or settlement subject to
the provisions of this Section 8.5).

 

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification for Claims under Section 8.2(a) and
Section 8.4(a) only to the extent that the aggregate Damages with respect to
such matters exceed one-half of one percent (.5%) of the Final Purchase Price
(such amount, the " _Threshold_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be responsible for the
aggregate amount of Damages regardless of the Threshold. However, this Section
8.6(a) shall not apply to Claims for breaches of the
Fundamental Representations or to any breach of any of a Sellers or the
Companys representations and warranties of which such Seller had knowledge on
the date on which such representation or warranty was made or any intentional
breach by such Seller or the Company of any covenant or obligation contained
herein, Claims arising out of or relating to the Kingsway Dispute, or Claims
based on fraud.

 

(b) The aggregate amount the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties may recover hereunder under Section 8.2(a) and Section
8.4(a) shall be limited to an amount equal to ten percent 10% of the Final
Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Liability Cap_ "), except in respect of a
Claim for Damages under Section 6.9 or Claims for breach of the Fundamental
Representations, for which the maximum aggregate liability shall be the amount
of the Final Purchase Price, or Claims arising out of or relating to the
Kingsway Dispute or Claims based on fraud, for which there shall be no
maximum aggregate liability limitation.

(c) Except for Damages payable to third parties (all of which third party
damages shall be deemed foreseeable), no Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for any Damages that the Indemnifying Party could not reasonably
have foreseen at the time of execution of this Agreement.

 



59 (d) The aggregate amount that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover
hereunder from each Seller, Other Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary shall be
such partys Pro Rata Share Cap, except for Claims based on fraud by such
Seller, for which there shall be no maximum aggregate liability limitations
and for Claims under the following sentence. As between the Sellers, with
respect to Damages arising from a breach by a Seller of the representations
and warranties found in Article IV for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification hereunder, the breaching Seller shall be solely
responsible for Damages arising therefrom and shall be responsible for one
hundred percent (100%) of such Damages.

 

(e) If any Buyer Indemnified Party has a claim under this Article VIII, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to (a) demand from and sue to
obtain relief from each Seller, Other Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary for
its Pro Rata Share of such liability, (b) pursue and seek a judgment against
each Seller, Other Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary (c) seek Damages and
other remedies set forth herein from each Seller, Other Seller Party and Trust
Beneficiary, provided, however if any Seller, Other Seller Party or Trust
Beneficiary shall pay in full its Pro Rata Share of Damages, then the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to obtain duplicate payment
of those recovered amounts from any other Seller or Other Seller Party or
Trust Beneficiary. By way of example, if Buyer has a claim for $1 million
under Article VIII hereof and Buyer obtains a judgment against each Seller,
Other Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary in the total amount of $1 million,
then if Buyer receives payment from MNE Holdings, Inc. for its Pro Rata Share
of the $1 million (equal to $58,800), then Buyer shall not be entitled to
recover funds from KMK Enterprises LLC or G. Marcus Polivka in respect of the
$1 million, but Buyer shall be entitled to recover funds from each Seller and
Other Seller for its Pro Rata Share of the remaining portion of the $1
million, provided that the aggregate dollar amount payable by MP Holdings LLC
and its direct and indirect owners other than MNE Holdings, Inc., KMK
Enterprises LLC, the G. Markus Polivka Trust and G. Markus Polivka in respect
of the $1 million judgment will be reduced to reflect the payment of the
$58,800. By way of further example, if Buyer has a claim for $1 million under
Article VIII hereof and Buyer obtains a judgment against each Seller, Other
Seller Party and Trust Beneficiary in the total amount of $1 million, then
Buyer receives payment from MP Holdings LLC of its Pro Rata Share of the $1
million ($323,500), then Buyer shall not be entitled to further recover funds
from any Other Seller Party or Trust Beneficiary which is a direct or
indirect owner of MP Holdings LLC with respect to the $1 million judgment.
Buyer shall be entitled to recover the remaining $676,500 of such judgment
only from RM Ocean Harbor Holding, Inc. and its direct and indirect owners.

 

(f) If the Claiming Party receives money from any third party (including
insurance carriers) with respect to a Claim as to which the Claiming Party
has previously indemnified the Claiming Party, then the Claiming Party shall
pay such recovery to the Indemnifying Party, less any expenses in obtaining
such recovery, including reasonable attorneys fees.

 

(g) The sole and exclusive remedy of a Claiming Party with respect to Claims
under or otherwise relating to the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement shall be the indemnification rights set forth in this Article VIII,
except with respect to any intentional breach of any covenant or obligation
contained herein or Claims based on fraud.

 



60 8.7 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payment made pursuant
to this Article VIII shall constitute and be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Tax
Law.

 

8.8 _Calculation of Damages_. For the purpose of calculating the amount of
Damages arising from a breach of a representation or warranty (but not for
determining whether or not any breach has occurred), pursuant to this Article
VIII (i) the representations and warranties shall not be deemed qualified by
any references to "material," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse
Effect" or words or phrases of similar import and (ii) the value of any net
Tax benefit actually and when realized by the indemnified party shall be taken
into account to reduce the amount of Damages recoverable.

8.9 _Setoff_. Upon notice to the Sellers Representative specifying in
reasonable detail the basis therefor, the Buyer may set off any amount to
which it claims to be entitled from the Sellers, under this Article VIII,
against amounts otherwise payable by the Seller under any provision of this
Agreement, other than the Wind Holdback Amounts which are only subject to set
off under Section 2.3 and the Kingsway Holdback Amount which is only subject
to set off under Section 2.4. The exercise of such right of setoff by the
Buyer in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified,
will not constitute a default under this Agreement, regardless of whether the
Seller disputes such setoff claim, or whether such setoff claim is for a
contingent or an unliquidated amount. The exercise of, or the failure
to exercise, such right of setoff will not constitute an election of remedies
or limit the Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that
may be available to it.

 

8.10 _Kingsway Dispute_.

 

(a) The Sellers Representative shall assume the defense of the Kingsway
Dispute at the Sellers Representatives sole expense and by its own counsel.
The Acquired Companies shall cooperate in good faith in such defense;
provided, however, that such cooperation shall not require the Acquired
Companies to (a) incur any out of pocket cost or expense that is not
advanced by the Sellers Representative or (b) take any action that
interferes with the Acquired Companies day to day business operations. The
Acquired Companies shall have the right to participate in the defense of the
Kingsway Dispute with counsel selected by it subject to the Sellers right to
control the defense thereof. The Sellers shall pay and advance the fees and
disbursements of its counsel and the Buyers counsel. If the Sellers fail to
diligently prosecute the defense of the Kingsway Dispute, the Acquired
Companies may, subject to Section 8.10(b), (i) assume and control the defense
thereof and (ii) pay, compromise, settle and defend the Kingsway Dispute and
seek indemnification from the Sellers and the Other Seller Parties for any
and all Damages based upon, arising from or relating to the Kingsway Dispute.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not enter into settlement of the Kingsway Dispute without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, the Sellers may settle the Kingsway Dispute without the
prior written consent of the Buyer if both (i) the Sellers provide the Buyer
with ten (10) business days notice of such settlement together with all
settlement agreements and other documents related thereto and (ii) the
settlement provides for (A) a full and unconditional release of the Acquired
Companies and (B) the sole relief is money damages, which money damages are
paid in full by the Sellers.

their effects.

Auditor pursuant to Section 2.2(b), Section 2.3(b), Section 2.3(c) and Section

be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach by any Party to
this Agreement of any covenant, obligation or other provision set forth in
this Agreement for the benefit of any other Party to this Agreement, and
further agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
Party to this Agreement of any covenant, obligation or other provision set
forth in this Agreement for the benefit of any other Party to this Agreement,
such other Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it pursuant to this Agreement) to (a) a decree or order of
specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant, obligation or other

 



65  provision, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach. The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the

9.20 _Sellers  Representative; Power of Attorney_. Each of the Sellers and
each of the Other Seller Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
designate and appoint the Sellers Representative as their true and lawful
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in
each Sellers and Other Seller Partys name and on each Sellers and Other
Seller Partys behalf, to execute any and all instruments or other documents
on behalf of the Sellers and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf
of the Sellers and Other Seller Parties which the Sellers Representative may
deem necessary or advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the consummation of this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall have the full
and exclusive power and authority to: (i) agree with Buyer with respect to any
matter or thing required or deemed necessary by the Sellers Representative
in connection with the provisions of this Agreement calling for the agreement
of the Sellers and Other Seller Parties, give and receive written notices on
behalf of

 



66  all Sellers and Other Seller Parties, and act on behalf of the Sellers and
Other Seller Parties in connection with any matter as to which the Sellers and
Other Seller Parties (or any one or more of them) are or may be obligated to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party under this Agreement, all in the
absolute discretion of the Sellers Representative; (ii) in general, do all
things and perform all acts, including, without limitation, executing and
delivering all agreements, amendments, certificates, receipts, consents,
elections, instructions and other instruments or documents contemplated by, or
deemed by the Sellers Representative to be necessary or advisable in
connection with, this Agreement; and (iii) agree upon, resolve and compromise
any issue or dispute related to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII. This
appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest and
is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement and is
irrevocable and will not be terminated by any act of any Seller or any Other
Seller Party or operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any
Seller or Other Seller Party or the occurrence of any event. Each Seller and
Other Seller Party hereby irrevocably consents to the taking of any and all
actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken or
made by Sellers Representative pursuant to this Section 9.20. The parties to
this Agreement shall cooperate with the Sellers Representative and any
accountants, attorneys or other agents whom they may retain to assist in
carrying out their duties hereunder. Except as specifically provided for in
this Section 9.20, the Sellers Representative may communicate with the
Sellers and Other Seller Parties or any other Person concerning their
responsibilities hereunder, but they are not required to do so. In the event
the Sellers Representative does elect to so communicate with the Sellers and
Other Seller Parties, any decisions or actions hereunder remain within the
Sellers Representatives discretion. The Sellers Representative has a duty
to serve in good faith the interests of the Sellers and to perform their
designated role under this Agreement, but the Sellers Representative shall
have no personal financial liability whatsoever to any Person relating to
their service hereunder, except that they shall be personally liable for harm
which they directly cause by an act of willful misconduct. Sellers
Representative may resign at any time by notifying the Buyer in writing;
_provided_ that a successor shall have agreed to replace Sellers
Representative upon such resignation. The provisions of this Section 9.20
shall in no way impose any obligations on the Buyer. In particular,
notwithstanding any notice received by the Buyer to the contrary and absent
bad faith or willful misconduct, the Buyer (i) shall be fully protected in
relying upon and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no liability
to any Seller or Other Seller Parties with respect to, actions, decisions and
determinations of the Sellers Representative, and (ii) shall be entitled to
assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Sellers
Representative are fully authorized by all of the Sellers and Other Seller
Parties.
