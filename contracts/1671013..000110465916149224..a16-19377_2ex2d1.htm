Subsidiaries; and (C) any other undertaking or remedy whatsoever that may be
necessary in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or eliminate any other
impediment under any Antitrust Law, including contesting, defending and
appealing any action to prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby or, in
the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any action or
proceeding seeking to prohibit the transactions or delay the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby beyond the Outside Date, provided that any
such divestiture, disposition, undertaking or remedy may be conditioned upon
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any requirement in this Section 5.6 _,_ Section 5.2 or in
Section 7.6, where a Party (in this Section 5.6(c) only, a " **Disclosing
Party** ") is required under this Section 5.6 _,_ Section 5.2 or Section 7.6
to provide information to another Party (in this Section 5.6(c) only, a "
**Receiving Party** ") that the Disclosing Party deems to be competitively
sensitive information, the Disclosing Party may restrict the provision of such
competitively sensitive information only to the external legal counsel of the
Receiving Party, provided that the Disclosing Party also provides a redacted
version of any such application, notice, filing, submissions, undertakings,
correspondence or communications (including responses to requests for
information and inquiries from any Governmental Entity) which contains the
competitively sensitive information.

 



 

 **5.7** **Pre-Acquisition Reorganization; Bump Transaction**

 



 

(a) DirectCash agrees that, upon request of the Parent, DirectCash shall use
all reasonable commercial efforts to: (i) effect such reorganizations of
DirectCash and the DirectCash Subsidiaries respective corporate structure,
capital structure, business, operations and assets or such other transactions
as the Parent may request, acting reasonably (including the continuance of
DirectCash and/or any of the DirectCash Subsidiaries under the Laws of another
jurisdiction or amending the organizational documents of any relevant entity
(each, a " **Pre-Acquisition Reorganization** "); and (ii) cooperate with the
Parent and its advisors in order to determine the nature of the Pre-
Acquisition Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in which
they might most effectively be undertaken; _provided_ that DirectCash shall be
required to take the foregoing actions only to the extent that DirectCash
determines in good faith that: (A) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations are not
prejudicial or adverse to DirectCash or any of the DirectCash Subsidiaries
(having regard to the indemnities provided herein), (B) the Pre-Acquisition
Reorganizations do not impair the ability of any of the Parties to complete
the Arrangement or delay the completion of the Arrangement; (C) the Pre-
Acquisition Reorganizations are only effected on the Closing Date (or earlier
if mutually agreed upon by the Parties); (D) none of DirectCash or any of the
DirectCash Subsidiaries is required to take any action that could reasonably
be expected to result in Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other
consequences to, any DirectCash Shareholder incrementally greater than the
Taxes or other consequences to such party in connection with the completion of
the Arrangement in the absence of action being taken pursuant to this Section
5.7; (E) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not result in any breach by
DirectCash or any of the

 



      
 

 



 

DirectCash Subsidiaries of any Contract or any breach by DirectCash or any of
the DirectCash Subsidiaries of their respective organizational documents or
Law; (F) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of DirectCash or the DirectCash Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (G) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not require
DirectCash to obtain approval of the DirectCash Shareholders (other than in
respect of the Arrangement Resolution at the DirectCash Meeting); and (H) the
Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not impact the value or type of
consideration to be received by DirectCash Shareholders under the Arrangement.
The Parent shall provide written notice to DirectCash of any proposed Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization at least 15 Business Days prior to the Effective
Time. Upon receipt of such notice, the Parent and DirectCash shall work co-
operatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the
Effective Time all documentation necessary and do all such other acts and
things as are reasonably necessary, including making amendments to this
Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement, to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization; _provided_ that such amendments do not require DirectCash to
obtain any additional approval of the DirectCash Shareholders (other than as
properly put forward and approved at the DirectCash Meeting). If the
Arrangement is not completed, the Parent shall, upon request by DirectCash (x)
forthwith reimburse DirectCash for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proposed Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization; and (y) indemnify DirectCash for any direct losses, direct
damages, reasonable costs and expenses, interest awards, judgments, penalties
and Taxes (other than those reimbursed in accordance with the foregoing)
suffered or incurred by DirectCash or any of the DirectCash Subsidiaries in
connection with or resulting from any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and in
connection with or resulting from reversing or unwinding any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization (where such reversal is determined by DirectCash to be
necessary, acting reasonably).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, DirectCash acknowledges
that the Parent may enter into transactions (the " **Bump Transactions** ")
designed to step up the Tax basis in certain capital property of DirectCash
for purposes of the Tax Act and agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to
provide information reasonably requested by the Parent and available to
DirectCash in this regard on a timely basis, and to assist in obtaining any
such information required or desired by the Parent to facilitate a successful
completion of the Bump Transactions or any other such reorganizations or
transactions, as is reasonably requested by the Parent.

(a) Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, of any event or
state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be reasonably
likely to:

 



 

(i) cause any of the representations or warranties of any Party
contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any

that such information has not previously been returned or destroyed, and shall
use its reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that such requests are
honoured in accordance with the terms of such agreement.

(ii) enter into or otherwise engage or participate in any discussions
or negotiations with any person regarding any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, or propose publicly or state

(vi) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

(e) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(d), or any other provision hereof, DirectCash
shall be permitted to enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any third party in response to an Acquisition Proposal by
such person and may provide copies of, or access to or disclosure of
information, properties, facilities, books or records of DirectCash if and
only if:

 



 

(i) the Board first determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that based on the information then available
and after consultation with its financial advisor(s), such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead
to, a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

 



 

(ii) such person was not restricted from, or had not otherwise been
released from (except in accordance with the terms of any applicable agreement
without any action by DirectCash), making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to an existing confidentiality, standstill, non-disclosure or similar
agreement, restriction or covenant with DirectCash;

 



 

(iii) DirectCash has been, and would be after entering into or

DirectCash enters into a confidentiality and standstill agreement with such
person with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such
person as the Confidentiality Agreement and any such copies, access or
disclosure provided to such person shall have already been (or simultaneously
be) provided to the Parent; and

 



 

(v) DirectCash provides the Parent with:

 



 

(A) prompt written notice stating the intention of DirectCash to
participate in such discussions or negotiations and to provide such copies,
access or disclosure; and

complete and final executed copy of the confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 7.2(e)(iv).

 



 

(f) DirectCash shall promptly notify the Parent, at first orally and then
within 48 hours in writing, of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request
relating to, or constituting an Acquisition Proposal or any amendments to the
foregoing or any request for non-public information relating to DirectCash in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
facilities, books or records of DirectCash or any of the DirectCash
Subsidiaries by any person that informs DirectCash that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto. If in
writing or electronic form, DirectCash shall provide a copy thereof to the
Parent, and if not in writing or electronic form, a description of the terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or
request and shall provide the identity of the person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry, offer or request. DirectCash shall
keep the Parent fully informed of the status of, developments to and any
change in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or proposal, inquiry,
offer or request. DirectCash shall provide to the Parent copies of all
correspondence if in writing or electronic form, and if not in writing or
electronic form, a description of the terms of such correspondence sent to
DirectCash by or on behalf of any person making any such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(g) If DirectCash receives an Acquisition Proposal, the Board may accept,
approve or recommend such Acquisition Proposal and enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal if and only if:

 



 

(i) the Board first determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(ii) the person making the Superior Proposal was not restricted from
making such Superior Proposal pursuant to an existing confidentiality,
standstill, non-disclosure or similar agreement, restriction or covenant;

 



 

(iii) DirectCash has been, and continues to be, in compliance with all
of its obligations under this Section 7.2;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) DirectCash has provided the Parent with written notice of the
determination of the Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Board to enter into such
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, together with a
written notice from the Board regarding the value and financial terms that the
Board, in consultation with its financial advisor(s), has determined should be
ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered under such Acquisition Proposal
(the " **Superior Proposal Notice** ");

 



 

(v) DirectCash has provided the Parent with a copy of the proposed
definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal and all supporting materials;

 



 

(vi) at least five (5) Business Days (the " **Matching Period** ")
have elapsed from the date that is the later of the date on which the Parent
received the Superior Proposal Notice and the date on which the Parent
received all of the materials set forth in Section 7.2(g)(v);

 



 

(vii) during any Matching Period, the Parent have had the opportunity
(but not the obligation), in accordance with Section 7.2(h), to offer to amend
this Agreement and the Arrangement in order for such Acquisition Proposal to
cease to be a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(viii) after the expiry of the Matching Period, the Board: (A) has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal (if applicable, compared to the terms of the
Arrangement as proposed to be amended by the Parent under Section 7.2(h)); and
(B) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that recommending that DirectCash enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal is necessary in order for the Board to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(ix) DirectCash concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(d)(ii); and

 



 

(x) DirectCash has previously, or concurrently shall have, paid to
Parent (or such Parent affiliate as the Parent may designate) the Termination
Fee.

 



 

(h) During the Matching Period, or such longer period as DirectCash may
approve in writing for such purpose: (i) the Board shall review any offer made
by the Parent under Section 7.2(g)(vii) to amend the terms of this Agreement
and the Arrangement in good faith in order to determine whether such proposal
would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal previously
constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal; and (ii)
DirectCash shall negotiate in good faith with the Parent to make such
amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable
the Parent to proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby on such
amended terms. If the Board determines that such Acquisition Proposal would
cease to be a Superior Proposal, DirectCash shall promptly so advise the
Parent and DirectCash and the Parent shall amend this Agreement to reflect
such offer made by the Parent, and shall take and cause to be taken all such
actions as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The Board shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement by
news release after any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or made if:
(i) the Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior
Proposal; or (ii) the Board determines that an amendment to the terms of the
Arrangement as contemplated under Section 7.2(g)(vii) has been agreed that
results in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. The Parent
and its counsel and other advisors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the form and content of any such news release.

 



 

(j) Each successive amendment or modification of any Acquisition Proposal
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2
and the Parent shall be afforded a new Matching Period from the later of the
date on which the Parent received the Superior Proposal Notice and the date on
which the Parent received all of the materials set forth in Section 7.2(g)(v)
with respect to the new Superior Proposal from DirectCash. In the event that
either (A) an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, or (B) DirectCash
provides the notice in Section 7.2(g)(iv), in each case on a date that is less
than 10 Business Days prior to the DirectCash Meeting, the Parent shall be
entitled to require DirectCash to adjourn or postpone the DirectCash Meeting
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to a date that is no more than
10 Business Days after the scheduled date of the DirectCash Meeting, provided
that in no event will such adjourned or postponed meeting be held on a date
that is less than 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

(k) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board from: (i)
withdrawing, qualifying or modifying its recommendation of the Arrangement in
a manner adverse to AcquisitionCo following the date hereof if the Board has
received a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Board makes the determination that it would be reasonably likely
to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue
to recommend the Arrangement to the DirectCash Shareholders or (ii) complying
with Section 2.17 of Multilateral Instrument 62-104 _Takeover Bids and Issuer
Bids_ and similar provisions under Securities Laws relating to the provision
of directors circulars and making appropriate disclosure to its
securityholders.

 



 

 **7.3** **Termination Fee**

 



 

(a) DirectCash shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or to such affiliate
of Parent as it may direct in writing) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ")
if:

 



 

(i) the Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(c)(i) or 8.2(c)(iii), in which case payment shall be made within
two (2) Business Days of such termination;

 



 

(ii) DirectCash shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(d)(ii); or

 



 

(iii) after the date hereof, but prior to the termination of this
Agreement: (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or a
person shall have publicly announced an intention to do so; (B)(1) the
Shareholders Vote shall not have been held prior to the Outside Date, or (2)
the Shareholders Vote shall have been held prior to the Outside Date, while
any Acquisition Proposal remains

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding and the Arrangement Resolution shall not have been approved
pursuant thereto; and (C) within twelve (12) months after the date of the
termination of this Agreement, a transaction to effect any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (A) above) is consummated by DirectCash, in
which case payment shall be made on the date on which such Acquisition
Proposal is consummated. In such event, the Termination Fee shall be paid upon
the consummation of the transaction referred to in this Section 7.3(a)(iii).

 



 

(b) DirectCash shall only be obligated to pay the Termination Fee once
pursuant to this Section 7.3.

 



 

(c) In the event that DirectCash determines that the Termination Fee is
subject to Tax withholding, then the Parent shall have the right to elect in
writing to delay receipt of the Termination Fee (without accrual of interest)
for such period of time as Parent elects in order to make representations to
the relevant Governmental Entity or to DirectCash as to the applicability of
such Tax or the appropriate Tax withholding rate. DirectCash agrees to comply
with any specific written determination provided by the relevant Governmental
Entity regarding the incidence of any such Tax.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if DirectCash shall
fail to pay in a timely manner the Termination Fee due pursuant to this
Section 7.3 and in order to obtain such payment, the Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against DirectCash for the Termination Fee that has
become final and non-appealable, DirectCash shall pay interest on the
Termination Fee from the date that the payment of the Termination Fee was due
to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to the prime rate published by
the Royal Bank of Canada for the relevant period, together with the costs and
expenses of the Parent (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit.

 



 

 **7.4** **Liquidated Damages**

 



 

The Parties acknowledge that the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in
Section 7.3 is the payment of liquidated damages that is a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages the Parent will suffer or incur as a result of the
event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this
Agreement and is not a penalty. DirectCash irrevocably waives any right it may
have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, the Parent agrees that the right of the
Parent to receive payment of the amount determined pursuant to Section 7.3 in
the manner provided therein is the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent in
respect of the event giving rise to such payment.

 



 

 **7.5** **Fees and Expenses**

 



 

Each Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Party in
connection with this Agreement and the Arrangement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parent shall pay the filing fees required to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals, including any applicable Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.6** **Access to Information; Confidentiality**

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with Section 5.7(c),
applicable Law and the terms of any existing Contracts, DirectCash shall, and
shall cause the DirectCash Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, DirectCash Employees, independent auditors, advisers and agents to
afford to the Parent and to their officers, employees, agents and
representatives such access as the Parent may reasonably require at all
reasonable times to its officers, senior employees, agents, offices,
properties, books, records and Contracts, and shall make available to the
Parent all data and information as the Parent may reasonably request, provided
such access does not cause any unreasonable disruption to the business and
operations of DirectCash prior to the Effective Time. The Parent acknowledges
and agrees that all such information provided pursuant to this Section 7.6 is
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) DirectCash shall provide information and reasonable assistance to the
Parent in implementing a communications plan of the Parent in respect of
DirectCash Employees. The Parent shall consult with and consider the
reasonable comments of DirectCash in connection with the implementation of
such plan. DirectCash shall coordinate reasonable access to DirectCash
Employees, from time to time, as reasonably requested by the Parent and may
attend and participate in any discussions or presentations in connection
therewith.

 



 

 **7.7** **Privacy Matters**

 



 

(a) Each Disclosing Party acknowledges and confirms that the disclosure of
Transferred Information is necessary for the purposes of determining if the
Parties shall proceed with the Acquisition, and that the disclosure of
Transferred Information relates solely to the carrying on of the business and
the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Each Disclosing Party covenants and agrees to, upon request, use its
reasonable commercial efforts to advise the Recipient of all documented
purposes for which the Transferred Information was initially collected from or
in respect of the individual to which such Transferred Information relates and
all additional documented purposes where the Disclosing Party has notified the
individual of such additional purpose, and where required by Law, obtained the
consent of such individual to such use or disclosure.

 



 

(c) In addition to its other obligations hereunder, the Recipient covenants
and agrees to: (i) prior to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, collect, use and disclose the Transferred Information solely for the
purpose of reviewing and completing the transactions contemplated hereby,
including for the purpose of determining whether to complete such
transactions; (ii) after the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, collect, use and disclose the Transferred Information only for those
purposes for which the Transferred Information was initially collected from or
in respect of the individual to which such Transferred Information relates or
for the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless (A) the
Disclosing Party or the Recipient have first notified such individual of such
additional purpose and, where required by Laws, obtained the consent of such
individual to such additional purpose, or (B) such use or disclosure is
permitted or authorized by Law, without notice to, or consent from, such
individual; (iii) where required by Law, promptly notify the individuals to
whom the Transferred Information relates that the transactions contemplated
hereby have taken

 



      
 

 



 

place and that the Transferred Information has been disclosed to the
Recipient; (iv) after the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
give effect to any withdrawal of consent made by an individual to whom the
Transferred Information relates; (v) return or destroy the Transferred
Information, at the option of the Disclosing Party, should the transactions
contemplated hereby not be completed; and (vi) notwithstanding any other
provision herein, where the disclosure or transfer of Transferred Information
to the Recipient requires the consent of, or the provision of notice to, the
individual to which such Transferred Information relates, to not require or
accept the disclosure or transfer of such Transferred Information until the
Disclosing Party has first notified such individual of such disclosure or
transfer and the purpose for such disclosure or transfer, and, where required
by Laws, obtained the individuals consent to such disclosure or transfer and
to only collect, use and disclose such information to the extent necessary to
complete the transactions contemplated hereby and as authorized or permitted
by Laws.

 



 

(d) The Recipient shall at all times keep strictly confidential all
Transferred Information provided to it, and shall instruct those employees or
advisors responsible for processing such Transferred Information to protect
the confidentiality of such information in a manner consistent with the
Recipients obligations hereunder and according to applicable Laws. The
Recipient shall ensure that access to the Transferred Information shall be
restricted to those employees or advisors of the Recipient who have a bona
fide need to access such information in order to complete the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) The Recipient shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to protect and
safeguard the Transferred Information including, without limitation, to
protect the Transferred Information from loss or theft, unauthorized access,
disclosure, copying, use, modification, disposal or destruction and promptly
advise the Disclosing Party should any such loss, theft or unauthorized
activity occur and shall only use, disclose, process, store or enable access
to such Transferred Information in Canada, the United States or such other
jurisdictions as Disclosing Party may approve in writing from time to time.

 



 

 **7.8** **Insurance and Indemnification**

 



 

(a) The Parent will, or will cause DirectCash and the DirectCash Subsidiaries
to, maintain in effect without any reduction in amount or scope for six years
from the Effective Time customary policies of directors and officers
liability insurance providing protection no less favourable to the protection
provided by the policies maintained by DirectCash and the DirectCash
Subsidiaries that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Parent
and DirectCash shall not be required, in order to maintain such directors and
officers liability insurance policy, to pay an annual premium in excess of
300% of the costs of the existing policies. Prior to the Effective Time,
DirectCash may, in the alternative, with the prior written consent of the
Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, purchase run-off directors and
officers liability insurance for a period of six years from the Effective
Time and in such event, none of the Parent, DirectCash or any of the
DirectCash Subsidiaries shall have any further obligation under this Section
7.8(a).

 



 

(b) The Parent agrees that it shall directly honor all rights to
indemnification or exculpation agreements, arrangements or rights now existing
in favour of present and former officers and directors of DirectCash and the
DirectCash Subsidiaries. All rights to indemnification

 



       
 

 



 

or exculpation shall survive the completion of the Arrangement and the
provisions of this Section 7.8 shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors of the Parent.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified person, his or her heirs,
executors, administrators and legal representatives and, for such purpose,
DirectCash hereby confirms that it is acting as agent and trustee on their
behalf.

 



 

 **7.9** **De-Listing of Common Shares**

 



 

Subject to applicable Laws, the Parent and DirectCash shall use their
reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Common Shares to be delisted from
the Exchange promptly following the completion of the Arrangement.

 



 

 **7.10** **Resignations**

 



 

DirectCash shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain and deliver
to the Parent at the Effective Time evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent of the resignations, effective as of the Effective Time, of all of the
directors and officers of DirectCash requested by the Parent. Such
resignations shall be received in consideration for the Parent and DirectCash
providing releases to each such persons (in a form satisfactory to the Parent
and such resigning person, each acting reasonably) (the " **Mutual Releases**
"), which Mutual Releases shall contain exceptions for amounts or obligations
owing to such directors and/or officers for accrued but unpaid salary,
directors fees, bonuses, or other payments due pursuant to the Arrangement as
a DirectCash Shareholder, benefits and other compensation or pursuant to
indemnity or directors and officers insurance arrangements or any Employee
Obligations.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII _ 
TERM, TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_**

 



 

 **8.1** **Term**

 



 

This Agreement shall be effective from the date hereof until the earlier of

time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of the Parent
and DirectCash.

 



 

(b) _Termination by any Party_. This Agreement may be terminated by either of
the Parent or DirectCash at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(i) if the Effective Time has not occurred on or prior to the
Outside Date, except that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
clause shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any of its
obligations in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date; or

 



 

(ii) if the Arrangement Resolution is not approved by the
Shareholders Vote at the DirectCash Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof) in accordance with the Interim Order;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Termination by the Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(i) if:

recommend this Agreement or the Arrangement in the manner contemplated by
Section 2.6;

 



 

(B) the Board or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn, withheld or
qualified, amended or modified in a manner adverse to the Parent, its
unanimous approval or recommendation of the Arrangement, or the Board or any
committee thereof publicly announces its intention to do, or that it has done,
any of the foregoing;

 



 

(C) the Board or any committee of the Board accepts, approves, endorses or
recommends, or publicly proposes to accept, approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal, or the Board fails to recommend against acceptance of a
publicly announced, or otherwise publicly disclosed, Acquisition Proposal for
more than five (5) Business Days after the Parent request in writing, that it
do so;

Parent;

 



 

(ii) subject to Section 7.1, if the Parent are not in breach of any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and DirectCash breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or breaches would, individually or in the aggregate,
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section
6.2;

 



 

(iii) DirectCash breaches any of its covenants or agreements in Section 7.2 in
any material respect; or

 



 

(iv) if all of the conditions to the completion of the Arrangement for the
benefit of the Parent have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to the
date specified for such conditions to be satisfied or, in the absence of any
such date, on or prior to the Outside Date, other than as a result of a breach
of this Agreement by either of the Parent.

 



 

(d) _Termination By DirectCash_. This Agreement may be terminated by
DirectCash at any time prior to the Effective Time if:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) subject to Section 7.1, DirectCash is not in breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and either of the Parent breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breaches would, individually or in the aggregate, give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3;

 



 

(ii) DirectCash enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal in compliance with the provisions of Section 7.2(g),
provided that DirectCash is then in compliance with Section 7.2 and further
provided that DirectCash has previously paid or concurrently pays to the
Parent (or an affiliate of the Parent as designated by Parent) the Termination
Fee; or

 



 

(iii) if all of the conditions to the completion of the Arrangement
for the benefit of DirectCash have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to

breach of this Agreement by DirectCash.

 



 

(e) _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and of no further force or effect and no Party shall
have any further obligations or liability hereunder except as provided in
Section 7.3, Section 7.4, Section 7.5, Section 7.7, Section 9.2, Section 9.3,
Section 9.7 and this Section 8.2(e) and as otherwise expressly contemplated
hereby. For greater certainty, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2, the Parties obligations in
regards to Transferred Information, as provided for in Section 7.7 and the
Parties obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive such
termination. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party from
liability for any breach by it of this Agreement that occurred prior to the
date of termination. In addition, nothing in this Section 8.2 shall limit any
remedies of a Party for specific performance under Section 9.3 prior to
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.3** **Amendment**

 



 

This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at any time and from time to
time before or after the holding of the DirectCash Meeting but not later than
the Effective Time, be amended by mutual written agreement of the Parties,
without further notice to or authorization on the part of the DirectCash
Shareholders, and any such amendment may, subject to the Interim Order and
Final Order and applicable Laws, without limitation:

 



 

(a) change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts
of the Parties;

 



 

(b) modify any representation or warranty contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto;

 



 

(c) modify any of the covenants contained herein and modify
performance of any of the obligations of the Parties; and/or

 



 

(d) modify any conditions precedent contained herein,

 



      
 

 



 

provided that no such amendment reduces or materially adversely affects the
consideration to be received by a DirectCash Shareholder without approval by
the affected DirectCash Shareholders given in the same manner as required for
the approval of the Arrangement or as may be ordered by the Court.

 



 

 **8.4** **Waiver**

 



 

DirectCash, on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other hand, may:

 



 

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other;

 



 

(b) waive compliance with any of the others agreements or the
fulfillment of any conditions to its own obligations contained herein; or

 



 

(c) waive inaccuracies in any of the others representations or
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other;

 



 

provided, however, that any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Parties and,
unless otherwise provided in the written waiver, shall be limited to the
specific breach, covenant or condition waived. A Partys failure or delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of
that right. A single or partial exercise of any right shall not preclude a
Party from any other further exercise of that right or the exercise of any
other right.

 **9.2** **Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial**

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the Laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal Laws of Canada
applicable therein, and shall be construed and treated in all respects as an
Alberta contract. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Alberta in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement and the
Arrangement. Each Party hereby waives any right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.3** **Equitable Remedies**

 



 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, except as provided
for in Section 7.4, the Parties shall be entitled to equitable remedies,
including specific performance, a restraining order and interlocutory,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with obtaining any such
injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived. Such remedies shall
not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but shall be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of the
Parties.

 



 

 **9.4** **Assignment, Binding Effect and Entire Agreement**

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 2.15), neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other Parties hereto.

 



 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(c) This Agreement (including the Recitals and Schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties,
and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and
discussions, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no representations, warranties,
covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral,
statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.
Other than the Disclosure Letter, the DirectCash Public Disclosure Record and
the Data Room Materials, the Parties have not relied on and are not relying on
any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into and
completing the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **9.5** **Further Assurances**

 



 

Each Party shall, from time to time and at all times hereafter, at the request
of the other Parties, but without further consideration, do all such further
acts and things, and execute and deliver all such further documents and
instruments and provide all such further assurances as may be reasonably
required in order to fully perform and carry out the terms and intent hereof.

 



 

 **9.6** **Severability**

 



 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **9.7** **No Third Party Beneficiaries**

 



 

Except as provided in Section 7.8 and except for the rights of the DirectCash
Shareholders to receive the Cash Consideration for their Common Shares
contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement following the Effective Time, which
rights are hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Parent, this Agreement shall
not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties to
this Agreement. The Parent appoint DirectCash as the trustee for the
DirectCash Employees and the directors and officers of DirectCash and the
DirectCash Subsidiaries, as applicable, of the covenants of the Parent as
specified in Section 7.8 of this Agreement and DirectCash accepts such
appointment and agrees to hold the benefit and enforce the performance of such
covenants on behalf of such persons.

 



 

 **9.8** **Counterparts, Execution**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The Parties shall be entitled to rely upon

 



      
 

 



 

delivery of an executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this
Agreement, and such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall be
legally effective to create a valid and binding agreement between the Parties.

 



 

[ ** _Signature_** ** _Page Follows_**]

 



      
 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date of this Agreement by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized.
