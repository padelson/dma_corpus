</FONT>Set forth on <U>Schedule 5.08</U> is a true and accurate record, as of the date identified on <U>Schedule 5.08</U>, of the
balance invested in a trust account at UBS Financial Services Inc. (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Account</U>&rdquo;), maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, a New York corporation, acting as trustee (the &ldquo;<U>Trustee</U>&rdquo;), pursuant to the
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and between Acquiror and the Trustee (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Agreement</U>&rdquo;).
The Trust Agreement is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Acquiror and, to the knowledge
of Acquiror, the Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors&rsquo; rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity. The Trust Agreement has not been terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended or supplemented or modified,
in any respect, and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no such termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification
is contemplated. There are no side letters and there are no agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written
or oral, with the Trustee or any other Person that would (i) cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror SEC Reports
to be inaccurate or (ii) entitle any Person (other than any Acquiror Stockholder who is a Redeeming Stockholder) to any portion
of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except
in accordance with the Trust Agreement, Acquiror Organizational Documents and Acquiror&rsquo;s final prospectus dated March 5,
2020. Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United States Government securities or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Acquiror has performed all material obligations
required to be performed by it to date under, and is not in material default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other
respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute such a default or breach thereunder. There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror,
threatened with respect to the Trust Account. Acquiror has not released any money from the Trust Account (other than interest income
earned on the principal held in the Trust Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the Effective Time, the obligations
of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents shall terminate, and, as of the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate
the assets of Acquiror by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Following the Effective Time, no
Acquiror Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent such Acquiror Stockholder
is a Redeeming Stockholder.</P>

</FONT><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><U>Subscription Agreements</U></FONT>. Subject to the terms hereof,
Acquiror shall and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the Subscription Agreements.
Acquiror shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach by any party to the Subscription Agreements of which Acquiror has become
aware or any termination (or alleged or purported termination) of the Subscription Agreements. Acquiror shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Equity Financing
and shall not permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Subscription
Agreements entered into at or prior to the date hereof if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (i) would materially delay
the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) reduces the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing, (iii) adds or imposes new conditions
or amends the existing conditions to the consummation of the Equity Financing or (iv) is adverse to the interests of the Company,
in each case, in any material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to obtain the proceeds from the Equity Financing
shall not relieve Acquiror of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such
Equity Financing is available. In the event that any portion of the Equity Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in each Subscription Agreement, regardless of the reason therefor, and such portion of the Equity Financing is required
to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, Acquiror will (i) as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing (the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><U>Alternative
Financing</U></FONT>&rdquo;) (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with any then-available Equity Financing and available
cash of Acquiror, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the Outstanding Company Expenses and
Outstanding Acquiror Expenses) on terms not less favorable in the aggregate to Acquiror than those contained in each Subscription
Agreement that the Alternative Financing would replace from the same or other sources and which do not include any incremental
conditionality to the consummation of such Alternative Financing that are more onerous to Acquiror and the Company (in each case,
in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in each Subscription Agreement (as applicable) in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;immediately notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. Upon receiving such notification,
the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Acquiror in obtaining Alternative Financing.</P>
