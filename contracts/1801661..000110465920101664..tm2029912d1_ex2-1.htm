Article III 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

  



  

3.01   _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement:

  



  

(a)  immediately prior to the Exchange, each share of Company
Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time
shall automatically convert into a number of shares of Company Class B Common
Stock in accordance with the Company Certificate of Incorporation
(collectively, the " _Company Preferred Stock Conversion_ "). All of the
shares of Company Preferred Stock converted into shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities;

  



  

(b)  immediately after the Company Preferred Stock Conversion
and immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Class B
Common Stock that is held by the Founder or any of his controlled Affiliates
that is issued and outstanding as of such time shall automatically convert
into one share of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with an exchange
agreement dated as of the date hereof between the Company and the Founder
and, if applicable, such controlled Affiliates (the " _Exchange_ ");

  



  

(c)  immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
Acquiror Class B Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of such time
(other than the shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock that are being placed
into the Earnout Escrow Account and which are to be released to the
applicable then former holders of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of _Section 3.07_) shall automatically convert in accordance
with the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation into one (1) share of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock (the " _Sponsor Stock Conversion_ "). All of
the shares of Acquiror Class B Common Stock converted into shares of Acquiror
Class A Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of Acquiror Class B Common Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such securities;

  



  

(d)  at the Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
following the Company Preferred Stock Conversion and immediately following
the consummation of the Exchange and the Sponsor Stock Conversion), by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Company Stockholder,
subject to and in consideration of the terms and conditions set forth herein
(including without limitation delivery of the release contemplated by
_Section 3.04(a)(ii)_ ), each share of Company Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive the
following:

  



  

   

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i)  if the holder of such share makes a proper election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") with respect to such share of Company
Common Stock, which election has not been revoked pursuant to _Section 3.03_
(each such share, a " _Cash Electing Share_ "), an amount in cash for such
Cash Electing Share, without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration Value, except that if (x) the sum of the aggregate number of
Dissenting Shares and the aggregate number of Cash Electing Shares,
_multiplied by_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration Value (such product,
the " _Aggregate Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds the Cash Consideration,
then each Cash Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive
(A) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per
Share Merger Consideration Value and (2) a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Cash Consideration and the denominator of which shall be
the Aggregate Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ ")
and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
PubCo's Class A Common Stock (or with respect to a share of Company Class A
Common Stock (including any such share issued following the Exchange)
for which such Cash Election was made, shares of PubCo's Class B Common
Stock) equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration Value
and (2) one minus the Cash Fraction;

  



  

(ii)  if the holder of such share makes a proper election to
receive shares of PubCo's Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") with respect
to such share of Company Common Stock, which election has not been revoked
pursuant to _Section 3.03_ , or the holder of such share fails to make a Cash
Election or Stock Election with respect to such share in accordance with the
procedures set forth on _Section 3.03_ (each such share, a " _Stock Electing
Share_ "), the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, _provided_ , that,
if the Cash Consideration Excess is greater than zero, the aggregate
consideration to be received by such holder pursuant to this _Section
3.01(d)(ii)_ for all of its Stock Electing Shares shall be adjusted in
accordance with _Section 3.01(d)(iii)_ below; and

  



  

(iii)  if the Cash Consideration Excess is greater than zero, then
(A) the Cash Consideration Excess shall be allocated among the Company
Stockholders holding shares of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  _pro rata_ until the
Cash Consideration Excess is reduced to zero; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, no such Company Stockholder
shall be required pursuant to this _Section 3.01(d)(iii)_ to receive cash in
an amount that would result in the Cash Consideration Percentage attributable
to such Company Stockholder (together with its Affiliates) exceeding the
Aggregate Cash Consideration Percentage, and (B) any amounts allocated in
accordance with the preceding sub-clause (A) shall reduce the number of
shares to be received by such Company Stockholder pursuant to _Section
3.01(d)(ii)_ by a number of shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(1) the amount of excess cash received by such Company Stockholder in
accordance with the preceeding sub-clause (A), by (2) the Closing Share
Price. As used in this _Section 3.01(d)(iii)_ , the term " _pro rata_ " shall
mean, with respect to any Company Stockholder holding shares of Company Common
Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
in accordance with the ratio calculated by dividing (x) the sum of the number
of such shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder _by_
(y) the sum of the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock held by
all Company Stockholders.

  



  

   

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
consideration as described in this _Section 3.01(d)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Company Common Stock
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities,
except the right to receive the applicable consideration described in this
_Section 3.01(d)_ into which such share of Company Common Stock shall have
been converted into in the Merger.

  



  

(e)  at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall thereupon be
converted into and become one validly issued fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company
and all such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Company as of immediately following the Effective Time;
and

  



  

(f)  at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Company Capital
Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and no payment or distribution shall be made with
respect thereto.

  



  

3.02   _Equitable Adjustments_. _If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
shares of Company Preferred Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar
event shall have occurred, or if there shall have been any breach of Section
5.15(a) of this Agreement by Acquiror with respect to the number of its
issued and outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock (or any other issued
and outstanding equity security interests in Acquiror) or rights to acquire
Acquiror Common Stock (or any other equity security interests in Acquiror),
then any number, value (including dollar value) or amount contained herein
which is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of
Company Preferred Stock or shares of Acquiror Common Stock (or any other
equity security interests in Acquiror), as applicable, will be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock, the holders of
shares of Company Preferred Stock or the holders of Acquiror Common Stock, as
applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; provided, however, that this Section 3.02 shall not be
construed to permit Acquiror, the Company or Merger Sub to take any action
with respect to their respective securities that is prohibited by the terms
and conditions of this Agreement._

  



  

3.03   _Consideration Election Procedure_.

  



  

(a)  On or prior to the Election Date, each Company Stockholder
entitled to receive consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(d)_ shall be
entitled to specify the number of such holder's shares of Company Capital
Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election or a Stock
Election by complying with the procedures set forth in this  _Section 3.03_ ;
_provided_ , that no Company Stockholder (taken together with its Affiliates),
may make a Cash Election on more than Sixty Three and Five Thousand-Fifty
Seven Ten-Thousandths Percent (63.5057%) of the shares of Company Capital
Stock (as though the Company Preferred Stock Conversion occurred on the
Election Date) held by such Company Stockholder and its Affiliates. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything else to the contrary set forth
herein, (i) each Company Stockholder that is party to a Cash Consideration
Commitment shall be deemed to have validly made a Cash Election for the dollar
amounts specified under such Cash Consideration Commitment, (ii) each Company
Stockholder that is party to a Stock Consideration Commitment shall be deemed
to have validly made a Stock Election for the number of shares Company Capital
Stock specified under such Stock Consideration Commitment, and (iii) each
Cash Election or Stock Election made pursuant to this _Section 3.03_ shall be
deemed to be made with respect to each applicable Company Stockholder on an
"as converted to Company Common Stock" basis.

  



  

   

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  The Company shall mail to each registered holder of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, such registered holders determined
as of the record date for determining the Company Stockholders entitled to
provide the Company Requisite Approval via written consent, a form of election
(the " _Form of Election_ ") with the Consent Solicitation Statement. Each
Company Stockholder entitled to receive consideration pursuant to _Section
3.01(d)_ shall use the Form of Election to make a Cash Election or a Stock
Election. In the event that any such Company Stockholder fails to make a Cash
Election or a Stock Election with respect to any or all shares of
Company Capital Stock held or beneficially owned by such holder, then such
holder shall be automatically deemed to have made a Stock Election with
respect to those shares. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make the Form of Election available to all persons who become
Company Stockholders during the period between the record date for
determining the Company Stockholders entitled to provide Company Requisite
Approval via written consent and the Election Date, and who are entitled to
receive consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(d)_.

  



  

(c)  Any applicable Company Stockholder's election pursuant to
the Form of Election will be deemed properly made only if the Company has
received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on the tenth
(10th) Business Day following the date on which the Form of Elections are
first mailed to the registered holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock (the " _Election Date_ "), a Form of Election duly,
completely and validly executed and accompanied by (A) Company Certificates
to which such Form of Election relates or (B) in the case such shares are
uncertificated, any additional documents required by the procedures set forth
in the Form of Election, and in each case, together with any additional
documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election.
Acquiror and the Company shall publicly announce the Election Date upon the
mailing of the Form of Elections to the registered holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock.

  



  

(d)  Any Cash Election or Stock Election is final and
irrevocable, unless (i) otherwise consented to in writing by the Company
(which such consent may, in the Company's sole discretion, be provided or
denied), or (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Article X_ , in which case all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall
automatically be revoked concurrently with the termination of this Agreement.
Without limiting the application of any other transfer restrictions that may
otherwise exist, after a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly made or
deemed to be made with respect to any shares of Company Capital Stock (or
Company Preferred Stock on an "as converted to Company Common Stock" basis),
no further registration of transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Company until the Closing, unless and until such Cash
Election or Stock Election is validly revoked in accordance with this _Section
3.03_.

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e)  The determination of the Company shall be final, conclusive

3.06   _Treatment of Company Options; Warrants and Company
Restricted Shares_.

  



  

(a)  Effective as of the Effective Time, (i) each option to
purchase shares of the Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") granted
under any Company Group Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Options that are
held by the Founder or his controlled Affiliates), whether or not then vested
or exercisable, shall be assumed by the PubCo and shall be converted into a
stock option (a " _PubCo Option_ ") to acquire shares of PubCo's Class A
Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 3.06(a)_ and (ii) each Company
Option granted under any Company Group Stock Plan that is held by the Founder
or his controlled Affiliates and that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effectve Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by PubCo and shall be converted into
a PubCo Option to acquire shares of PubCo's Class B Common Stock in accordance
with this _Section 3.06(a)_. Each such PubCo Option as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in
the applicable Company Group Stock Plan, in any award agreement or in such
Company Option by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the
Effective Time, each such PubCo Option as so assumed and converted shall be
for that number of shares of PubCo's Class A Common Stock (or PubCo's Class B
Common Stock if such PubCo Option is to be held by the Founder or his
controlled Affilaites) determined by multiplying the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, which product shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares, at a per share exercise price determined
by dividing the per share exercise price of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, which quotient
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent. The Company shall terminate
the Company Group Stock Plans as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective
Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and each holder of
PubCo Options shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Options, except as set forth in this _Section 3.06(a)_.

  



  

   

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  Effective as of the Effective Time, each warrant to
purchase shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Company Warrant_ ") that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not
terminated pursuant to its terms, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the PubCo, the Company or the holder of any such Company
Warrant, shall be converted into a warrant (a " _PubCo Warrant_ ") to acquire
shares of PubCo's Class A Common Stock in accordance with this _Section
3.06(b)_. Each such PubCo Warrant as so assumed and converted shall continue
to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
the Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the
Effective Time, each such PubCo Warrant as so assumed and converted shall be
for that number of shares of PubCo's Class A Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, which product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares, at a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share
exercise price of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, which quotient shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole cent. As of the Effective Time, all Company Warrants shall no
longer be outstanding and each holder of PubCo Warrants shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Company Warrant, except as set forth in this
_Section 3.06(b)_.

  



  

(c)  Effective as of immediately prior to the Company Preferred
Stock Conversion, each unvested restricted share of Company Common Stock and
Series E Preferred (each a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") granted under any
Company Group Stock Plan or otherwise, other than those Company Restricted
Shares set forth on _Schedule 3.06(c)_ , shall, by virtue of the Merger, and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof (or subject to
obtaining the consent of the holder to the extent necessary), become
immediately vested and each such holder of a Company Restricted Share shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable or issuable to
a holder of Company Common Stock or Series E Preferred, as applicable,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, less applicable tax
withholding, if any. In respect of the Company Restricted Shares set forth on
_Schedule 3.06(c),_ as of the Effective Time, each such share of Company
Restricted Stock, to the extent then unvested and outstanding, shall
automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into a number of shares of restricted PubCo's Common
Stock (a " _PubCo 's Restricted Share_") equal to the number of shares of
PubCo's Common Stock issuable as Per Share Merger Consideration in
consideration for one share of such Company Common Stock, rounded to the
nearest whole share of such PubCo's Common Stock.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversions described in
this _Section 3.06_ will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are
required to cause the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Following
the Effective Time, each PubCo Option and PubCo's Restricted Share shall be
subject to the Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan (and considered " _Substitute
Awards_ " for purposes thereof) and to the same terms and conditions,
including, without limitation, any vesting conditions, as had applied to the
corresponding Company Option and Company Restricted Share as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except for such terms rendered inoperative by
reason of the Transactions, subject to such adjustments as reasonably
determined by the PubCo Board to be necessary or appropriate to give effect
to the conversion or the Transactions.

3.11   _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by a holder who is entitled
to demand and has properly demanded appraisal of such shares in accordance
with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, extinguished
and cease to exist and (b) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such
holder's right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable
Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration (as if such share was subject to a Stock
Election) upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice (and in any event within two
Business Days) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and
Acquiror shall have the right to participate in and, following the Effective
Time, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise

to do any of the foregoing.

trust account at UBS Financial Services Inc. (the " _Trust Account_ "),
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York
corporation, acting as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), pursuant to
the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated March 5, 2020, by and

Agreement is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Acquiror and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, the Trustee,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability,
to general principles of equity. The Trust Agreement has not been terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended or supplemented or modified, in any respect,
and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, no such termination, repudiation,
rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated. There are
no side letters and there are no agreements, Contracts, arrangements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with the Trustee or any other Person
that would (i) cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror
SEC Reports to be inaccurate or (ii) entitle any Person (other than any
Acquiror Stockholder who is a Redeeming Stockholder) to any portion of the
proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in
the Trust Account may be released except in accordance with the Trust
Agreement, Acquiror Organizational Documents and Acquiror's final prospectus
dated March 5, 2020. Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United
States Government securities or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. Acquiror has performed all material obligations required to be
performed by it to date under, and is not in material default, breach or
delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in
connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred which, with
due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default or
breach thereunder. There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of
Acquiror, threatened with respect to the Trust Account. Acquiror has not
released any money from the Trust Account (other than interest income earned
on the principal held in the Trust Account as permitted by the Trust
Agreement). As of the Effective Time, the obligations of Acquiror to dissolve
or liquidate pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents shall
terminate, and, as of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall have no obligation
whatsoever pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents to dissolve and
liquidate the assets of Acquiror by reason of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Following the Effective Time, no Acquiror
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account
except to the extent such Acquiror Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder.

(b)  As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by
the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, Acquiror has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to Acquiror on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)  As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not have, or have any
present intention, agreement, arrangement or understanding to enter into or
incur, any obligations with respect to or under any Indebtedness.

  



  

5.09   _Taxes_.

  



  

(a)  All material Tax Returns required by Law to be filed by
Acquiror have been duly and timely filed (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of time in which to make such filings).

  



  

(b)  All material amounts of Taxes shown due on any Tax Returns
of Acquiror and all other material amounts of Taxes owed by Acquiror have
been timely paid.

appropriate Governmental Authority.

  



  

   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(d)  Acquiror is not currently engaged in any material audit,
administrative or judicial proceeding with a taxing authority with respect to
Taxes. Acquiror has not received any written notice from a taxing authority of
a proposed deficiency of a material amount of Taxes, other than any such
deficiencies that have since been resolved. No written claim has been made by
any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where Acquiror does not file a
Tax Return that such entity is or may be subject to Taxes by that
jurisdiction in respect of Taxes that would be the subject of such Tax
Return, which claim has not been resolved. There are no outstanding
agreements extending or waiving the statutory period of limitations
applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection or
assessment or reassessment of, material Taxes of Acquiror, and no written
request for any such waiver or extension is currently pending.

  



  

(e)  To the knowledge of Acquiror, there are no facts,
circumstances or plans that, either alone or in combination, could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Transactions from qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

(f)  Other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 5.06_, this _Section 5.09_ contains the exclusive representations
and warranties of Acquiror with respect to Tax matters. Nothing in this
_Section 5.09_ shall be construed as providing a representation or warranty
with respect to (i) any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning following the Closing Date or (ii) the existence, amount,
expiration date or limitations on (or availability of) any Tax attribute.

  



  

5.10   _Brokers ' Fees_. Except for fees described on  _Schedule
5.10_ (including the amounts owed with respect thereto), no broker, finder,
investment banker or other Person is entitled to any brokerage fee, finders'
fee or other commission (including any deferred underwriting commission) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Equity Financing) or as a result of the Closing, in each case, including
based upon arrangements made by Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, including the Sponsor.

  



  

5.11   _Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_.

  



  

(a)  Acquiror has filed in a timely manner all required
registration statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since the date of
incorporation of the Acquiror (collectively, as they have been amended since
the time of their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Acquiror
SEC Reports_ "). None of the Acquiror SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial
statements (including, in each case, the notes and schedules thereto)
included in the Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly present (subject, in the case of the
unaudited interim financial statements included therein, to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes) in all material respects
the financial position of Acquiror as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then
ended.

(b)  Acquiror has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror and other material information required to
be disclosed by Acquiror in the reports and other documents that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Acquiror's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Acquiror's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in
Acquiror's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c)  Acquiror has established and maintained a system of

credit made by Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7

(e)  Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor
Acquiror's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves Acquiror's management or other employees who have a
role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by Acquiror or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

  



  

(f)  As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC
comments from the SEC with respect to the Acquiror SEC Reports. None of the

complete and correct copies of the executed Subscription Agreements. Except
as set forth in the Subscription Agreements, there are no conditions precedent

arrangements relating to the Equity Financing to which Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates is a party that could impose conditions to the funding of the

satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to be satisfied by it in the
Subscription Agreements at the time it is required to consummate the Closing

altered or amended, nor, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, is any such amendment,
modification, withdrawal, termination or rescission currently contemplated or
the subject of current discussions. None of the commitments under the executed
Subscription Agreements have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded prior to
the date of this Agreement. Subject to its terms and conditions, the Equity
Financing, when funded in accordance with the Subscription Agreements, will
provide Acquiror with acquisition financing proceeds on the Closing Date
sufficient, together with available cash of Acquiror, to consummate the
Transactions. The Subscription Agreements are (or shall be when executed) (as
to Acquiror and to the Knowledge of the Acquiror, the other parties thereto)
valid, binding and in full force and effect and no event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, which would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Acquiror under the terms and conditions of
the Subscription Agreements, other than any such default, breach or failure
that has been irrevocably waived by the applicable Equity Investor
or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Acquiror to the satisfaction of such
Equity Investor. There are no commitment fees or other fees required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements.

memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, confidentiality

Business Days) keep Acquiror reasonably informed of any material developments

reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company whose business constitutes 20%

disposition (including by way of merger, reorganization, division,

Article VII 
 COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR

  



  

7.01   _Subscription Agreements_. Subject to the terms
hereof, Acquiror shall and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with its
obligations, and enforce its rights, under the Subscription
Agreements. Acquiror shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach by
any party to the Subscription Agreements of which Acquiror has become aware
or any termination (or alleged or purported termination) of the Subscription
Agreements. Acquiror shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the proceeds
of the Equity Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the
Subscription Agreements entered into at or prior to the date hereof if such
amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (i) would materially delay the
occurrence of the Closing, (ii) reduces the aggregate amount of the Equity
Financing, (iii) adds or imposes new conditions or amends the existing
conditions to the consummation of the Equity Financing or (iv) is adverse to
the interests of the Company, in each case, in any material respect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to obtain the proceeds from the Equity
Financing shall not relieve Acquiror of its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such Equity
Financing is available. In the event that any portion of the Equity Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in each
Subscription Agreement, regardless of the reason therefor, and such portion of
the Equity Financing is required to fund the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the Closing Date, Acquiror will (i) as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
any then-available Equity Financing and available cash of Acquiror, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the
Outstanding Company Expenses and Outstanding Acquiror Expenses) on terms not
less favorable in the aggregate to Acquiror than those contained in each
Subscription Agreement that the Alternative Financing would replace from the
same or other sources and which do not include any incremental conditionality
to the consummation of such Alternative Financing that are more onerous to
Acquiror and the Company (in each case, in the aggregate) than the conditions
set forth in each Subscription Agreement (as applicable) in effect as of the
date of this Agreement and (ii) immediately notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. Upon receiving such notification, the
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Acquiror in
obtaining Alternative Financing.

modification to be made to, or any waiver (in whole or in part) of, or

default) by any party to the Sponsor Agreement or any Non-
Redemption Agreement of which Acquiror becomes aware of; and (B) the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any other party to

litigation without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Acquiror shall bear all of its costs of investigation and
all of its defense and attorneys' and other professionals' fees related to
such Stockholder Action.

Article VIII 
 JOINT COVENANTS

  



  

8.01   _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any
covenant contained in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , including the
obligations of the Company and Acquiror with respect to the notifications,

supplemented from time to time, and including the Proxy Statement contained
therein, the " _Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the PubCo's Common Stock to be issued
under this Agreement (including the Earnout Shares), which Registration
Statement will also contain the Proxy Statement. Each of Acquiror and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to

Acquiror will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to stockholders of
Acquiror.

  



  

(b)  Each of Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate and
mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), any response to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Registration Statement and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed
in response thereto. If Acquiror or the Company becomes aware that any
information contained in the Registration Statement shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or that the Registration Statement is
required to be amended in order to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such
party shall promptly inform the other parties and (ii) Acquiror, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate and mutually agree
upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) an amendment
or supplement to the Registration Statement. Acquiror and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Proxy Statement
to be disseminated to the holders of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, as
applicable, in each case pursuant to applicable Law and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Acquiror Organizational Documents.
Acquiror shall provide the other parties with copies of any written comments,
and shall inform such other parties of any oral comments, that Acquiror
receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement
promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the other parties
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed written or oral
responses to such comments prior to responding to the SEC or its staff.

  



  

(c)  Acquiror agrees to include provisions in the Proxy
Statement and to take reasonable action related thereto with respect to (i)
approval of the Merger (the " _Transaction Proposal_ "), (ii) approval of the
PubCo Charter (the " _Amendment Proposal_ "), (iii) approval of the issuance
of PubCo's Common Stock in connection with the Transactions
(including pursuant to the consummation of the Subscription Agreements) in

Proposal_ "), (iv) the adoption of the Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "
_Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal_ ") and (v) approval of any other
proposals reasonably necessary or appropriate to consummate the transaction
contemplated hereby (the " _Additional Proposal_ " and together with the
Agreement Proposal, Merger Proposal, Amendment Proposal, Acquiror Omnibus
Incentive Plan Proposal and the Stock Issuance Proposal, the " _Proposals_
"). The Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal shall provide that an
aggregate number of shares of PubCo's Common Stock equal to 10% of the
outstanding shares of PubCo's Common Stock as of Closing _plus_ 15,000,000
shares of PubCo's Common Stock shall be reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Acquiror Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to annual increases as provided

(d)  Acquiror and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to, as promptly as practicable, and in compliance with applicable Law (i)
establish the record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Special Meeting in accordance with the DGCL, (ii) cause the Proxy Statement
to be disseminated to Acquiror's stockholders and (iii) solicit proxies from
the holders of Acquiror _Class A_ Common Stock to vote in favor of each
of the Proposals. Acquiror shall, through the Acquiror Board, recommend to
its stockholders that they approve each of the Proposals (the " _Acquiror
Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include the unqualified Acquiror Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Acquiror Board shall not (and no
committee or subgroup thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, or publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify,
the Acquiror Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 8.02(d)_, if on a date for which the Special Meeting is
scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the Acquiror
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Special Meeting.

  



  

(e)  The Company shall solicit the Company Requisite Approval
via written consent as soon as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement becomes effective. In connection therewith, Acquiror and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) cause
the Consent Solicitation Statement to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law and (iii) solicit written
consents from the Company Stockholders to give the Company Requisite Approval.
The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to the Company
Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Consent Solicitation Statement. The Company Board shall not (and no committee
or subgroup thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or
publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation. The Company will provide Acquiror with copies
of all stockholder consents it receives within one (1) Business Day of receipt
of the Company Requisite Approval. If the Company Requisite Approval is
obtained, then promptly following the receipt of the required written
consents, the Company will prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have
not consented the notice required by Section 228(e) and 262 of the
DGCL. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company's obligation to solicit written consents from the Company
Stockholders to give the Company Requisite Approval in accordance with this
_Section 8.02(e)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Acquisition
Proposal.

intend that the Transactions shall qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment.
None of the parties or their respective Affiliates shall knowingly take or
cause to be taken, or knowingly fail to take or knowingly cause to be failed
to be taken, any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent
qualification for such Intended Tax Treatment. Each party shall, unless
otherwise required by a final determination within the meaning of Section

determination) or a change in applicable Law, or based on a change in the
facts and circumstances underlying the Transactions from the terms described
in this Agreement, cause all Tax Returns to be filed on a basis of treating
the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and the Transactions as a transaction that qualifies under Section 351
of the Code. Each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
promptly notify all other parties of any challenge to the Intended Tax
Treatment by any Governmental Authority.

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
if such announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law or
legal process (including pursuant to the Securities Law or the rules of any
national securities exchange), in which case Acquiror or the Company, as
applicable, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate
such announcement or communication with the other party, prior
to announcement or issuance and allow the other party a reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon (which shall be considered by Acquiror or the

8.06   _Additional Insurance and Indemnity Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Closing, Acquiror and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate in order to obtain directors' and officers' liability
insurance for PubCo and the Company that shall be effective as of Closing and
will cover (i) those Persons who were directors and officers of the Company
prior to the Closing and (ii) those Persons who will be the directors and
officers of PubCo and its Subsidiaries (including the directors and officers
of the Company) at and after the Closing on terms not less favorable than
the better of (a) the terms of the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance in place for the Company's directors and officers and (b) the terms
of a typical directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for a
company whose equity is listed on NYSE or Nasdaq (as applicable) which policy
has a scope and amount of coverage that is reasonably appropriate for a
company of similar characteristics (including the line of business and
revenues) as PubCo and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company).

  



  

(b)  From and after the Effective Time, PubCo and the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director or
officer of the Company, or any other person that may be a director or officer
of the Company prior to the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or threatened
Action or other action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or relating
to the enforcement by any such Person of his or her rights under this _Section
8.06_, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent that the Company, would have been permitted under
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such Person, and shall advance expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses_ of any such Person as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (including, without limitation, in connection with any
action, suit or proceeding brought by any such Person to enforce his or her
rights under this _Section 8.06_). Without limiting the foregoing, PubCo
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i)
maintain for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time
provisions in its certificate of incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and
other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of officers and
directors that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of
such certificates of incorporation (if applicable), bylaws and other
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case,
except as required by Law. PubCo shall assume, and be liable for, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries to honor, each
of the covenants in this _Section 8.06_.

(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 8.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on PubCo and the
Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of PubCo and the Surviving
Company. In the event that PubCo, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person or effects any division

shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of PubCo or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.06_. The obligations of
PubCo and the Surviving Company under this _Section 8.06_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to materially and adversely affect
any present and former director or officer of the Company, or other person
that may be a director or officer of the Company prior to the Effective Time,
to whom this _Section 8.06_ applies without the consent of the affected
Person. The rights of each person entitled to indemnification or advancement
hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights
such Person may have under the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the
bylaws of the Company, any other indemnification arrangement, any applicable
law, rule or regulation or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 8.06_
are expressly intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each Person
entitled to indemnification or advancement hereunder and their respective
successors, heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 8.06._

proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Regulatory Consent Authority

rights, services or businesses of such party, or any interest or interests
therein;  _provided_ , that any such action contemplated by this _Section
8.07(c)_ is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 8.07_ or
any other provision of this Agreement shall require or obligate the Company's
Affiliates and investors, the Acquiror's Affiliates and investors, including
the Sponsor, the Non-Redeeming Stockholders, their respective Affiliates and
any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or

its ability to retain, any business, products, rights, services, licenses,
assets or properties of such Person or entity or any of such entity's
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any interest therein.

the other of any substantive communication with, and furnish to such other

the Company, as applicable, or any of its respective Affiliates and any third
party or Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each of the Acquiror and the Company shall permit
counsel to such other party an opportunity to review in advance, and each of

Agreement; _provided_ that neither Acquiror nor the Company shall extend any
waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act, if applicable, or enter

such other party and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance
notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions, either in
person or by telephone, between such party and/or any of its
Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any materials exchanged in connection with
this _Section 8.07_ may be redacted or withheld as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company or the Acquiror, as applicable, or
other competitively sensitive material; provided, that each of Acquiror and
the Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any materials
provided to such other party under this _Section 8.07_ as "outside counsel
only." Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 8.07_ or any other provision of this Agreement shall require or
obligate the Company or any of its investors or Affiliates to, and Acquiror
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree or
otherwise be required to, take any action with respect to the Company, or

division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or
take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement

Regulatory Consent Authorities or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental

_Section 10.02_, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 10.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no
effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto or its
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or stockholders, other
than liability of any party hereto for any Willful Breach of this Agreement
by such party occurring prior to such termination subject to _Section 6.06_.
The provisions of _Sections 6.06_,  _8.04_ , _10.02_ and _Article XI_

order to give appropriate effect to the Surviving Provisions, shall in each

11.06   _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the Transactions and all claims
or causes of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require or permit the application of Laws of
another jurisdiction.

  



  

11.07   _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This

herein are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All
references herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to

and Exhibits to this Agreement) and that certain Confidentiality Agreement,
dated June 2, 2020, between Acquiror and the Company (the " _Confidentiality

or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the
same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement.
The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the parties shall
not restrict the ability of the board of directors of any of the parties to

11.10_.

11.11   _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein
that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision
giving effect to the intent of the parties.

  



  

11.12   _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if such court declines to exercise jurisdiction, any federal or state
court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction,
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
Action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to
bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained
shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any
manner permitted by Law, or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise
proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to
enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section
11.12_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

11.13   _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01_, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of
the parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section 11.13(a)_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such injunction.

  



  

11.14   _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the Named Parties, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein or in an Ancillary Agreement with respect to
such Named Party. Except to the extent a Named Party to this Agreement or an
Ancillary Agreement and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such Named Party in this Agreement or in the
applicable Ancillary Agreement, (a) no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any
named party to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and (b) no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement of or for any claim based on,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

11.15   _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. Except in the case of Fraud, none of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements in this Agreement or
in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and other
provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time (and there shall be no liability after the
Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those covenants and agreements
contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement that by their terms expressly
apply in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with respect to any
breaches occurring after the Closing, and (b) this _Article XI_.

  



  

11.16   _Stockholder Representative_.

  



  

(a)  Each Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have
irrevocably appointed the Founder as its representative and attorney-in-
fact (in such capacity, the " _Stockholder Representative_ ") to serve as the
Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Company Stockholders with
respect to matters relating to the Earnout Shares, including (i) sending or
receiving notices or communications, (ii) entering into amendments or
providing waivers of this Agreement or other Ancillary Agreements, (iii)
making decisions with respect to the distribution and allocation of the
Stockholder Earnout Shares, (iv) retaining counsel, experts and other agents
(any representatives so retained, the " _Retained Agents_ "), and (v) entering
into any settlement or submitting any dispute relating to the Earnout Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have no
obligation to act. The Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to
any Company Stockholder (or any other Person) with respect to actions taken
or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative. In
the absence of bad faith by the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of any Retained Agents; and the fact that any act was taken or omitted
to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive evidence of
good faith. The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time after giving
30 days' notice to the Company and the Company Stockholders; provided,
however, in the event of the resignation or removal of the Stockholder
Representative, a successor stockholder representative shall be appointed by
the Founder.

  



  

   

 | 93| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  The Stockholder Representative shall be reimbursed by PubCo
for any and all reasonable and documented expenses, disbursements, costs and
advances (including fees and disbursements of Retained Agents) incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in his capacity as such.

  



  

(c)  To the fullest extent permitted by Law, PubCo shall
indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder
Representative harmless against any actions, suits, proceedings, claims,
costs, amounts paid in settlement, liabilities, losses, damages, and other
expenses arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of the Stockholder Representative's duties hereunder.

  



  

(d)  A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Company Stockholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all Company Stockholders. Acquiror
is hereby entitled to rely on all statements, representations and decisions
of the Stockholder Representative and shall have no liability to the Company
Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative in connection with any
actions taken or not taken in reliance on such statements, representations
and decisions of the Stockholder Representative.

  



  

11.17   _Acknowledgments_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
(on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives) that: (i) it has conducted its own
independent investigation of the financial condition, results of operations,
assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the other parties
(and their respective Subsidiaries) and has been afforded satisfactory access
to the books and records, facilities and personnel of the other parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) for purposes of conducting such investigation;
(ii) the Company Representations constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the Acquiror and Merger Sub
Representations constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of Acquiror and Merger Sub; (iv) except for the Company
Representations by the Company, the Acquiror and Merger Sub Representations

makes, or has made, any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to any party hereto (or any party's Affiliates) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including (x)
regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to
disclose, any information, including in the estimates, projections or
forecasts or any other information, document or material provided to or made
available to any party hereto or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the Transactions, including meetings, calls or
correspondence with management of any party hereto (or any party's
Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to the future or historical business,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, prospects, assets
or liabilities of any party hereto (or its Subsidiaries), or the
quality, quantity or condition of any party's or its Subsidiaries' assets)
are specifically disclaimed by all parties hereto and their respective
Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the Representatives and
Affiliates of any party hereto or its Subsidiaries); and (v) each party
hereto and its respective Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives are not relying on and have not relied on, any
representations or warranties in connection with the Transactions or otherwise
except the Company Representations by the Company, the Acquiror and Merger
Sub Representations by Acquiror and Merger Sub and the other
representations expressly made by a Person in the Non-Redemption Agreements,
