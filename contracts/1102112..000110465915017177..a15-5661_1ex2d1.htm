and shall continue to exist as a Delaware corporation with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises continuing unaffected by the
Merger.

 



 

(b) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be those of the Surviving Corporation. The directors and
officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with the
additional director appointed pursuant to Section 5.05, shall be the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until such time as their successors
shall be duly elected and qualified.

 



 

(c) _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in § 259 of the DGCL, including any regulations or rules

otherwise agree to in writing). The Merger provided for herein shall become
effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the
Delaware Secretary, or such later time as may be agreed by the Parties and

being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE 3

 



 

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 



 

3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any Person:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Outstanding Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, " _Shares_ "), excluding Excluded
Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become and be converted into the right to receive 0.5997 of a share (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
without interest thereon. At the Effective Time, all Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of a Share not represented by a
Certificate (a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), other than any Excluded Shares, shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration plus any dividends or distributions to which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.03(c) as well as any
cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.03(d).

 



 

(b) _Outstanding Parent Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock, as issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain issued
and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock held
by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted (" _Excluded Shares_ "), shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the
Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

 



 

3.02 _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders
of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger Consideration
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor). After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

3.03 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit
of the holders of Shares (in each case, other than holders of Excluded
Shares), certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book-entry
form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, deliverable upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 3.03(f)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the transmittal materials, pursuant
to the provisions of this Article III, and after the Effective Time, if
applicable, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock (such amount in cash and certificates for shares of Parent
Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Company shall notify Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time of the
number of Shares and Excluded Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and shall cause

 



      
 

 



 

the Companys transfer agent to deliver to the Exchange Agent on or prior to
the Closing Date a list of the holders of Company Common Stock in a format
that is reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other
than holders of Excluded Shares) notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section 3.03(f)) and instructions for
surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions to include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Book-Entry Shares and to be in such form and have such provisions as Parent
and the Company may reasonably agree). Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable) representing that number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.03(g)) equal
to (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid non-stock
dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender
of the Certificate, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Exchange Agent is presented with the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares and/or all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-
Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such

 



      
 

 



 

whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
but for this Section 3.03(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined
by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of
the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Fund shall be administered by
the Exchange Agent until such time as any unclaimed portion thereof is
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 



 

(h) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse

 



      
 

 



 

stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration, respectively, for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

3.04 __Treatment of Equity Awards__.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Companys 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Company Option to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number
of Shares subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A)
the Equity Award Cashout Price over (B) the exercise price per Share under
such Company Option, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which
has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than
or equal to the Equity Award Cashout Price shall be cancelled at the Effective
Time for no consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Equity Award Cashout Price_ " shall mean the product of (1) the Parent
Average Closing Price and (2) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(b) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit (a " _Company RSU_ ") under the Company Stock Plan, whether vested or

RSU to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject
to such Company RSU and (ii) the Equity Award Cashout Price, less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

 



 

(c) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are, in the
Companys reasonable determination, necessary to effectuate the treatment of
the Company Options and Company RSUs (the " _Company Equity Awards_ ")
pursuant to Section 3.04(a) through 3.04(c). The Company shall take all
actions that are, in the Companys reasonable determination, necessary to
ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Equity Awards.

 



 

3.05 _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock held by the individuals listed on Section 3.05 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent then outstanding and not previously
exercised shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
warrants and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cashout Price
over (B) the exercise price per Share under such warrants, less any applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

letter from, any Regulatory Authority.

 



 

(ii) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been advised by, and Parent

would cause any of the statements in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or that would result in
an omission to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other Party thereof
and to take the necessary steps to correct the Prospectus/Proxy Statement.

 



 

(c) (i) The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

 



 

(A) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
5.06(c)(ii) hereof, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose
or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger (a "
_Company Change of Recommendation_ "); or

 



 

(B) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 5.08 entered into in compliance with Section 5.08) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal
made to the Company.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval
contemplated by this Agreement is obtained, the Company Board may withhold,
withdraw or adversely modify the Company Board Recommendation or approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made to the
Company after the date hereof that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
facilitated in breach of this Agreement, if (A) an unsolicited bona fide
written offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn and the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (B) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would result in a violation of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that no such
Company Change of Recommendation may be made until after (I) at least five (5)
Business Days following Parents receipt of notice from the Company advising
that the Company Board intends to take such action and the basis therefor,
including all necessary information under Section 5.08 and (II) the Company
has negotiated in good faith to permit Parent to modify this Agreement during
such five (5) Business Day period. In determining whether to make a Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other
information provided by Parent in response to such notice. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.06, including with respect to the
notice period referred to in this Section 5.06.

 



 

(d) _Press Releases_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger and this Agreement
and (except with respect to a Company Change of Recommendation, subject to
compliance with Section 5.06(c)) shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided,
however,_ that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but
after such

 



      
 

 



 

consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside
counsel be required by Law or the rules or regulations of NASDAQ or the SEC.
The Company and Parent shall cooperate to develop all public announcement
materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by
the other Party.

 



 

5.07 _Access; Information_. (a) The Parties agree that upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in
each case subject to the requirements that such requests or access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Party, it shall
afford the other Party and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to its books, records
(including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent
auditors), Contracts, properties and personnel and to such other information
as such other Party may reasonably request and, during such period, the
Parties shall furnish to other Party promptly all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that, subject to applicable Laws, it shall cooperate in
good faith with Parent on preparing for the development of mutually agreed
operating issues to be implemented after the Effective Time, which the Parties
agree have priority including assisting in developing and implementing plans
for integration and conversion and other matters affecting branches, customers
and back office operations.

 



 

(c) Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to,
hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.07 in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 30, 2014 (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company.

 



 

(d) No investigation by either Party of the business and affairs of the other
Party or its Subsidiaries shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to such Partys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.08 _Acquisition Proposals_. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors and employees
shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries agents and representatives (including any financial
advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not
to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors and
employees shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its agents and representatives (including any financial advisor,
attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ ,
that nothing contained in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will in no way eliminate or
modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have
under this Agreement; (B) at any time prior, but not after, the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, providing information in response to a
request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting
such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less
restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; or (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions
with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in
clause (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to violate the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The
Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 5.08. The Company agrees that it will notify Parent
promptly, but in no event later than the next succeeding Business Day, if any
such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, any of its representatives, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Parent
informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

5.09 _Certain Policies_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided
that Parent has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its obligations to
effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to
effect the Merger, the Company shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and
regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDBO, CBNC and
applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate owned,
accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be
applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Pacific Western Bank;
_provided, however,_ that unless the modification or changes would otherwise
be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or with regulatory
accounting principles and GAAP, no such modification or change shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an
admission or acknowledgement by the Company that any such modification or
change is appropriate or required or that any financial statement or
information previously provided by the Company was incorrect in any respect.

 



 

5.10 _Regulatory Applications_. (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and
file, or in the case of Parent cause to be filed, all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third parties and/or Governmental Authorities in order to consummate
the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby;
and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Parent
as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof and in any event
within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall
consult with the other on, all written information submitted to any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it shall consult
with the other Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and/or
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall keep the other Party
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
the non-confidential portions of notices or other communications received by
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any third party and/or
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the extent
permitted by Law, providing descriptions of any oral communications from such
Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of Governmental Authorities that would reasonably be likely, in
each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action,
condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to the Company) or a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) require Parent, Pacific Western Bank
or the Surviving Corporation or the surviving bank in the Bank Merger to raise
additional capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic
benefits of the Merger to Parent or the holders of Parent Common Stock
(including the Company stockholders in respect of shares of Parent Common
Stock received by them in the Merger) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of such other Party to any third party and/or
Governmental Authority.

 



 

5.11 _Indemnification; Director s and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent
agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) (each a " _Claim_ "), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent or the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).
Further, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, perform and observe the
obligations of the Company under any agreements in effect as of the date of
this Agreement to indemnify those Persons who are or have at any time been
directors and officers of the Company for their acts and omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as officers or directors.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 5.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent or the Surviving
Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or
the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified
Party if such failure does not materially prejudice Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof; _provided, however_ , that none of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the Indemnified Party
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent; _provided, however,_ that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide that portion of directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of the
Company (as opposed to the portion that serves to reimburse the Company) with
respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, which DandO Insurance
shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous to such officers and directors, as that
coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate
for such six (6)-year period more than 300% of the current amount expended on
an annual basis by the Company to maintain or procure such DandO Insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to
maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance called for by this Section 5.11, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to 300%
of the current annual premium; _provided, further,_ that officers and
directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the Surviving Corporations
insurance

 



      
 

 



 

carrier for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Insurance. In lieu of the
foregoing, Parent shall or, with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company may, purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective
Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 300% of the
current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy has
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to
be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
pursuant to this Section 5.11(c).

 



 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

 



 

5.12 _Benefit Plans_. (a) From the Effective Time through the first
anniversary thereof (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided to each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such employees "
_Continuing Employees_ ") who continues employment with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time: (i) base salary and incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the base salary and incentive compensation opportunities provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) employee
benefits (other than severance benefits) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent; and (iii) other than with respect to the employees of the Company
set forth on Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, severance
payments and benefits that are at a level at least equal to the greater of
those to which a Continuing Employee would be entitled (taking into account
the service crediting provisions of the following sentence and without regard
to any reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid to such
Continuing Employee) under the severance plan or policy of the Company or its
Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, or under the severance plan or policy of Parent or its
Subsidiaries applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of termination, if such Continuing Employee
experiences, at any time during the Continuation Period, a termination of
employment under circumstances that would entitle such Continuing Employee to
severance payments and benefits under such severance plan or policy. Parent
will cause each of its employee benefit and compensation plans to take into
account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit
accrual thereunder, the service of the Continuing Employees with the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including without limitation any predecessor entities)
as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent that such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits for the
same period of service and other than for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of the
last sentence in Section 5.12(a), with respect to each Continuing Employee
(and their beneficiaries) Parent shall cause each disability medical, dental
or health plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which each such Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the
applicable disability medical, dental or health plans of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to commencement of
participation in such Parent plan and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation, evidence of insurability requirement or actively-at-work
requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee and their
beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or
beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous plan prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of a resolution or plan
amendment evidencing that the Companys 401(k) Plan is in the process of being
terminated effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of such
termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. The form and
substance of such resolutions or plan amendment shall be subject to the review
and reasonable and timely approval of Parent. The Company also may take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating the Companys 401(k) Plan as it
determined to be reasonably appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
effectiveness of any such actions may be conditioned on the consummation of
the Merger. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, designate a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan of Parent or one of its Affiliates which
provides benefits substantially similar to those provided under the the
Companys 401(k) Plan (such plan(s), the " _Parent 401(k) Savings Plan_")
that either (i) currently provides for the receipt from Continuing Employees
of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined under Section
402 of the Code), including loans, or (ii) shall be amended prior to the
Effective Time to provide for the receipt from the Continuing Employees of
eligible rollover distributions, including loans. Each Continuing Employee who
is a participant in the Companys 401(k) Plan shall be eligible beginning on
the first day of the month following the Closing Date to commence
participation in the Parent 401(k) Savings Plan as of the Closing Date and
given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance
under the Companys 401(k) Plan and shall be given the opportunity to elect to
"roll over" such account balance (including any outstanding loan) to the
Parent 401(k) Savings Plan.

 



 

(d) Nothing herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Benefit Plan, (ii) limit the ability of Parent to amend or terminate any of
the Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time, (iii) limit the
ability of Parent to retain or terminate the employment of any particular
Continuing Employee or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or its
Subsidiaries or under any benefit plan which Parent or its Subsidiaries may
maintain.

 



      
 

 



 

5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

 



 

5.14 _Third-Party Agreements_. (a) The Parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain (i) the consents or waivers required to be obtained
from any third parties in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (in such form and content as mutually
agreed by the Parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the
cooperation of such third parties (including at Parents request, with respect
to the termination of Contracts following the Effective Time) to effect a
smooth transition in accordance with the Parties timetable at or after the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), each of the Parties
shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item processing
and other processing support or outside contractors to assist in performing
all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data
and other files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parents
production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that a
successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time)
mutually agreed by the Parties, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws
regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition.
Among other things, the Company shall:

 



 

(i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project
plan to effectuate the conversion;

 



 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Companys outside
contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its ongoing
needs until the conversion can be established;

 



 

(iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any
outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested
by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably
practicable;

 



 

(iv) provide reasonable access to the Companys personnel and facilities and,
with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors
personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on
schedule; and

 



 

(v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside data,
item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound when directed to do so by
Parent.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries that is a

 



      
 

 



 

registered investment adviser (each an " _Investment Adviser_ ") to inform
their investment advisory clients of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and request each such clients written consent to the deemed
assignment of its management contract resulting from the change in ownership
of the Company and the relevant Investment Adviser resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and use all reasonable efforts to
obtain such consent on or before the Effective Time. While the Company shall
request affirmative written consents from each Investment Advisers clients to
such deemed assignment, a negative consent will constitute valid consent to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable management contract
if (i) a negative consent is not expressly prohibited by the management
contract (for purposes of this Agreement, it is assumed that, unless an
agreement expressly requires written consent to an "assignment" as defined
under the Investment Advisers Act or a change in control, then such "negative
consent" or "silence" is permissible hereunder and thereunder), (ii) a notice
describing the change in control and the negative consent substantially in
form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company is sent to each client,
and (iii) sixty (60) days elapse from the date that notice is received at the
clients office during which period the client continues to have its account
managed by the applicable Investment Adviser and does not notify the
applicable Investment Adviser that it is withholding its consent.

 



 

(d) Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall
be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business
activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.15 _Closing Financial Statements_. At least eight (8) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall provide Parent with the
Companys consolidated financial statements presenting the financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the last
day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and the
Companys consolidated results of operations for the period from January 1,
2015 through the close of business on the last day of the last month ended
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the " _Closing Financial
Statements_ "); _provided, however_ , that if the Effective Time of the Merger
occurs on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day of the month, the
Company shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and
through the second month preceding the Effective Time of the Merger. Such
financial statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and
regulatory accounting principles and other applicable legal and accounting
requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such
financial statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Companys
chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that
such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of
the certificate, the financial condition of the Company in all material
respects. Such Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for
all Professional Fees incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not
doing so is in accordance with GAAP) and shall be accompanied by a certificate
of the Companys chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to
the effect that such financial statements meet the requirements of this
Section 5.15.

 



 

5.16 _NASDAQ Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ to enable the delisting of the shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the shares of
Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall file with NASDAQ
any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger.

 



 

5.17 _Section 16 Matters_. Each of the Company Board and the Parent Board
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange
Act to exempt the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock into shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees of the Company who may become an
officer or director of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Board shall adopt resolutions that specify (A)

the time period specified therein, the Company shall pay all costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent from the date such
