Parent and the Company shall each be responsible for one-half of the fees and

practicable after the First Effective Time, to the extent not
previously delivered, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, a holder of
record of Company Capital Stock, which shares of Company Capital Stock were
converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section
2.4_ at the First Effective Time, and who has not returned a Stock Letter of
Transmittal and the physical certificates or instruments that immediately
prior to the First Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company
Capital Stock (the "Certificates" and each, a  "Certificate") to the Paying
Agent prior to the Closing Date: (A) a letter of transmittal substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (a "Stock Letter of Transmittal");
and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of such holder's
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.5(e)_) in exchange for payment of the cash consideration set
forth in _Section 2.4_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.5(e)_) to the Paying
Agent, and upon delivery of a Stock Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with
the terms of such Stock Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper
form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration set forth in
_Section 2.4_ for each share of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of such consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Until surrendered or cancelled as contemplated hereby,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in
_Section  2.4_, except for Certificates representing shares of Company
Capital Stock held by holders of Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to
represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL.

  



  

(c)   _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Capital Stock_. At the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock
shall thereafter be made. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to Parent or any Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. From and after the
First Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Capital
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case
of a holder of Company Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ or Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender
such holder's shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this
_Section  2.5_ in exchange for the consideration set forth in _Section 2.4_,
or in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, the right to perfect such
holder's right to receive payment pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(d)   _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any
portion of the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
and Share Consideration made available to the Paying Agent at the Closing that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates on the first anniversary of
the First Effective Time will be returned to Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not prior to
such time provided a duly executed Stock Letter of Transmittal to Parent
and/or has not tendered its Certificates for the consideration set forth in
_Section 2.4_, in each case in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_, shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirements) for delivery of such consideration, without
interest, in respect of such holder's surrender of such holder's Certificates
in compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.5(b)_. Any consideration
remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Companies, the Paying Agent or their
respective Affiliates will be liable to any holder of Certificates for
consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirements. Any portion of the
consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company
Capital Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned
to Parent or an Affiliate thereof designated by Parent upon demand.

  



  

(e)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of a customary affidavit (containing customary indemnification
obligations) of that fact by the holder thereof, the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (subject to the delivery of a
Stock Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ ).

2.6   _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.6_), shares of Company
Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and
held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of
Company Capital Stock, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration set forth in _Section 2.4_. At the
First Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to
exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the
rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the
immediately following sentence. If any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted, as of the First Effective Time, into, and shall represent
only, the right to receive (upon surrender in accordance with _Section 2.5_)
the consideration set forth in _Section 2.4_, without interest.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL (and of any similar demand
purportedly made under other applicable Legal Requirements) and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to any such demands or
offer to settle or settle any such demands other than as required by Legal
Requirements or pursuant to a final court order. Prior to the Closing Date,
any written communication to be made by the Company to any holder of Company
Capital Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and the Company shall consider in good faith any input from Parent
with regards to such written communication.

  



  

2.7   _Treatment of Company Options_.

  



  

(a)  At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the
Company, the Company Optionholders or any other Person, each Vested Company
Option shall be converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration
(as further described in _Sections 2.7(b)_ and _2.7(c)_ ) with respect to
each such Vested Company Option (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if
applicable, amounts distributable to such Company Optionholder in respect of
such Vested Company Option pursuant to Sections _2.9_ , _8.4(a)_ and
_10.10(g)_ ). Each Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option shall
be cancelled as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time and
shall cease to exist (including for all computations required by this
Agreement), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. For
the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option shall, as of the First Effective
Time, cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, whether or not the holder of such Company Option is
entitled to any consideration under this _Section 2.7_.

  



  

(b) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the
Company, the Company Optionholders or any other Person, each Vested Company
Option that is a Vested Substitute Option shall be assumed by Parent and
automatically substituted with a non-qualified stock option (each, a
"Parent Option") to purchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal
to, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Class A Common Stock, (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Vested Substitute Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) a ratio, the numerator of
which is the Common Per Share Amount and the denominator of which is the
Parent Stock Value (such ratio, the "Exchange Ratio"), with each
Parent Option having a per share exercise price equal to, rounded up to the
nearest cent, (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Vested Substitute Option, _divided by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio.
The conversion and substitution of the Vested Substitute Options hereunder is
intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the applicable
regulations thereunder (including Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D))
and, for the avoidance of doubt, each Parent Option shall otherwise continue
to have and be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Vested Substitute Option immediately before the First
Effective Time (including, but not limited to, expiration date and exercise
provisions). The shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the Parent Options
will be granted pursuant to the Stock Plan and are intended to be exempt from
shareholder approval in accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5635(c)(3) and
shall not count against the share reserve under the Stock Plan.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(c)  The Cash Option Consideration payable to the holders of Vested
Cash-Out Options pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ (less (x) the amount, with
respect to the applicable holder, equal to such holder's Pro Rata Share of the
Adjustment Escrow Deposit, (y) the amount, with respect to the applicable
holder, equal to such holder's Pro Rata Share of the Special Escrow Deposit
and (z) the amount, with respect to the applicable holder, equal to such
holder's Pro Rata Share of the Representative Expense Amount, in each case,
pursuant to _Section 3.1_) (in the aggregate, the "Option Cash Amount") shall
be paid (i) in respect of each Vested Cash-Out Option that is an Employee
Option, through the Second Surviving Company's payroll system (or the payroll
system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent), less any required withholding
Taxes in accordance with  _Section 2.10_, no later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date of the Company that is at least five (5) Business Days
following the Second Effective Time, and (ii) in respect of each Vested Cash-
Out Option that is a Non-Employee Option, directly by the Second Surviving
Company (or Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent) within five (5) Business Days
following the Second Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  Prior to the First Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and the Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions reasonably necessary or appropriate, including obtaining any
required consents and providing any required notices (whether under the
Company Equity Plan or otherwise) to effect the transactions described in
this _Section 2.7_, and to ensure that no holder of Company Options shall
have any rights from and after the First Effective Time with respect to any
Company Options to acquire any Company Capital Stock or to receive any
payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously granted under
the Company Equity Plan, except the right to receive a payment with respect
thereto as provided in this _Section 2.7_ and _Section 2.9_, as applicable.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

2.8   _Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment; Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration; Parent Stock_.

  



  

(a)   _Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment_. The Company shall
engage a nationally-recognized or regionally-recognized
independent accounting firm to conduct a physical count of all of the Excess
Capital Equipment within ten (10) days prior to the Closing, which physical
count may be observed by Parent and its accounting advisors if in compliance
with applicable Legal Requirements (including, if applicable, by allowing the
Parent and its accounting advisors to observe by electronic video means). The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Excess Capital Equipment will be
valued in accordance with GAAP, using a lower of cost or market
methodology, which value shall be the "Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment";
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment
exceed $9,639,062. The Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment shall be deemed to
be final and binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2.9_.

  



  

(b) _Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration_. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth (i) the
Company's good faith estimate of (A) the Selling Expenses (the "Estimated
Selling Expenses"), (B) the Closing Indebtedness (the  "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness"), (C) the Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), (D) the
Net Working Capital as of the Measurement Time, (E) the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount as of the Measurement Time (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount"), (F) the MandA Costs and the MandA Adjustment (the
"Estimated MandA Adjustment"), (G) the Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment
determined pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_and (H) the Provider Relief
Adjustment, and based thereon the calculation of the Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration, and (ii) wire instructions for repayment of the
Estimated Selling Expenses described in clause (a) of the definition of
Selling Expenses. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be accompanied by
a schedule showing the Company's reasonably detailed calculation of the items
set forth thereon. The Company shall provide Parent with supporting
documentation reasonably requested and shall afford Parent and its
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
financials, books, and records pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' accountants (subject to the
execution of any access letters that such accountants may reasonably require
in connection with the review of such work papers) and employees, in each case
to the extent reasonably necessary, for Parent to evaluate the Estimated
Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein; _provided_ , that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to
provide information or access to information, materials or persons if doing
so would reasonably be expected to (i) interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the Business, (ii) result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege
or (iii) violate any applicable Legal Requirement. The Company shall consider
in good faith and update the Estimated Closing Statement to reflect any
mutually agreed comments by Parent on such Estimated Closing Statement with
which it agrees (acting in good faith); _provided_ , that the Closing shall
not be delayed if Parent and the Company are unable to agree on any such
comments, and in the case of any such disagreement, the estimated numbers and
calculations proposed by the Company shall be used for purposes of determining
the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration (without limiting any of the
provisions of this Agreement, including _Section 2.9_ ).

  



  

(c)   _Share Consideration_. To determine the type of Share
Consideration received hereunder, the following priority shall be used: first
(A) the holders of Vested Substitute Options shall receive Parent Options to
purchase Class A Common Stock, then (B) each Company Stockholder that is an
Accredited Investor shall be allocated the remaining Common Stock Share
Consideration pro rata based on the number of shares of shares of Company
Common Stock held by each such Company Stockholder (rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock resulting
therefrom for each such Company Stockholder), then (C) each
Company Stockholder shall receive its remaining Share Consideration
(including the incremental portion that was rounded down in clause (B)
hereof) as Series C Preferred Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number
of Class A Common Stock into which such Series C Preferred Stock is
convertible (without taking into account the Share Cap (as defined in the
Certificate of Designations)) for each such Company Stockholder (i.e. rounded
down to the nearest one-hundredth of a share of Series C Preferred Stock)),
and (D) any amounts rounded down in clause (C) shall be paid in cash in an
amount equal to (x) the fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock that
was rounded down, multiplied by (y) the Conversion Rate, multiplied by (z) the
Parent Stock Value.

2.9   _Closing Date Estimates and Post-Closing Reconciliation_.

  



  

(a)  At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the

(vi) the percentage of the Special Escrow Deposit
contributed by each Company Equityholder based on their Pro Rata Share;

(viii)  the percentage of any amount to be paid by Parent
pursuant to _Section __2.9(b)(v)_ payable to each Company Equityholder based
on their Pro Rata Share.

  



  

Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the Closing Consideration
Schedule, and, as between the Common Stockholders, Series C Preferred
Stockholders, and Company Optionholders, on the one hand, and Parent, the
First Surviving Company and the Second Surviving Company, on the other hand,
any amounts delivered by Parent, the First Surviving Company or the Second
Surviving Company to any Common Stockholders, Series C Preferred
Stockholders, Company Optionholders or delivered by Parent to the Paying Agent
for delivery in accordance with the Closing Consideration Schedule in effect
from time to time shall be deemed for all purposes to have been delivered to
the applicable Common Stockholders, Series C Preferred Stockholders, Company
Optionholders in full satisfaction of Parent's obligations under this
_Article II_.

  



  

(b)  Post-Closing Reconciliation.

  



  

(i) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth
Parent's good faith calculation of: (i) the Selling Expenses; (ii) the
Closing Indebtedness; (iii) the Closing Cash; (iv) the Net Working Capital
(as of the Measurement Time); (v) the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(as of the Measurement Time, in a manner consistent with and using only those
specific line items set forth in the Preparation Methodology); (vi) the
MandA Costs and the MandA Adjustment; (vii) the Final Provider Relief Adjustment
and (viii) the Excess Capital Equipment Adjustment determined pursuant
_Section __ 2.8(a)_, and based thereon a calculation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

The Closing Statement and the components thereof (and all calculations of Net
Working Capital, the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Selling Expenses, MandA Costs, the MandA Adjustment,
Final Provider Relief Adjustment and Aggregate Merger Consideration) shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Preparation Methodology,
and the definitions herein, except that the Closing Statement and the
components thereof (and all calculations of Net Working Capital, the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
Selling Expenses, MandA Costs, the MandA Adjustment, Final Provider Relief
Adjustment and Aggregate Merger Consideration) shall: (A) not include any
purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist immediately prior to the Closing and shall
exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the
Closing except to the extent such act, decision or event provides information
about circumstances that existed immediately prior to Closing; and (B) not
reflect, directly or indirectly, any additional reserve or accrual that is not
reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet, except those that (1) result from
material developments occurring after the date of the Latest Balance Sheet but
prior to the Closing or (2) would be required to be reflected on the face of
a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Preparation
Methodology, and the definitions herein. The Parties agree that the purpose
of preparing the Closing Statement and components thereof (and
all calculations of Net Working Capital, the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Selling Expenses, MandA Costs, the
MandA Adjustment, Final Provider Relief Adjustment and Aggregate Merger
Consideration) is solely to assess the accuracy of the amounts depicted in
the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration derived therefrom, and such processes are not intended to
permit the introduction of different accounting methods, policies,
practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations, definitions, principles,
judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation methods with respect to
financial statements, their classification or presentation or otherwise
(including with respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves or level
of accruals) from those used to calculate the amounts set forth in the
Preparation Methodology.

  



  

(ii) During the thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, Parent will provide the Stockholder Representative and
its accountants with reasonable supporting documentation and reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to (x)
review the financial books and records of the Second Surviving Company, any of
Parent's accountants' work papers related to the calculation of amounts
related to the Closing Statement (subject to the execution of any access
letters that such accountants may reasonably require in connection with the
review of such work papers), and (y) the employees and other representatives
of Parent who were responsible for the preparation of the Closing Statement
to respond to questions relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement
and the calculation of the items thereon, in each case solely to allow the
Stockholder Representative to determine the accuracy of Parent's
calculation of the items set forth on the Closing Statement. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to provide information
or access to information, materials or persons if doing so would reasonably be
expected to (i) interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business, (ii)
result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or the disclosure of
any trade secrets or (iii) violate any applicable Legal Requirement. If the
Stockholder Representative disagrees with any of Parent's calculations set
forth in the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative may, within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a written
notice (the "Objection Notice") to Parent disagreeing with such calculations.
Any Objection Notice shall specify those items or amounts with which the
Stockholder Representative disagrees, together with a reasonably detailed
written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or
amount, and shall set forth the Stockholder Representative's calculation,
based on such objections, of the Selling Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness,
the Closing Cash, the Net Working Capital as of the Measurement Time and the
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as of the Measurement Time, the MandA
Costs and the MandA Adjustments, the Excess Capital Adjustment determined
pursuant to _Section __2.8(a)_ , the Final Provider Relief Adjustment, and
based thereon a calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration. To the
extent not set forth in the Objection Notice, the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to have agreed with Parent's calculation of all other items
and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and such amounts shall be final
and binding on the parties. If the Stockholder Representative does not
deliver an Objection Notice within such thirty-day period, then the amounts
set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final and binding on
the parties.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(iii) If an Objection Notice is timely delivered pursuant
to _Section __2.9(b)(ii)_ , the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall,
during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their reasonable best
efforts to reach agreement on the value of the disputed items or amounts. If,
during such period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent are unable to
reach agreement on all disputed items, they shall promptly thereafter mutually
engage and submit such dispute to a nationally-recognized or regionally-
recognized independent accounting firm as is mutually agreed to by Parent and
the Stockholder Representative (the "Independent Accounting Firm") for final
and binding resolution. The Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall consider
only those items or amounts disputed by the Stockholder Representative in the
Objection Notice which remain in dispute; (ii) shall not assign a value to any
item or amount in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item or
amount assigned by the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent,
on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item or amount
assigned by the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on
the other hand; and (iii) shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The
Independent Accounting Firm's determination will be based solely on
presentations by the Stockholder Representative and Parent which are in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(i.e., not on the basis of independent review) and the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to deliver to the Stockholder Representative and Parent as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days of its retention) a
written report setting forth its determination of the amounts in dispute.
Such report shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of such review
and report shall be borne (and paid) by the Stockholder Representative
(solely on behalf of the Company Equityholders, in accordance with the
percentages contributed to the Adjustment Escrow Amount set forth on the
Closing Consideration Schedule (which may for convenience be paid by the
Stockholder Representative out of the Representative Expense Amount)), on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if closing accounts receivable
is the only disputed item, and Parent claims that closing accounts receivable
is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Stockholder Representative,
and the Stockholder Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by
Parent, and if the independent accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the cost of such review
and report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 divided by 500) to the
Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Equityholders)
and 40% (i.e., 200 divided by 500) to Parent.

  



  

   

27

 



    



   



  

(iv)  If the Aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section __2.9_ , is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days of the
final determination of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver
to Parent the amount of such difference (the "Shortfall Amount") from the
Adjustment Escrow Account. In the event that the funds available in the
Adjustment Escrow Account are in excess of the Shortfall Amount (such excess,
the "Escrow Excess Amount"), Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall,
in the same joint written instruction described in the preceding sentence,
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Escrow Excess Amount (i) to the Paying
Agent, for further distribution to the Company Equityholders (other than
holders of Vested Company Options that are Employee Options) and (ii) to the
Parent for further distribution to the holders of Vested Company Options that
are Employee Options on the next regularly scheduled payment date, through the
payroll system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax
withholding, in each case based on percentages specified on the Closing
Consideration Schedule. The Company Equityholders shall not have any liability
for any amount due pursuant to this  _Section __2.9(b)(v)_ except to the
extent of the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow Account.

  



  

(v)  If the Aggregate Merger Consideration, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section __2.9_ , is greater than the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then (A) the amount of such excess shall be
paid in cash by Parent (1) within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the Aggregate Merger Consideration to the Paying Agent, for
further distribution to the Company Equityholders (other than holders of
Vested Company Options that are Employee Options) and (2) on the next
regularly scheduled payment date to the holders of Vested Company Options
that are Employee Options, through the payroll system of Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax withholding, in each case,
based on the Pro Rata Share of each such Company Equityholder, and (B) Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall, within five (5) Business Days of the
final determination of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay the amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account (1) to
the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Company Equityholders
(other than holders of Vested Company Options that are Employee Options) and
(2) to the Parent for further distribution to the holders of Vested Company
Options that are Employee Options on the next regularly scheduled payment
date, through the payroll system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject
to applicable Tax withholding, in each case, based on the Pro Rata Share of
each such Company Equityholder. Parent shall not have any liability for any
amount due pursuant to this _Section __2.9(b)(v)_ in excess of an amount equal
to the Adjustment Escrow Deposit.

  



  

(vi)  Any payment(s) made pursuant to this _Section __2.9_
shall be deemed, for Tax purposes, to be an adjustment to the cash
consideration payable to the Company Equityholders in consideration for the
First Merger.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

2.10   _Withholding_. Merger Sub, Parent, the First Surviving Company,
the Second Surviving Company and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations or under any applicable Tax Legal Requirement;
_provided_ , _however_ , assuming the Company complies with its obligations
under _Section 2.3(a)(v)_, if either the Merger Sub, Parent, the First
Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, determines that it is obligated to deduct or withhold any amounts
from any non-compensatory consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (other than in respect of backup
withholding), such Person shall (i) provide such payee with prior
written notice of its intent to deduct and withhold (together with
information setting forth the amount and reason for such deduction
or withholding), and (ii) afford such payee a reasonable opportunity to
reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by
Merger Sub, Parent, the First Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company
or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, any compensatory payments for Tax purposes payable pursuant to or
as contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid through the Second Surviving
Company's payroll system (or a payroll system of Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent) subject to applicable Tax withholding. For the avoidance of doubt,
any such amount withheld shall reduce the cash consideration payable to such
Company Equityholder regardless of whether the withholding is in respect of
cash or equity consideration payable hereunder.

  



  

2.11  [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

  



  

2.12   _Second Merger Conversion of Securities_. At the Second
Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, the First Surviving Company or Merger Sub II:

  



  

(a)  Each share of common stock of Merger Sub II issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist.

  



  

(b)  Each share of common stock of the First Surviving Company
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall
be converted into one share of common stock of the Second Surviving Company.

  



  

2.13 _Equitable Adjustments._ If at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date any change in the outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, any number or amount contained in this Agreement which is
based on the price or the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or
Preferred Stock of Parent shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary
to provide the Parties the same economic effect with respect to such shares
of capital stock as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon.

ARTICLE III 
 ESCROW AND REPRESENTATIVE EXPENSE AMOUNT

  



  

3.1   _Escrow Deposit; Disbursements_.

  



  

(a)  At the Closing, pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(iii)_, Parent
shall deliver the Adjustment Escrow Deposit and the Special Escrow Deposit to
the Escrow Agent to be, in separate and segregated accounts, held,
safeguarded, invested and released pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. Parent and the Company (as a Selling Expense) shall
each be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses of the Escrow

(ii)  the audited, consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows

Date"), and the related consolidated income statements and statement of cash
flows for the nine-month period then ended (the "Interim Company Financial
Statements").

  



  

(b)  Except as set forth on _Section 4.9(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Company Financial Statements have been prepared from the books
and records of the Company in all material respects and in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied throughout the period, subject, in the case of the
Interim Company Financial Statements, to the absence of explanatory footnote

the financial position and results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the respective dates and for the respective periods described

(c)  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has established
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances for a company of its size and private ownership that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, and provide reasonable assurance regarding
the prevention or timely detection of fraud. Since December 31, 2016, no
officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
refused to execute any certification of any nature whatsoever required by
Legal Requirement or requested by any accounting, banking, financial or legal
firm or entity.

  



  

(d) Since the Latest Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any obligation or liability (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than any such liabilities
or obligations (i) incurred or arising (A) in the Ordinary Course of Business
(including pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is party but excluding any obligation or Liability arising out
of any breach thereof), or (B) in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) disclosed, reflected or reserved
against in the Latest Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto; (iii) taken into
account in the calculation of Selling Expenses, Closing Indebtedness or Net

of Business, except for obsolete items and items of below-standard quality,

Subsidiaries holds any inventory or other goods pursuant to any consignment

Adverse Effect, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted business
in the Ordinary Course of Business and in substantially the same manner
as conducted during the period covered by the Company Financial Statements,
and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have not taken or omitted to take
any action that, if taken after the date hereof, would require the consent of
Parent under _Section 6.1_.

  



  

4.11   _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Section  4.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of each material Employee Plan (excluding employment
agreements and offer letters that (x) do not materially differ from a form
agreement provided, (y) provide for employment "at-will" and do not include
for any severance or other company-paid post-termination obligations, and (z)
provide for annual base salary in the aggregate of less than $150,000).
With respect to each Employee Plan required to be scheduled on _Section
4.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has delivered a true and
complete copy, to the extent applicable, of: (i) each current writing
constituting a part of such Employee Plan and all amendments thereto, and if
unwritten, a written description of such Employee Plan; (ii) the most recent
annual report and accompanying schedules; (iii) the current summary plan
description and any summaries of material modifications; (iv) the most recent
annual financial and actuarial reports; (v) the most recent determination or
opinion letter received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the
IRS regarding the tax-qualified status of such Employee Plan; (vi) the most
recent written results of all required compliance testing; and (vii) copies of
any material, correspondence with the IRS, Department of Labor or other
Governmental Entity since December 31, 2016. There has been no amendment to,
announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan which would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of
the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.

  



  

(b)  Each Employee Plan (and each related trust, insurance
contract or fund) has been established, administered and funded in accordance
in all material respects with its express terms, and in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, including ERISA and
the Code. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
actions, claims or lawsuits against or relating to the Employee Plans, the
assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of the Employee Plans with respect to
the operation of such plans (other than routine benefits claims). Neither the
Company, its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any "party in
interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to an Employee Plan has
engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) has
breached any fiduciary duty with respect to an Employee Plan or otherwise has
any liability in connection with acts taken (or the failure to act) with
respect to the administration or investment of the assets of any
Employee Plan. To the Knowledge of the Company no Employee Plan is presently
under audit or examination (nor has written notice been received of a
potential audit or examination) by any Governmental Entity. All payments
required to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or with
respect to, any Employee Plan (including all contributions, distributions,
reimbursements, premium payments or intercompany charges) with respect to all
prior periods since December 31, 2016 have been timely made or, for any
such payments that are not yet due, properly accrued and reflected in the
most recent consolidated balance sheet prior to the date hereof, in each case
in accordance with the provisions of each of the Employee Plans, applicable
Legal Requirements and GAAP. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist
that could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with
respect to an Employee Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code.

  



  

   

42

 



    



   



  

(c)  With respect to each Employee Plan that is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, such plan, and its related trust,
has at all times since its adoption been so qualified and has received a
current determination letter (or is the subject of a current opinion or
advisory letter in the case of any prototype plan) from the IRS on which the
Company and its Subsidiaries can rely that it is so qualified and that its
trust is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred with respect to the operation of any such plan which would cause the
loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material
liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. No stock or other
securities issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries forms or has
formed any part of the assets of any Employee Plan that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  



  

(d) No Employee Plan is, and none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company or its Subsidiaries
have ever sponsored, established, maintained, contributed to or been required
to contribute to, or in any way has any liability (whether on account of an
ERISA Affiliate or otherwise), directly or indirectly, with respect to any
plan that is, (i) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412,
430 or 4971 of the Code or a "defined benefit" plan within the meaning of
Section 414(j) of the Code or Section 3(35) of ERISA (whether or not
subject thereto), (ii) a Multiemployer Plan, (iii) a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, (iv) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), or (v) a plan maintained
in connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. None
of the Company or its Subsidiaries has withdrawn at any time within the
preceding six years from any Multiemployer Plan, or incurred any withdrawal
liability which remains unsatisfied, and no events have occurred and
no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in any
such liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e)  No event has occurred and no condition exists that would
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of their affiliation
with any ERISA Affiliate to any (i) Tax, penalty, fine, (ii) lien, or (iii)
other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Legal
Requirements, in each case, in respect of any employee benefit plan
maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by
any ERISA Affiliate (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries).

  



  

   

43

 



    



  

(f)  Each Employee Plan that is subject to Affordable Care Act
has been established, maintained and administered in compliance in all
material respects with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including
all notice and coverage requirements, and the Company, its Subsidiaries and
each ERISA Affiliate offer minimum essential health coverage, satisfying the
affordability and minimum value requirements, to their full time employees
(as defined by the Affordable Care Act) sufficient to prevent liability for
assessable payments under Section 4980H of the Code. None of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has attempted to maintain the grandfathered heath plan
status under the Affordable Care Act of any Employee Plan. None of the
Employee Plans provide medical, health, life or other welfare benefits for
former employees or for present employees after termination of employment,
except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of
ERISA, any other applicable Legal Requirement or at the sole expense of the
participant or the participant's beneficiary. No Employee Plan is a self-
insured arrangement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or funded
through a trust and no event has occurred and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in a material increase in the premium costs
of any Employee Plans that are fully-insured. None of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has incurred (whether or not assessed), or is reasonably
expected to incur or to be subject to, any Tax or other penalty with respect
to the reporting requirements under Sections 6055 and 6056 of the Code, as
applicable, or under Section 4980B, 4980D or 4980H of the Code.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.14(g)_ , neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination
with another event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the
amount of any compensation or benefits due, to any current or former employee,
officer, director or other individual service provider of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Employee Plan; (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Plan; (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of (other than Company
Options) any such compensation or benefits, or the forgiveness of indebtedness
of any current or former employee, officer, director or other individual
service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) result in
an obligation to fund or otherwise set aside assets to secure to any extent
any of the obligations under any Employee Plan. No person is entitled to
receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment)
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of
the excise taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any taxes required
by Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(h)  After giving effect to the Section 280G Approval pursuant
to _Section 6.9_ below, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either
alone or in combination with another event) result in any payment or benefit
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that would, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code).

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

(i)  Each Employee Plan which constitutes a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
complies, and has at all relevant times complied, with the operational and
documentary requirements of Section 409A in all material respects.

  



  

(j)  No Employee Plan covers any employees, officers,
directors or other individual service providers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries residing or working outside of the United States.

5.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to Company a true, correct
and complete copy of the fully executed debt commitment letter(s) and the
fee letter(s), dated as of the date hereof (the "Debt Financing Commitment")
(in the case of the fee letter(s), redacted form removing commercially
sensitive information therein, including the fee information and  "flex"
provisions), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed to
Parent and/or its Affiliates, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth
therein for the purpose, among others, of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses to be incurred
by Parent and/or its Affiliates in connection therewith and for the other
purposes set forth therein (the  "Debt Financing", which may also include
certain actions to be taken under and in connection with the Existing Credit
Agreement). As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment is valid and
in full force and effect, has not been amended, modified or waived, no such
amendment, modification or waiver is pending or contemplated (except
for amendments to add additional financing sources thereto in accordance with
the Debt Financing Commitment), and the Debt Financing Commitment has not
been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent has fully paid
or caused to be fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment that are payable
on or prior to the date hereof. The Debt Financing Commitment, in the form so
delivered, is a valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except
as enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. Assuming
the truth and correctness in all material respects of the Company's
representations and warranties made hereunder, as of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other parties thereto, under the Debt Financing Commitment, or a
failure of any condition to the Debt Financing or otherwise result in any
portion of the Debt Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. Assuming
the truth and correctness of the Company's representations and warranties
hereunder, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will fail to timely be
satisfied or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will be unavailable
on the Closing Date (taking into account the Marketing Period). As of
the date of this Agreement, Parent is not aware of any fact, event or other
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Parent in
the Debt Financing Commitment misleading or inaccurate in any material
respect. The Debt Financing Commitment is not subject to any conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder (including with respect
to the Debt Financing Commitment, pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the
related fee letter) to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available
to Parent at the Closing other than as set forth therein (including the
payment of customary fees). The Debt Financing (both before and after giving
effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment),
will be sufficient for Parent to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration (
_less_ the Aggregate Parent Stock Value and _less_ the Aggregate Exercise
Price), the Payoff Amount and the Selling Expenses.

term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) connected with Parent
in any capacity at the time of sale is subject to any of the "Bad

Subsidiaries (nor any predecessor of any such Person) has waived any statute

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Closing, and the failure of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action prohibited by this
_Section 6.1_ shall not be a breach of this _Section 6.1_ or any

foregoing, the Company shall have the right to effect a dividend

contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from taking or failing to take any action, including
the establishment of any policy, procedure or protocol, in each case, in
response to COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measure, and none of the foregoing shall
be deemed to violate or breach this _Section 6.1_ in any way, be deemed to
constitute an action taken outside of the Ordinary Course of Business or
serve as a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)_ for a breach of this _Section 6.1_ or assert that the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) has not been satisfied due to a breach
of this Section 6.1; _provided_ , that in each case, such action or failure to
act is (x) taken or not taken, as applicable, in good faith, and (y)
reasonable (as determined by the Company in good faith after
consultation with Parent unless such consultation is not practicable).

  



  

(b)  From the date hereof through the earlier of the date this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Closing, except
as otherwise expressly permitted, required or contemplated by this Agreement,
or pursuant to any Legal Requirement (including any COVID-19 Measures),
Parent shall not, and it shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, do any
of the following (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise herein or
as consented to in advance in writing by the Company):

  



  

(i) amend, alter, repeal or otherwise modify (whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise) any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation in a manner that would adversely effect the powers,
preferences, rights or privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock or the
Company Equityholder's investment therein; or

  



  

(ii) declare, set aside or pay any cash or non-cash
dividends or make any cash or other non-cash distributions with respect to any
of its equity interests (other than with respect to equity interests held by

6.2 _Public Announcements_. The Parties agree that at all times no
Party hereto shall issue or make, and each Party shall cause its Affiliates
and representatives not to issue or make, any press releases or public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party
hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirement or the
rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or
other Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject or submits,
in which case the Party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. Each Party hereto will also obtain the prior written approval by the
other Party hereto of any press release to be issued announcing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prevent: (a) disclosures by
Parent or the Stockholder Representative or the Company's material
stockholders (i) to their members, holders of its equity securities, limited
partners and Affiliates and (ii) in connection with any private equity,
investment or similar fundraising activities by the direct or indirect,
holders of their equity securities or Affiliates, in each case so long as the
recipients of such disclosure are bound by customary confidentiality
obligations; (b) disclosures by a Party to its respective legal counsel,
accountants, financial advisors or other advisors providing legal, tax,
accounting, estate planning or investment advice; (c) customary post-closing
tombstone announcements that do not include price or other transaction terms;
and (d) disclosures as are required to comply with the obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents. Without the prior written
consent of Parent not to be unreasonably withheld, between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to not, make any broad-based announcements or disclosures
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby to any customers, suppliers or
other business partners of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of Parent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

6.3   _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification now existing in favor of the Covered Persons, as provided in
the Charter Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise in
effect as of the date hereof with respect to any matters occurring prior to
the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force
and effect for the six-year period beginning on the Closing Date, and that
the Company will perform and discharge its obligations to provide such
indemnity and exculpation after the Closing. To the fullest extent required
by the Charter Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof or other applicable agreements as of the date hereof set
forth on _Section 6.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, such indemnification
shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and Parent shall cause the Company
to advance expenses in connection with such indemnification. For a period of
six (6) years after the Closing, and at all times subject to applicable Legal
Requirements, Parent will not (and will not cause or permit the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) cancel,
terminate, amend or otherwise modify in any way adverse to the Covered
Persons, or to the other beneficiaries thereof the exculpation and
indemnification provisions set forth in the Charter Documents of the Company
or its Subsidiaries with respect to time periods at or prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, the Company will purchase a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
covering the Covered Persons effective as of the Closing, and the premium, and
any other costs, for such policy will be borne 50% by the Company (as a
Selling Expense) and 50% by Parent (the "Tail Policy"); _provided_ , 
_however_ , in no event shall Parent be required to pay in excess of 200% of
the premiums paid as of the date hereof by or on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof. From and after the Closing, Parent will (and/or will cause the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates, as applicable, to) comply with
the terms of any such insurance procured pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_,
and will not cancel (or permit to be canceled) or take (or cause to be taken)
any other action or omission that would reasonably be expected to result in
the cancellation, termination, amendment or modification thereof.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(c)  If Parent, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns proposes to (i) consolidate with or merge into
any other Person and Parent or the Company will not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision will be made prior to or
concurrently with the consummation of such transaction so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will assume the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this _Section 6.3_.

  



  

(d)   The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ will survive the
Closing and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Covered Person and his or her successors, heirs and
representatives and will be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent
and the Company and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Contract or otherwise.

  



  

6.4   _Pre-Closing Access_. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
or the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit
Parent and its representatives (including Debt Financing Sources) to have
reasonable access (at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during
regular business hours) to the books, records (including Tax records),
employees, representatives, Contracts, financial and operating data and
information and documents pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent or its representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , that in
exercising access rights under this _Section 6.4_, Parent shall not be
permitted to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or to unreasonably jeopardize the health and
safety of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in light of
COVID-19 ( _provided_ , that if not in violation of any applicable Legal
Requirements, reasonable accommodations shall be made to provide such
information by other means, including electronic video means); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company, after consultation with legal counsel, would reasonably be
expected to result in (i) the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or other competitively sensitive information, (ii) the waiver or
jeopardizing of any information that is the subject to any
applicable confidentiality restrictions or of any applicable attorney-client,
attorney work product or other privilege, or (iii) the violation of any
applicable Legal Requirement (including any COVID-19 Measures). The Parties
will, to the extent legally permissible and practicable, provide notice to
the other Party and make appropriate substitute arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. None
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person(s) makes any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any)
provided pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, and none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries may rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case,
other than to the extent expressly provided in the representations and
warranties expressly and specifically set forth in ___ARTICLE IV_ , as
qualified by the Schedules.

6.5   _Regulatory and Other Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at its
own expense, except as may be provided elsewhere in this Agreement) to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, and consents from Governmental Entities and any other Person and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action,
objection or Legal Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or any other
Person, (ii) defend any Legal Proceedings challenging this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including seeking to have vacated or reversed

or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,

other Transaction Document in accordance with their respective terms and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement and any other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and (v) deliver all required notices and
obtain all required consents, waivers or approvals, in each case under any
contracts with third parties.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall (i) make or cause to be made all filings
required of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document as promptly as practicable and, in
any event, within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to comply at the earliest practicable date
with any request under the HSR Act for additional information, documents, or
other materials received by each of them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") or the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") in respect
of such filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in
connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing Party prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection
with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. Each such Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other Party all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Legal
Requirement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  Each such Party shall promptly inform the other Party hereto of
any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or
any such transaction. No Party hereto shall independently initiate or
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other Party hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, the Parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto relating to proceedings with
any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Parties shall not
be required to share copies of filings made under the HSR Act.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(c) Subject to _Section 6.5(d)_ , each of Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other Legal Requirements or Orders that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws").
Subject to _Section 6.5(d)_ , each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 6.5(d)_ , in connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts
to take promptly any and all actions and steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity, so as to enable the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including
this _Section 6.5_ and the "reasonable best efforts" standard, nothing in
this Agreement shall require Parent or the Company to take or refrain from
taking or to agree to it or its Affiliates taking or refraining from taking
any action, or to suffer to exist any restriction, condition or
requirement: (A) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED], (B) that requires the taking of any
action, including an amendment of any Transaction Document or the sale,
lease, license, disposal or holding separate by the Business or Parent or any
of its Affiliates of any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories
of assets or business or other operations or interests therein that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, adversely affect in any material manner the
economic benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent or the Company
Equityholders under the Transaction Documents or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder, (C) that requires
Parent, the Company Equityholders or any of their respective Affiliates to
terminate existing relationships, ventures or arrangements or alter any
agreement, change any agreement or enter into any agreement (including without
limitation any direct or indirect guarantee, capital maintenance agreement,
keep-well or other requirement to fund money into the Company or its
Subsidiaries), in each such case, that materially alters or changes or has or
would have the effect of changing or altering the economic benefits derived
or expected to be derived by Parent or the Company Equityholders and their
respective Affiliates under the Transaction Documents, (D) would, or would
reasonably be expected to, materially adversely affect the ability of
Parent and its Affiliates, as the case may be, to conduct its business in the
same manner as such business is being conducted, including by materially
adversely limiting its freedom of action or require the sale, lease, license,
disposal or holding separate of any material assets, rights, product lines,
licenses, categories of assets or business or other operations or interests
therein or (E) would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Business
(each of the conditions or restrictions described in clauses (A), (B), (C),
(D) or (E) above, as applied to Parent (and not the Company Equityholders), a
" _Parent Burdensome Condition "_, and each of the conditions or restrictions
described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, as applied to the Company
Equityholders (and not Parent), a " _Company Burdensome Condition "_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
require Parent to agree to, or take, any action in connection with _Section
6.5_ unless such agreement or action is conditioned upon the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein. For the purposes of this _Section
6.5(d)_ , the term "material", "materially" or "material adverse effect"
shall be deemed to be based on the size the Company and Parent, after taking
into account the Closing, on a combined and consolidated basis.

  



   

72

 



    

   



  

(e) Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and the Company shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging
or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets or
Equity Interests of, or by any other manner, any person or portion thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of
a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (x) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, under any
Antitrust Laws, (y) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (z) delay the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the restrictions set forth herein, the Parties and their
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to enter in and consummate the MandA Purchases
(with respect to the Company) and acquisitions of any Person, division or
line of business set forth on _Section 6.5(e)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
(with respect to Parent).

  



  

6.6   _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the satisfaction, but not the waiver, of the closing conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ ). Each Party shall promptly notify the other
Party of (i) the existence of any event or circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of the other
Parties to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Documents not to be satisfied or (ii) the failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which could
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of the
other Parties to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied.

  



  

6.7 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access_. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Company to, preserve and keep the books and records held
by them (including Tax records) relating to the respective businesses of each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Closing Date (or longer if required by Legal
Requirements) and shall make such records (or copies) and officers,
management, employees, advisors and representatives available, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable advance notice, to the Stockholder Representative,
as may be reasonably required by such Person in connection with any insurance
claims by, Legal Proceedings or Tax audits against, investigations of
Governmental Entities of, compliance with Legal Requirements by, or the
preparation of financial statements of, the equityholders (as of the date
hereof) of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that in exercising access rights under this _Section 6.7_, such Persons shall
not be permitted to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business
or to unreasonably jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in light of COVID-19 ( _provided_ , that if
not in violation of any applicable Legal Requirements, reasonable
accommodations shall be made to provide such information by other
means, including electronic video means); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require Parent or the Company to make available any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of Parent, after consultation
with legal counsel, would reasonably be expected to result in (i) the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties, (ii) the waiver
or jeopardizing of any applicable confidentiality restrictions or of any
applicable attorney-client or attorney work product privilege, or (iii) the
violation of any applicable Legal Requirement. The Parties will, to the
extent legally permissible and practicable, make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. In the event that Parent or the Company intends to destroy,
alter or otherwise dispose of any such books and records following the
expiration of such six-year period, Parent must first provide reasonable prior
notice of such intended destruction to the Stockholder Representative and
provide the Stockholder Representative the opportunity to instead retrieve
and/or copy such books and records from Parent.

6.8   _Post-Closing Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)  With respect to each Person who is an active employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (a
"Continuing Employee"), for the period beginning on the Closing Date, and
ending on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, or, in each case, if
earlier, on the date of the termination of employment of the relevant
Continuing Employee (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide each
such Continuing Employee, with (i) a base salary or base wage rate that is no
less than the base salary or base wage rate provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, (ii)
annual cash based target incentive compensation and commission
opportunities that are comparable in the aggregate to the and annual cash
based target incentive compensation and commission opportunities afforded to
such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and (iii) employee retirement, health and welfare benefits (but
specifically excluding any defined benefit plan benefits, retiree health or
welfare benefits, equity based compensation or benefits or long-term
incentive compensation), in each case, as determined by Parent after taking
into consideration the employee retirement, health and welfare benefits that
are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Affiliates.

  



  

(b) During the Continuation Period, for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting and, with respect to the determination of the level
or amount of vacation pay and benefits only, benefit accrual under the benefit
and compensation plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent and
its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing (the "Parent Plans"), Parent shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, credit each Continuing Employee with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service under any substantially similar Employee Plan, except
that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide credit for
service prior to the Closing (i) where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits, (ii) for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension or similar plan or any nonqualified deferred compensation plan, (iii)
for purposes of any retiree health or welfare plan, or (iv) where prior
service is not recognized for similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing Employee to be eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans that are
group health plans to the extent coverage under such Parent Plan replaces
coverage under a substantially similar Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before such replacement to extent such
waiting time was met under such Employee Plan. For purposes of each Parent
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
such requirements were met or not applicable under the corresponding Employee
Plan.

(c)  The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section
6.8_ shall constitute or be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period
of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Company (or any of their
Affiliates) to terminate, any Continuing Employee, other employee or other
service provider for any reason, (ii) confer upon any Person (including any
current or former director, officer or employee of, or consultant or
independent contractor to, Parent or the Company) any third party
beneficiary or other rights or remedies, (iii) establish, amend or modify any
Parent Plan, Employee Plan, or any or any other "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Company, the Parent,
or any of their respective Affiliates, or (iv) alter or limit the ability of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Parent Plan,
Employee Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Closing Date.

  



  

6.9 _Section 280G_. To the extent necessary to avoid the
application of Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
regulations thereunder, (i) during the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending on the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall request waivers (the "Parachute Payment Waivers" )
from each Person who has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result
of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to constitute "parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and as to which such Person waives his or
her rights to some or all of such payments and/or benefits (the  "Waived 280G
Benefits") applicable to such Person so that all remaining payments and/or
benefits applicable to such Person shall not be deemed to be "excess
parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), and
(ii) following the execution of the waivers described in clause (i) and prior
to the Closing Date, solicit the approval of the stockholders of the Company
of any Waived 280G Benefits pursuant to a vote intended to meet the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury regulations
thereunder. At least two (2) Business Days prior to obtaining any waiver or
soliciting stockholder approval, the Company shall provide Parent with copies
of all Section 280G-related documents, including, without limitation, any
Section 280G analysis prepared by the Company, the stockholder disclosure
document, waivers and stockholder consents, for Parent's review and comment
and shall consider all reasonable comments made thereto by Parent. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of
the stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ and that either (A) the requisite number of
votes were obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the "Section
280G Approval"), or (B) that the Section 280G Approval was not obtained, and,
as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided;
_provided_ , that the Parties agree that this _Section 6.9_ shall not be
deemed breached, and no stockholder vote shall be required pursuant to Section
4.11(h), with respect to (x) any 280G Payment to any such Person that refuses
to execute a Parachute Payment Waiver or (y) the value of any arrangement
entered into by or at the direction of Parent or its Affiliates, the material
terms (including value) of which are not disclosed to the Company prior to
the date that is at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

6.10   _401(k) Plan_. The Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Employee Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code (the "401(k) Plans"), unless Parent or one of its
Affiliates, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and
maintain such 401(k) Plans by providing the Company with written notice of
such election at least ten (10) days before the Closing. Unless Parent or one
of its Affiliates provides such notice to the Company, Parent shall receive
from the Company, prior to the Closing, evidence that the board of directors
of the Company or its applicable Affiliate has adopted resolutions to
terminate the 401(k) Plans, effective no later than the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and comment and the Company shall consider all
reasonable comments made thereto by Parent). If Parent, in its sole and
absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any 401(k) Plan and
provides written notice of such election at least 15 (fifteen) days before the
Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to amend such
401(k) Plan, effective as of the Closing, to the extent necessary to limit
participation to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to exclude
all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) from participation in such 401(k) Plan.

  



  

6.11   _Parent 's Financing._

  



  

(a)  Parent's Actions.

  



  

(i)  Parent will use reasonable best efforts to, and will
use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries to, take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
consummate on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment, the Debt Financing, on or prior to the Closing Date. Such
reasonable best efforts will include taking the following actions: (A)
complying with all obligations under, and maintaining in effect, the Debt
Financing Commitment, (B) arranging and obtaining the proceeds of the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment or, if available, on other terms that
are acceptable to Parent and as permitted under this Agreement, (C)
negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing, including the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment (including any "flex" provisions) so that such agreements are in
effect no later than the Closing, (D) satisfying on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Debt Financing and the definitive agreements related
thereto that are within its control and (E) drawing the full amount of the
Debt Financing Proceeds to the extent the funds are necessary at Closing to
pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration (less the Aggregate Parent Stock Value
and less the Aggregate Exercise Price), the Payoff Amount and the Selling
Expenses, and (F) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Debt Financing Documents in order to consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing including in the event of a breach by any lender
providing such Debt Financing that impedes or delays the Closing.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(ii)   Parent will, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after obtaining knowledge thereof, give the Company written notice of any (A)
actual material breach or default or termination by a Financing Party under
the Debt Financing Commitment, (B) amendment or modification of, or waiver
under, the Debt Financing Commitment or (C) change or event which causes
Parent to believe that it will not be able to timely obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
Financing Parties contemplated by the definitive documents related to the
Debt Financing. Parent and its Subsidiaries will not amend, modify or
supplement the Debt Financing Commitment or any related fee letters without
the prior written approval of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), in each case, if such amendment,
modification or supplement would (1) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing below the amount required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (2) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the Debt Financing
on the Closing Date, or (3) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights against the Financing Parties; _provided_ , that Parent may modify,
amend or supplement the Debt Financing Commitment to (A) correct
typographical errors or mistakes, (B) add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents or similar entities or titles that have not executed the Debt
Financing Commitment as of the date hereof or amend titles, allocations and
fee sharing arrangements in connection therewith or (C) increase the amount
of the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent shall
have the right to reduce the commitments under the Debt Financing Commitment
on a dollar-for-dollar basis with the net proceeds of consummated offerings
or other incurrences of any debt for borrowed money incurred after the date of
this Agreement for the purpose of financing payment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and other amounts payable by Parent or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
Parent is a party. In the event that new commitment letters are entered into
in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification of the Debt Financing Commitment permitted pursuant to this
_Section __6.11_ , such new commitment letters will be deemed to be a part of
the "Debt Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt Financing Commitment" for all
purposes of this Agreement. Parent will promptly deliver to the Company
copies of any termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of
the Debt Financing Commitment. In the event that funds in the amounts set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, or any portion thereof, become
unavailable to it on the terms and conditions set forth therein (including,
as necessary, any "flex" provisions), Parent will, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, (x) notify the Company in writing
thereof, (y) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing
(i) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder, (ii) that would not involve any conditions to funding the Debt
Financing that are not contained in the Debt Financing Commitment and (iii)
that would not prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder beyond the Closing Date required to be effected under
this Agreement (the "Substitute Financing") and obtain a new financing
commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly
after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted
form removing commercially sensitive information therein, including the fee
information and "flex" provisions). Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing will be deemed to be a part of the "Debt
Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing will be
deemed the "Debt Financing Commitment" for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(b)   _Company 's Cooperation_.

certificates prior to the Closing), obtaining and/or assisting in obtaining
Payoff Letters and providing true and complete Charter Documents for each
Subsidiary of the Company to the extent required under such financing

respect to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act and certifications regarding
beneficial ownership, (G) causing the independent auditors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to assist and cooperate with Parent in connection with the

(including any senior notes offering) on the Closing Date, it being understood
that except as expressly provided above, no such corporate or other action
will take effect prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the

6.11(b)(i)_ to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with its ongoing
business operations, taken as a whole, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries

other liability or expenses (other than expenses reimbursed by Parent at or
prior to Closing in accordance with the terms of _Section __6.11(b)(ii)_
), (iii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Persons who

whole or in part, in the manner that would not result in the loss of such
privilege) or (E) require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any
action that is prohibited or restricted by, or will conflict with or violate,
its organizational documents, or would result in a violation or breach of, or
default under, any Material Contract to which the Company or any of its

attorneys' fees) or settlement payment incurred as a result of such
cooperation (other than historical information provided in writing by the

representatives), except to the extent such indemnification arises out of
gross negligence, breach or willful misconduct of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors and representatives.

  



  

(iii)  The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that

the Company and its Subsidiaries to potential sources of capital and to

Debt Financing.

  



  

(v)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition
precedent set forth in Section 7.1(b), as it applies to the
Company's obligations under this _Section 6.11_ , shall be deemed as

this _Section 6.11_ is the proximate cause of Parent's failure to obtain the
Debt Financing (including any Substitute Financing) or any financing
contemplated by a senior notes offering and (ii) Parent has provided to the
Company written notice of such breach and, if such breach is curable, the
Company fails to cure such breach by the earlier of (x) five (5) Business

79

 



    



  

(vi) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the
obtaining of the Debt Financing or any Substitute Financing, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Debt Financing
or any Substitute Financing, is a condition to the Closing, and, subject to
Section 10.8(b), reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Debt Financing or any Substitute Financing, or the
completion of any such issuance.

  



  

6.12   _Exclusivity_. Between the date hereof and the earlier to occur

acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, share exchange or asset
purchase) (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"). The Company will, and will cause
its representatives and Affiliates to, (x) cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions, communications or negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II and their respective
representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (y) revoke any such Person's and its authorized
representatives' access to any electronic data room granted in connection

thereof including notifying Parent of the material terms and conditions of
any such inquiries.

Parent Option or any share of Class A Common Stock acquired upon the exercise
of Parent Options are converted (together, the "Prohibited Shares"), with
respect to one-third (1/3rd) of the Share Consideration or the Substitute
Option Consideration received by each such Company Equityholder, during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing until the six-month
anniversary after the Closing Date, and with respect to the other two-thirds
(2/3rds) of the Share Consideration or the Substitute Option Consideration
received by each such Company Equityholder, during the period commencing on

80

 



    



  

(b)   "Permitted Transfer" means, in each case so long as such
Transfer is in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements:

  



  

(i) a Transfer of Prohibited Shares to Affiliates of such
Company Equityholder, so long as such transferee, to the extent it has not
already done so, executes a customary joinder to this _Section __6.13_ , in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, in which such transferee
agrees to be subject to the restrictions on Transfer in this _Section __6.13_
;

  



  

(ii)  a Transfer of Prohibited Shares as a distribution in-
kind to such Company Equityholder's investors, and to their
subsequent investors, including limited partners, so long as all such
transferees, to the extent it has not already done so, executes a

acceptable to the Parent, in which such transferee agrees to be subject to
the restrictions on Transfer in this _Section __6.13_ ;

(vi)  if the Company Equityholder is an individual, a
Transfer of Prohibited Shares to an immediate family member or a trust

Equityholder's immediate family members, so long as such transferee, to the
extent it has not already done so, executes a customary joinder to this
_Section __6.13_ , in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, in
which such transferee agrees to be subject to the restrictions on Transfer in
this _Section __6.13_ ;

  



  

(vii)  a Transfer of Prohibited Shares pursuant to the laws

Code.

  



  

(x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, including the occurrence of the Restricted Period Termination Date,

securities" as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the
Prohibited Shares may not be Transferred other than pursuant to a registered
offering or in accordance with an exemption from registration. No Transfers
of Prohibited Shares shall be made to a person that, to such Company
Equityholder's knowledge, is a competitor of Parent set forth on _Exhibit P_
attached hereto or becomes a competitor of Parent after the date hereof, as
set forth on a quarterly or annual report filed by Parent with the SEC;

shall prohibit any Transfer of Prohibited Shares on an exchange or otherwise
in open market transactions or non-privately negotiated transactions or to a
hedge fund or other institutional investor, other than a hedge fund or other
institutional investor that is known by such Company Equityholder after
reasonable inquiry to hold more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
securities of any such competitor; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing
contained in this _Section  __6.13(b)(x)_ shall prohibit any Transfer of
Prohibited Shares in accordance with any of the foregoing clauses (ii), (iv)
or (ix) of this _Section __6.13(b)_ (unless such Transfer was structured in
such manner for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this _Section
6.13(b)(x)_ ).

Proxy Statement and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to otherwise
assist and cooperate with Parent in the preparation of the Proxy Statement
and the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC if and
to the extent reasonably requested by Parent. Each of Parent, the Stockholder
Representative and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative promptly upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the
Stockholder Representative with copies of all written correspondence between
Parent or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to
resolve such comments with the SEC, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such comments.
Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the stockholders of Parent, or
responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, Parent shall
provide the Stockholder Representative with a reasonable opportunity to review
and to propose comments on such document or response, which Parent shall
consider in good faith.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.14(a)_, Parent shall take all necessary
actions in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and the Charter
Documents of Parent to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (including any adjournment, recess or postponement
thereof, the " _Parent Stockholders ' Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Parent may, in its sole discretion, temporarily adjourn,
recess, or postpone the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (i) after consultation
with the Stockholder Representative, to the extent necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
the stockholders of Parent within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting or (iii) to solicit additional
proxies if Parent reasonably believes it may be necessary to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent will resume any adjourned, recessed or
postponed meeting as promptly as practicable.

6.15   _Company Written Consent; Company Voting and Support
Agreements; Stockholder Notice._

  



  

(a)  As promptly as possible following the execution of this
Agreement (but in any event within twenty four (24) hours), the Company shall
deliver to Parent (i) a written consent (or written consents) of the
Stockholders holding (i) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series C Preferred Stock (voting together as
a single class) adopting this Agreement and approving the First Merger in
accordance with the DGCL and the Company's Charter Documents in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ ("Company Written Consent") and (ii) the
Voting and Support Agreements of the Company in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit I_ (the "Company Voting and Support Agreements") executed by
Stockholders, including each holder of Company Series C Preferred Stock,
holding sufficient type and number of shares of Company Capital Stock to
adopt this Agreement and approve the First Merger in accordance with the DGCL
and the Company's Charter Documents.

  



  

(b)  The Company shall promptly (and in any event prior to the
Closing) deliver to any Stockholder who has not executed the Company Written
Consent a notice of the actions taken pursuant to the Company Written Consent
that complies with the requirements of Section 228(e) of the DGCL, which
notice shall also constitute and include the notice required by Section 262 of
the DGCL that appraisal or similar rights may be available to the
Stockholders who did not execute the Company Written Consent (the
"Stockholder Notice"). The Stockholder Notice, as well as any information
statement prepared by the Company in which the Stockholder Notice shall be
included, shall be subject to review and approval by Parent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and the Company shall consider in good faith
any comments proposed by Parent to the draft Stockholder Notice.

  



  

6.16 _Accredited Investor Certifications_. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger
Sub II and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Share Consideration to
be issued as consideration in the First Merger will not be registered under
the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Company Equityholder who is not
a party to a Company Voting and Support Agreement shall be entitled to
receive Share Consideration in connection with the First Merger only if such
Company Equityholder is (a) an accredited investor within the meaning of SEC
Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect, under the Securities Act
and (b) provides an executed accredited investor questionnaire in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (an  "Accredited
Investor Questionnaire") no later than 6:00 pm Eastern Time on January 15,
2020 (the  "Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline"), unless the Company
otherwise determines that such Company Equityholder is not an Accredited
Investor. Each Accredited Investor Questionnaire shall also contain
restrictions on the resale of the Share Consideration consistent with the
restrictions set forth in _Section 6.13_ hereof. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof), deliver to each
Company Equityholder who is not a party to a Company Voting and Support
Agreement an Accredited Investor Questionnaire and request that each such
Company Equityholder complete an Accredited Investor Questionnaire and return
it to the Company by the Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline. If any
Company Equityholder delivers an Accredited Investor Questionnaire to
the Company, the Company shall promptly deliver a copy of such Accredited
Investor Questionnaire to Parent. Any Company Equityholder that does not
execute and deliver a Company Voting and Support Agreement or an Accredited
Investor Questionnaire by the Accredited Investor Questionnaire Deadline
certifying such Company Equityholder's status as an Accredited Investor
shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be deemed not to be an Accredited
Investor.

6.17   _Board Rights._

  



  

(a) Promptly following the Closing Date, and in any event within
five (5) business days following the Closing Date, Parent shall increase the
size of the Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board of Directors") by
two (2) members to eleven (11) members and, promptly following such increase,
and in any event within five (5) business days following the Closing Date,
shall cause Ted Lundberg to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors
(the "Nomination Right Board Representative"), as a Class II director, and
cause Stephen Griggs to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors
(the "Other Board Representative" and together with the Nomination Right Board
Representative, the "Board Representatives"), as a Class I director. For so
long as Peloton Equity AeroCare SPV I, L.P. and SkyKnight Aero Holdings, LLC
(the "Nomination Rights Holders") or an Affiliate of the Nomination Rights
Holders hold in the aggregate among them at least 35% of the Share
Consideration, on an as-converted basis, issued to the Nomination Rights
Holders hereunder, on an as-converted basis, the Nomination Rights Holders
shall continue to have the right to nominate the Nomination Rights Board
Representative. The election or appointment of the Board Representatives
will be subject to satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements
regarding service as a director of Parent and to the reasonable approval of
the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_
, that the parties hereto agree that election of Stephen Griggs and Ted
Lundberg to serve as the Board Representatives shall be acceptable and no such
approval of the Nominating and Governance Committee shall be required. Parent
will reimburse the Board Representatives for their respective reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with travel to
or from and attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, in each
case to the same extent provided to other non-employee directors. The
Nomination Rights Board Representative will receive the same director
compensation as each other non-executive director of the Board of
Directors. The Nomination Rights Holders agree, upon Parent's request, to
timely provide Parent with accurate and complete information relating to the
Nomination Rights Board Representative as may be required to be disclosed by
Parent under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Board will not form any "executive" or similar committees
that do not include the Board Representatives. Notwithstanding any rights to
be granted with respect to the Board Representatives hereunder, the Board of
Directors may exclude the Board Representatives from access to any Board
of Directors or committee materials or information or meeting or portion
thereof or written consent if the Board of Directors determines, in good
faith, including the Board Representatives in discussions relating to such
determination (but not requiring the affirmative vote of such Board
Representatives), that such access would reasonably be expected to result in
a conflict of interest with Parent; _provided_ , that such exclusion shall be
limited to the portion of the Board of Directors or committee material or
information and/or meeting or written consent that is the basis for such
exclusion and shall not extend to any portion of the Board of Directors or
committee material and/or meeting that does not involve or pertain to such
exclusion.

  



  

   

84

 



    



  

(b)  Following the Closing Date and for so long as Peloton Equity
AeroCare SPV I, L.P. and SkyKnight Aero Holdings, LLC (each an "Observer
Rights Holder") or such Observer Rights Holder's Affiliate holds at least 35%
of the Share Consideration, on an as-converted basis, issued to such Observer
Rights Holder hereunder, on an as-converted basis, each such Observer Rights
Holder shall have the right to designate a non-voting observer of the Board of
Directors, which observer shall be an employee, investment professional or
partner of such Observer Rights Holder or one of its Affiliates. The observer
shall be entitled to receive notice of and have the right to attend any and
all meetings of the Board of Directors, and Parent shall provide the observer
with copies of all notices, minutes, consents and other material in
connection therewith at the same time as such materials are distributed to
members of the Board of Directors; _provided_ , that (A) such Observer Rights
Holder shall cause the observer to agree to hold in confidence all
information provided to the observer pursuant hereto, (B) Parent and the Board
of Directors shall have the right to withhold any information and to exclude
the observer from any meeting or portion thereof (1) if doing so is, in the
opinion of outside counsel to Parent, advisable or necessary to protect the
attorney-client privilege between Parent and counsel or (2) if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that fiduciary requirements under applicable law would make attendance by the
observer not advisable; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if Parent and/or
the Board of Directors withhold any information or exclude the observer from
any meeting pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), to the extent practicable
they shall give such Observer Rights Holder notice of such withholding or
exclusion and the parties shall cooperate in seeking to allow disclosure of
such information in a manner that is not reasonably likely (in the good faith
belief of Parent and the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside
counsel)) to contravene such applicable law or cause such privilege to be
waived. The observer shall have no right to vote on any matters presented to
the Board of Directors. All obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section
6.17(b)_ shall terminate with respect to an Observer Rights Holder upon such
Observer Rights Holder ceasing to have the right to designate the observer
pursuant to this _Section 6.17(b)_. Parent will reimburse any observer
appointed pursuant to _Section 6.17(b)_ for their respective reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with travel to or
from and attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, in each case to
the same extent provided to other non-employee directors.

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

(c)   For so long as the Nomination Rights Holders have the right to
designate or nominate the Nomination Rights Board Representative pursuant to
_Section 6.17(a)_, Parent and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the
Board of Directors shall take such action as is required under applicable
Legal Requirements or under the Charter Documents of Parent to include on the
Board of Directors or in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of
Directors such person designated or nominated, as the case may be, by the
Nomination Rights Holders pursuant to _Section 6.17(a)_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Nomination Rights Board Representative
elected as a director of Parent and Parent shall solicit proxies for such
person to the same extent as it does for any of its other nominees to the
Board of Directors. For so long as the Nomination Rights Holders have the
right to designate or nominate the Nomination Rights Board Representative, in
the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death, disability,
retirement, resignation or removal of the Nomination Rights Board
Representative, the Nomination Rights Holders may designate or nominate, as
applicable, another individual to be elected to fill the vacancy created
thereby, and Parent hereby agrees to take, at any time and from time to time,
all actions necessary to accomplish the same.

  



  

(d)  Parent shall maintain in effect at all times directors' and
officers' indemnity insurance covering the Nomination Rights Board
Representative to the same extent and on the same terms as any directors' and
officers' indemnity insurance maintained by Parent with respect to the other
non-executive members of the Board of Directors. Any directors' and
officers' indemnity insurance shall be primary to any insurance coverage for
the Nomination Rights Board Representative maintained by any other person.
Upon the appointment of the Board Representatives to the Board of Directors,
Parent and the Board Representatives shall enter into an indemnification
agreement substantially similar to the form included as Exhibit 10.4 to
Parent's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the
"Indemnification Agreement").

  



  

(e)  All obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.17_
relating to the Nomination Rights Board Representative shall terminate, and,
upon request by the Board of Directors, the Nomination Rights Holders shall
cause the Nomination Rights Board Representative to resign promptly from the
Board of Directors, in each case upon the Nomination Rights Holders ceasing to
have the right to designate or nominate a director pursuant to _Section 5.1_.
All obligations of Parent pursuant to this  _Section 6.17_ relating to the
Other Board Representative shall terminate, and, upon request by the Board of
Directors, the Other Board Representative will resign promptly from the Board
of Directors, in each case upon the Other Board Representative ceasing to be
employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries. Any vacancy created by such
resignation may be filled by the Board of Directors or the shareholders of
Parent in accordance its Charter Documents and applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

6.18   _Information Rights_. From and after the date hereof and for so
long as each Information Rights Holder or an Affiliate of such Information
Rights Holder holds at least 25% of the Share Consideration, on an as-
converted basis, issued to such Information Rights Holder hereunder, on an
as-converted basis:

  



  

(a) Parent will provide to such Information Rights Holder the
annual, quarterly and periodic reports of Parent in the time periods required
for the filing of such reports with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable
after they become available; _provided_ , _however_ , that the filing of such
reports with the SEC shall satisfy such delivery requirement.

  



  

   

86

 



    



   



  

(b) Parent will permit such Information Rights Holder and its
representatives, at such Information Rights Holder's expense, to
reasonable and customary rights to the information of Parent and access to
management of Parent, all at such reasonable times and as often as may be
reasonably requested.

  



  

6.19   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, recording, value-added and other
similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
("Transfer Taxes") and all expenses of filing Tax Returns with respect to
such Taxes will be borne one-half by Parent and one-half by the Company (as a
Selling Expense). Each Person required by applicable law agrees to file, or
cause to be filed, in a timely manner all necessary documents (including, but
not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(b)   _Tax Opinions_.

  



  

(i)  Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall
use its respective reasonable best efforts to, and cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, (i) cause the Mergers to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii)
obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 7.1(k)_. Neither Parent,
Merger Sub I, nor Merger Sub II shall take any action which (or fail to take
any action, including failing to use its reasonable best efforts to
proscribe any of its respective Subsidiaries from taking any action, the
failure of which) could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede such
qualification. In addition, at the request of the Company in connection with a
Dividend Recapitalization, Parent shall cooperate in good faith to consider
alternative structures for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
order for the transactions to qualify as a reorganization described in
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, including by converting Merger Sub II into a
limited liability company treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

  



  

(ii)  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to,
and cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause the Mergers to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii)
obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 7.2(j)_. The Company
shall not take any action which (or fail to take any action, including failing
to use its reasonable best efforts to proscribe any of its Subsidiaries from
taking any action, the failure of which) could reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede such qualification.

  



  

(iii) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, (i) each
of the Parties shall report the Mergers for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code in all
Tax Returns, and (ii) none of the Parties shall take any Tax reporting
position inconsistent with the characterization of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code. The Parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g).

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(iv)  Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Goodwin Procter LLP

case, if applicable) at such time or times as requested by the
Company's Counsel or Parent's Counsel (or Company's Replacement Counsel or
Parent's Replacement Counsel, in each case, if applicable) letters signed by
an officer thereof and containing representations reasonably requested by
Company's Counsel and Parent's Counsel for the purposes of obtaining (i) the
tax opinion from Parent's Counsel (or Parent's Replacement Counsel, if
applicable) described in _Section 7.1(l)_ and (ii) the tax opinion from the
Company's Counsel (or Company's Replacement Counsel, if applicable) described
in _Section 7.2(i)_ (such letters, the "Tax Representation Letters"). Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate with one another and provide such other
information as reasonably requested by requested by Parent's Counsel or the
Company's Counsel (or Parent's Replacement Counsel or Company's
Replacement Counsel, in each case if applicable) for purposes of rendering
the opinions described in _Sections 7.1(l)_ and _7.2(i)_.

for listing of the Share Consideration to be issued to the
Accredited Investors pursuant to this Agreement and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Nasdaq to have completed its review of a "Listing of
Additional Shares Notification Form" prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

6.22   _[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]_.

  



  

6.23   _Form S-8._ Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Parent Options
issued in substitution of the assumed Vested Substitute Options for which a
Form S-8 registration statement is available to be registered with the SEC on
Form S-8 in conjunction with the filing of the Merger Resale Shelf
Registration Statement (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated
Registration Rights Agreement) (assuming timely receipt of all documentation
relating to such Vested Substitute Options outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time and all opinions and consents required for such
registration statement) to be registered with the SEC and will exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such substitute Parent Options remain
outstanding and Parent has one or more other Registration Statements on Form
S-8 on file with the SEC and will reserve a sufficient number of shares of
Class A Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or settlement thereof. The
Company and its counsel will reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in
the preparation of such registration statement. The Form S-8 registration
statement shall not cover the shares of Class A Common Stock subject to any
Vested Substitute Options that are not Employee Options.

  



  

6.24   _Excess Capital Equipment_. Between the date of the physical
inventory pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ and the Closing, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, sell, lease or otherwise dispose

any Contract to take any such action.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

6.25   _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the
Parent shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of

Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Class A Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to such Class A Common Stock) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, if applicable.

by this Agreement. In rendering such opinion, Company's Counsel (or
Company's Replacement Counsel, if applicable) shall be entitled to rely upon
the representations contained in the Tax Representation Letters of Parent and
the Company referred to in _Section 6.19(b)(iv)_ hereto.

ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

8.1   _Representation and Warranty Insurance_ _._ Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
Parent such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary to
obtain a claims made representation and warranty insurance policy ("Special
Policy" ), including by reasonably assisting Parent in providing customary
information as may reasonably be requested by any insurance broker or
insurance carrier in connection therewith.

  



  

8.2 _Indemnification by Company Equityholders_. Subject to the
provisions of this _Article VIII_, from and after the Closing, the Company
Equityholders, solely from the Special Escrow Deposit, hereby agree to
indemnify and hold harmless Parent, its Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, managers, officers and Affiliates (collectively, the
"Parent Indemnitees" or "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Losses of such Parent Indemnitees resulting from or arising out of the
Special Matter.

  



  

8.3   _Survival_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement and the covenants and agreements in this Agreement that by their
terms are to be performed or complied with at or prior to the Closing (the
"Pre-Closing Covenants" ), in each case, shall terminate effective as of the
Closing, shall not survive the Closing for any purpose, and neither Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Affiliates nor the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Equityholder or any of its
or their respective Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to any
such representations or warranties or Pre-Closing Covenants, except in the
case of Fraud. The Company Equityholders' indemnification obligations under
_Section 8.2_ shall survive until the settlement or other similar final
resolution of the Special Matter (the "Special Matter Termination Date"). Any
covenant or agreement contained herein that by its terms is to be performed
or complied with after the Closing ("Post-Closing Covenants" ) shall survive
the Closing until fully performed or fulfilled unless and only to the extent
that non-compliance with such covenant or agreement is waived by the party
entitled to such performance.

  



  

8.4   _Limitations on Indemnification; Procedures_.

  



  

(a) The Special Escrow Deposit shall be the sole and exclusive
source of recovery for any and all amounts payable to Parent or any of the
other Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Article VIII_, and then only for Losses
resulting from or arising out of the Special Matter pursuant to _Section 8.2_
and in accordance with this _Article VIII_. Promptly following the Special
Matter Termination Date, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release and deliver from the Special
Escrow Account, subject to the Escrow Agreement, any portion of the
Special Escrow Deposit in excess of any unresolved bona fide claim made
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ within five (5) Business Days after the Special
Matter Termination Date, (i) to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to
the Company Equityholders (other than holders of Vested Company Options that
are Employee Options) and (ii) to Parent (or its designee) for further
distribution to the holders of Vested Company Options that are Employee
Options on the next regularly scheduled payment date, through the payroll
system of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax
withholding, in each case, in accordance with the percentage of such amount
payable to each Company Equityholder based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares as set forth in the Closing Consideration Schedule.

  



  

   

92

 



    



  

(b)  The amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of any
current liability in respect of the Special Matter included in the
calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Measurement Time as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_. The amount of any and all Losses
will also be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by any Parent
Indemnitees under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses
(and Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under any applicable insurance
policies).

  



  

8.5   _Defense of the Special Matter_. Following the Closing, the
Indemnified Parties may assume defense of the Special Matter (and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to successfully conduct such defense and
promptly resolve the Special Matter); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no
Indemnified Party will agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the Special Matter without the prior
written consent of the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Company
Equityholders (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to participate in the defense
of the Special Matter and to employ counsel of its own choosing, at its own
cost, for such purpose, in each case on behalf of the Company Equityholders.

  



  

8.6   _Sole and Exclusive Recourse_.

  



  

(a)  Each of Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree
that the Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing
against the Company Equityholders with respect to any breach of, or inaccuracy
in, any representation or warranty or the failure to perform under any Pre-
Closing Covenant, and with respect to any and all claims relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be the Special Policy and the Special Escrow Deposit, except
for Fraud or any breach of, or inaccuracy in, or failure to perform under any
covenant or obligation, in each case, set forth in any separate written
agreement, document or instrument to which such Company Equityholder is a
party or signatory (including, for the avoidance of doubt, failure to comply
with any requirement in such agreement to comply with any provision of this
Agreement).

  



  

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.9_ shall not be
considered "remedies" for purposes of this _Section 8.6_ and shall not be
limited by the terms of this _Section 8.6_.

  



  

8.7   _[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]_

  



  

8.8   _Treatment for Tax Purposes_. For all applicable Tax purposes,
each party hereto and its respective Affiliates agree to treat any indemnity
payment under this _Article VIII _as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement.

  



  

   

93

 



    



  

8.9   _Acknowledgement; Waiver_.

  



  

(a)  EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF FRAUD OR ANY BREACH OR DEFAULT IN
PERFORMANCE OF ANY POST-CLOSING COVENANT, OTHER THAN THE REMEDIES EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED FOR IN THIS _ARTICLE VIII_ IN RESPECT OF THE SPECIAL MATTER, THE
PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 2.9_, ANY AVAILABLE REMEDIES

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE UNDER _SECTION 10.8_, EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY (FROM
AND AFTER THE CLOSING), MERGER SUB AND MERGER SUB II, ON THEIR OWN BEHALF AND
ON BEHALF OF THEIR AFFILIATES, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY
REMEDY, LIABILITY AND ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE AGAINST ANY COMPANY EQUITYHOLDER
OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR RESULTING
FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY PURSUANT
TO LAW OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. FURTHERMORE, PARENT, THE COMPANY (FROM AND
AFTER THE CLOSING), MERGER SUB AND MERGER SUB II, ON THEIR OWN BEHALF AND ON
BEHALF OF THEIR AFFILIATES, EACH COVENANTS NOT TO SUE OR OTHERWISE THREATEN
ANY CLAIM THAT INCLUDES ANY REMEDY WAIVED BY THE PRECEDING. PARENT, THE
COMPANY (FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING) MERGER SUB AND MERGER SUB II, ON THEIR
OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THEIR AFFILIATES, EACH AGREES THAT, TO THE EXTENT
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO BE EFFECTIVE, THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE WAIVERS AND RELEASES CONTAINED IN THIS  _SECTION 8.9(a)_ ARE CONSPICUOUS.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.9(a)_, except for
Fraud or for any breach or default of any Post-Closing Covenant, other than
the remedies expressly provided for in this _Article VIII_, the purchase price
adjustment provisions of _Section 2.9_, any available remedies under any
other Transaction Documents and its rights of specific performance under
_Section 10.8_, Parent, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), and any of its and their respective agents, successors
and permitted assigns (including Parent, each, a "Waiving Party"),
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action it may have against Company, any Company
Equityholder or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the business
conducted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the operation of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses or
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether arising under, or based upon, any Legal
Requirement (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to
seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other
recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law) are hereby
irrevocably waived by the Waiving Parties. Parent, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each Waiving Party, acknowledges and agrees that the Waiving
Parties may not avoid such limitation on liability by seeking damages for
breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all of
which are hereby waived. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limits
imposed on the Waiving Parties' remedies with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby were bargained for between sophisticated
parties and were specifically taken into account in the determination of the
amounts to be paid by Parent hereunder.

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

(c)  EXCEPT FOR FRAUD (AS DEFINED IN THIS AGREEMENT) OR ANY BREACH OR
DEFAULT OF ANY POST-CLOSING COVENANT, AND OTHER THAN THE REMEDIES PROVIDED
FOR IN THIS _ARTICLE VIII_ , THE PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS OF
_SECTION 2.9_, ANY AVAILABLE REMEDIES UNDER ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
AND ITS RIGHTS OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE UNDER _SECTION 10.8_, PARENT, ON ITS
OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF EACH WAIVING PARTY, EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES WHICH
LIMITS THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. PARENT, ON ITS
OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF EACH WAIVING PARTY, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER
OF ANY STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. PARENT, ON
BEHALF OF THE WAIVING PARTIES, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN
ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

8.10   _No Reliance_ _._ AS MODIFIED BY THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE, THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY
CONTAINED IN _ARTICLE IV_ , AND OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND MERGER SUB II IN
_ARTICLE V_ , OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO
_SECTION 2.3_ , CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, AND SUCH CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO
_SECTION 2.3_, NEITHER COMPANY NOR PARENT MAKES ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE AND EACH OF COMPANY AND PARENT
HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE
EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS
NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN _ARTICLE IV_ AND _ARTICLE V_ AND EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE OTHER PARTY'S
WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION  8.10_ OR OTHERWISE, NOTHING IN THIS _SECTION
8.10_ SHALL IN ANY MANNER (I) LIMIT EITHER PARTY'S RIGHTS UNDER

MERIT OF, ANY CLAIM OF FRAUD.

  



  

8.11   _Non-Recourse_. Any claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance or
breach (whether willful, intentional or otherwise) of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as a Party. No Person who
is not a named Party to this Agreement, including without limitation any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named Party
to this Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that
seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates)
for any obligations or liabilities based upon, arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of,
arising out of, related to or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance or breach (whether willful, intentional or otherwise);
and each Party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliate and expressly disclaims
reliance on upon any Non-Party Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made (or alleged to have
been made) in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this

beneficiaries of this _Section 8.11_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 8.11_ shall in no way limit the liabilities of Company Equityholders
expressly set forth in the Company Voting and Support Agreements or Stock
Letter of Transmittal.

ARTICLE IX 
 TERMINATION

  



  

9.1   _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated
prior to the Closing only as provided below:

  



  

(a)  by Parent and Company if both agree to terminate this Agreement
by mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

  



  

(b)  by either Parent or Company (with respect to each of the
following, treating Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II as one):

  



  

(i)  if any Order of a Governmental Entity having the
effect set forth in _Section __7.1(c)_ or _Section __7.2(c)_  shall be in
effect and shall have become non-appealable, final and permanent at any time
prior to the Closing and the terminating Party delivered written notice of
such event to the other Party; _provided_ , that no Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section __9.1(b)(i)_ if the Order described in
this _Section __9.1(b)(i)_ resulted primarily from such Party's breach of any
representation or warranty made by it herein or the failure of such Party to
fulfill any of its covenants in this Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) at any time on or after May 31, 2021 (such date, as
extended pursuant to _Section __10.8_ , the  "Outside Date") upon written
notice to the other Party if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or prior to such date;
_provided_ , that no Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section __9.1(b)(ii)_ if such Party is in breach of any representation or
warranty made by it herein or has failed to fulfill any of its covenants in
this Agreement, and such breach or failure has prevented the satisfaction of
the other Party's conditions to Closing hereunder or was the primary cause of
the failure to consummate the Closing prior to the Outside Date.

  



  

   

96

 



    



  

(c)  by Parent, on the one hand, or Company, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other, if the other shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to
perform: (i) would primarily give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_ (in the case of a breach or failure
to perform by Company) or _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section  7.2(b)_ (in the case
of a breach or failure to perform by Parent) and (ii) cannot be or has not
been cured prior to the earlier of: (A) the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to
the Outside Date or (B) the date that is twenty (20) Business Days from the
date that Parent or Company, as applicable, is notified by the other in
writing of such breach or failure to perform;  _provided_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available to
(x) Parent if there has been a breach or failure to perform by Parent that
would give the Company the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)_ or (y) Company if there has been a breach or failure to
perform by Company that would give Parent the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ ;

  



  

(d)  by the Company, if (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are required to be
satisfied at the Closing, but all such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied) shall have been satisfied or waived, (ii) the Parent has failed to
consummate the Closing on the date on which the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to _Section 2.3_, (iii) after the occurrence of the events
described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the Company has irrevocably
(for the two (2) Business Day period described in the following clause (iii))
confirmed to Parent in writing that the Company is prepared and able to
consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, that
if the Debt Financing were to be funded, will consummate the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that all of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than conditions that, by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
and (iii) the Parent has failed to consummate the Closing within two (2)
Business Days after such notification (it being understood that such
confirmation remains in full force and effect at the close of business on
such second (2nd) Business Day);

  



  

(e)  By Parent, if the Company shall have not delivered the executed
Company Written Consent to Parent within twenty-four (24) hours of the
execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section  9.1(e)_ shall only be available to Parent
until the earlier of (y) the date and time that the Company delivers the
executed Company Written Consent to Parent and (z) the date that is five (5)
Business Days after the execution of this Agreement; or

  



  

(f) By Parent, if the Company shall have not delivered or caused to
be delivered to Parent the executed Company Voting and Support Agreements
listed on _Section 7.1(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule within twenty-four (24)
hours of the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , that that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(f)_ shall only be available
to Parent until the earlier of (y) the date and time that the Company delivers
all such executed Company Voting and Support Agreements to Parent and (z) the
date that is five (5) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

   

97

 



    



  

9.2   _Effect of Termination._

  



  

(a)  In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, written notice thereof will be given by the
terminating Party to the other Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and all obligations of the Parties
hereunder (other than obligations under _Section 6.2_, _Section
6.11(b)(ii)_,  _Section 6.24_, this _Section 9.2_ and _ARTICLE X_ , and any
related definitions contained in any such Sections and Article, which shall
survive termination) shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any
other Party; _provided,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, liability may exist for breach of, or
otherwise with respect to, the provisions of this Agreement specified in the
foregoing parenthetical (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent's
liability for the Termination Fee and Collection Costs, if applicable).
Nothing in this Section 9.2 will be deemed to impair the right of any Party
to compel specific performance by another Party of its obligations under this
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event
of the termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will
survive the termination of this Agreement for the period set forth therein.

  



  

(b)  In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_ then Parent shall
pay Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000) (the "Termination Fee") to Company (or
any designee of Company) within five (5) Business Days following such
termination, payable by wire transfer of same day funds (it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Termination
Fee or any Collection Costs on more than one occasion). If Parent fails to
promptly pay the Termination Fee when due pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in
a final and unappealable judgment against Parent for the payment of the
Termination Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company or its designee its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid to
independent third parties (including attorneys' fees of outside counsel) in
connection with any Action relating to the Termination Fee, together with
interest on the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to four percent (4%)
_plus_ the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date of termination beginning on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment (such interest
payment, together with the collection costs, the "Collection Costs").

  



  

   

98

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
except for (i) the Company's remedies under the Confidentiality Agreement
or in the event of Fraud, and (ii) the Company's right to seek and obtain
specific performance as to and to the extent permitted by _Section 8.10_ and
the amounts contemplated by _Section 10.8(c)_ , the right of Company (or
any designee of Company) to receive the Termination Fee (plus any Collection
Costs, as applicable) pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ (if payable pursuant to
the terms thereof) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) of Company or any of its
Affiliates against Parent and any of its Affiliates' former, current or
future direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, advisers, attorneys, representatives,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively,
the  "Parent Related Parties" ) for any and all breaches (whether knowing,
willful, intentional or otherwise), losses, liabilities or damages,
including, but not limited to, special, indirect or punitive damages, suffered
or incurred by Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither
Company nor any other Person shall have any further or other recourse to, or
rights or remedies against, or be entitled to bring or be entitled to assert,
bring or maintain, and Company on behalf of itself and each its respective
Affiliates, former, current or future direct or indirect equityholders,
controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
representatives, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees
(collectively, the "Company Releasing Related Parties" ) hereby waives any
right to assert, bring or maintain, any claim, demand, suit, action or
proceeding against Parent any other Parent Related Party arising out of,
under, or in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation, execution,
performance, termination hereof, or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement hereunder (whether intentional, willful, negligent or
otherwise) hereof, the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment
or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
whether by or through (a) attempted piercing of the corporate veil, (b) a
claim by or on behalf of Parent or one of its Affiliates against another
Parent Related Party or (c) any legal or equitable proceeding whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt,
under no circumstances will Company or any other Company Releasing Related
Party be entitled to any monetary amounts (whether money damages or any
other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages) in excess of the amount of the Termination Fee
(plus any Collection Costs, as applicable). In the event this Agreement is
terminated and Parent becomes obligated to pay the Termination Fee (plus any
Collection Costs), no Company Releasing Related Party shall have the right to
seek, obtain or be entitled to money damages (whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) from any of Parent or Parent Related Parties
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment or in respect
of any other agreement, theory of law or otherwise including for any breach,
loss or damage under or related to this Agreement other than specifically set
forth in this _Section 9.2(c)_. While the Company may pursue both (x) a
grant of specific performance prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section 10.8_
and the amounts contemplated by _Section 10.8(c)_ , on the one hand, and (y)
the payment of the Termination Fee (plus any Collection Costs, as applicable)
pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ , on the other hand, under no circumstances
shall the Company or any other Company Releasing Related Party be entitled to
receive both (1) a grant of specific performance and the amounts contemplated
by _Section 10.8(c)_  and (2) all or any portion of the Termination Fee (plus
any Collection Costs, as applicable); _provided_ ; _however_ , that, in the
event Parent is compelled to effect the Closing pursuant to an Order granting
specific performance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
Parent fails to effect the Closing notwithstanding such Order, the Termination
Fee would remain available to the Company in lieu of specific performance and
the consummation of the Closing. In addition, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company, on behalf of itself and of its
Company Releasing Related Parties, hereby waives any claims against the
Financing Parties and hereby agrees that in no event shall the Financing
Parties have any liability or obligation to the Stockholder Representative,
the Company or any Company Releasing Related Party relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitments or
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided,_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.2(c)_ shall in any way limit or modify
the rights and obligations of Parent under the Debt Financing Commitments.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) any payment of the Termination Fee (plus any Collection
Costs, as applicable) is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Company in the circumstances in which
such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and
the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

  



  

   

99

 



    



  

(e)  In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(e) or 9.1(f), the Company shall pay to the
Parent or its designee, or reimburse the Parent or its designee for, as
applicable, the Purchasing Expenses. If Parent fails to promptly pay the
Purchasing Expenses when due pursuant to this Section 9.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a final and
unappealable judgment against the Company for the payment of the Purchasing
Expenses, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid to independent third parties
(including attorneys' fees of outside counsel) in connection with any Action
relating to the Purchasing Expenses, together with interest on the Purchasing
Expenses at a rate per annum equal to four percent (4%) plus the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
of termination beginning on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding this _Article IX_ or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, subject to _Section 10.8(b)_ , Parent affirms that
it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its obligations under this
Agreement that Parent (or any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE X 
 GENERAL

  



  

10.1   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
contain the sole and entire agreements between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
discussions, understandings, negotiations, and agreements (whether written or
oral) among the Parties or between any of them with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  



  

10.2 _Successor and Assigns; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents nor the rights and obligations hereunder
or thereunder may be assigned, subcontracted or otherwise delegated or
transferred without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, Parent and Company. All of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement will be binding
upon, and inure solely for the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns (and in the
case of indemnities, for the benefit of all Persons indemnified). Nothing
herein expressed or implied is intended or will be construed to confer upon or
to give to any Person that is not a Party any rights, claims or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, except as set forth in _Section 6.3_, _Section 8.4_, _Section
8.11_ and _Section 10.10 _and for parties expressly entitled to the
protection of any indemnification provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Financing Party is an express third party beneficiary of
_Sections 9.2_, ___10.3_ , ___10.5_ and this _Section 10.2_ and may enforce
such provisions as if direct parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Company Equityholder is an
express third party beneficiary of _Sections 6.13_ , _6.14_ , _6.16_ , _6.17_

superseded, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by

no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by
any Party of any condition, or of any breach of any term,
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one
or more instances, will be deemed to be or construed as a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other

warranty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Sections 9.2_,  __ _10.2_ ,

claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether

execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claim that (x) the suit,

WHETHER MADE BY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE. EACH

OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.5_.

  



  

   

103

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of
the parties hereto agrees (i) that it will not bring or support, or permit
any its Affiliates to bring or support, any Legal Proceeding, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Parties arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or
the performance of services thereunder or related thereto in any forum other

right to trial by jury in respect of any such Legal Proceeding and (iii) that
any such Legal Proceeding shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such State that would result in the application of the laws of
any other state.

  



  

10.6   _Severability_. In the event that any of the provisions hereof
is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable Legal Requirements,
the remaining provisions hereof will not be affected thereby. In such event,
the Parties hereto agree and consent that such provisions and this Agreement
will be modified and reformed so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible with respect to those provisions which were
held to be invalid or unenforceable.

  



  

10.7   _Transaction Costs and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Company and the Stockholder Representative,
on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II, on the other hand,
shall bear all of their own costs, fees and expenses, if any, incurred by or
on their behalf in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions covered hereby; _provided_ , that fees
associated with the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, all filing
fees pursuant to the HSR Act, and the premiums of the Tail Policy (subject to
the proviso in Section 6.3(b)) and the Special Policy each shall be borne
equally by the Company and Parent; _provided, further_ , that any Transfer
Taxes that arise from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be borne as set forth in _Section  6.19(a)_. The costs,
fees and expenses to be paid by the Company may be (a) paid by the Company
prior to the Closing or (b) included in Selling Expenses and thus taken into
consideration in the calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

  



  

   

104

 



    



  

10.8   _Specific Enforcement._

  



  

(a) Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed (including by
failure to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including the obligation of
the Parties to consummate such transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement).
Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available under this
Agreement, the Parties agree that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement and, as and when required pursuant to _Section 9.2_, payment of the
Termination Fee (plus any Collection Costs, as applicable) to the Company,
each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent the other Party's breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement including Parent's (subject to _Section 10.8(b)_) or the
Company's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if required to do so hereunder. Each Party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and
hereby waives (x) any defenses in any action for an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief, including the defense that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity, and (y) any
requirement under Legal Requirement to post a bond, undertaking or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be
entitled to specific performance or other equitable remedies (or to seek
specific performance or other equitable remedies) to cause Parent to effect
the Closing, unless (i) all conditions in _Sections 7.1_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are required to be
satisfied at the Closing, but all such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the
terms thereof or the Financing Parties have confirmed in writing that such
Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing, (iii) the Company irrevocably
(for the two (2) Business Day period described in the following clause (iv))
has notified Parent in writing that all of the conditions in _Section 7.2
_have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms are required to be satisfied at the Closing, but all such conditions
are then capable of being satisfied) and that the Company is ready, willing
and able to consummate the Closing if specific performance is granted and the
Debt Financing is funded, and (iv) Parent failed to consummate the Closing
within two (2) Business Days following the date the Closing was required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated, other than the Termination Fee (plus any Collection Costs) or any
amounts contemplated by _Section 10.8(c)_ , no Company Releasing Related Party
shall have the right to seek, obtain or be entitled to money damages (whether
at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from any of Parent or
Parent Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing
Commitment or in respect of any other agreement, theory of law or otherwise
including for any breach, loss or damage under or related to this Agreement
other than specifically set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_.While the Company may
pursue both (x) a grant of specific performance prior to the Closing pursuant
to _Section 10.8_ and the amounts contemplated by _Section 10.8(c)_ , on the
one hand, and (y) the payment of the Termination Fee (plus any Collection
Costs, as applicable) pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ , on the other hand, under
no circumstances shall the Company or any other Company Releasing
Related Party be entitled to receive both (1) a grant of specific performance
and the amounts contemplated by _Section 10.8(c)_  and (2) all or any portion
of the Termination Fee (plus any Collection Costs, as applicable); _provided_
; _however_ , that, in the event Parent is compelled to consummate the
Closing pursuant to a valid Order granting specific performance made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and Parent fails to so consummate
the Closing notwithstanding such Order, then the Termination Fee would remain
available to the Company in lieu of specific performance and the consummation
of the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (x) in no event shall the
Company or any other Person be entitled to enforce, seek to enforce, or seek
the remedy of specific performance with respect to Parent's rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments against the Debt Financing Sources or (y) be
entitled to specific performance or other equitable remedies (or to seek
specific performance or other equitable remedies) to cause Parent to effect
the Closing if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded
at the Closing if the transactions completed by this Agreement shall be
consummated at the Closing).

  



  

   

105

 



    



  

(c)  To the extent that any Party brings any Legal Proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement prior to the Closing, the Outside Date will automatically be
extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day after such Legal Proceeding
is no longer pending or (ii) such other date established by the Governmental
Entity presiding over such Legal Proceeding. In the event that any aggrieved
Party or Parties prevail in any final and unappealable judgment of any Legal
Proceeding commenced to enforce the terms of this _Section 10.8_ all fees,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs,
incurred by such aggrieved Party or Parties in such Legal Proceeding will
be reimbursed by the non-prevailing Party.

  



  

10.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule is incorporated
herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though completely set
forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule has been arranged for purposes of

any obligation, item or matter not described therein or included in
the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

Agreement.

10.10   _Appointment of the Stockholder Representative._

  



  

(a)  By executing a Stock Letter of Transmittal or the Company
Written Consent or, in the case of a Company Optionholder, participating in
the Mergers and receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive
the consideration payable in connection with the Mergers, each Company
Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed,
effective from and after the date hereof, the Stockholder Representative as
the representative, agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of
each Stockholder to act as the Stockholder Representative for all purposes in
connection with this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto with full
power and authority to take all actions under this Agreement and any other
agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  The Stockholder Representative shall have the authority to
take any and all actions it believes are required, permitted, necessary,
desirable or appropriate under this Agreement or any agreement ancillary
hereto, including giving and receiving any notice or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement, interpreting all of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, authorizing payments to be made with respect hereto or
thereto, conducting negotiations with Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub II or
any Surviving Company and their respective agents regarding such claims,
dealing with Parent and any Surviving Company under this Agreement, taking
any other actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement, and engaging
counsel, accountants or other representatives in connection with the
foregoing matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company Equityholders authorize the Stockholder Representative to act for and
on behalf of the Company Equityholders as if the Company Equityholders were
acting on their own behalf, including:

  



  

(i) taking any and all actions as the Stockholder
Representative may, in its sole discretion, deem necessary or advisable in
respect of: (A) waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties
of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (B) taking such
other action as the Stockholder Representative is authorized to take under
this Agreement (including executing and delivering any documents and incurring
any costs and expenses, in each case, on behalf of the Company
Equityholders); (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making all
determinations required under this Agreement; (D) making any and all
determinations and taking all such actions which may be required or permitted
in connection with the implementation of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or to
otherwise carry out the responsibilities of the Stockholder Representative
contemplated by this Agreement or any Transaction Documents, including any
waiver of any obligation of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any
Surviving Company;

  



  

   

107

 



    



  

(ii) giving and receiving notices, documents and
communications given or to be given to or by the Company Equityholders under
or in connection with this Agreement and/or any of the Transaction Documents
and accepting service of legal process in connection with any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement;

  



  

(iii)  negotiating, defending, settling, compromising and
otherwise handling and resolving any and all claims and disputes with Parent,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Company (but only from and after the
Closing) and any other Parent Indemnitees arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or the Transaction Documents;

  



  

(iv)  retaining legal counsel, accountants, consultants and
other experts and incurring other expenses in connection with all matters and
things set forth or necessary with respect to this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as
the Stockholder Representative may in its sole discretion deem necessary or
advisable; and

  



  

(v)  making any other decision or election or exercising
such rights, power and authority as are incidental to the foregoing.

  



  

(c)  Upon execution of a Stock Letter of Transmittal or the
Company Written Consent, each Company Equityholder acknowledges and agrees
(i) that upon any delivery by the Stockholder Representative of any waiver,
amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or other document executed by the
Stockholder Representative, such Company Equityholder shall be bound by such
documents as fully as if such Company Equityholder had executed and delivered
such documents and (ii) to be bound by the provisions set forth in this 
_Section 10.10_ as if they were a party to this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time. Upon
the resignation, death, disability or incapacity of the initial
Stockholder Representative, then such Person as is appointed by the Company
Equityholders who held a majority of the voting power of the Company Capital
Stock immediately prior to the Closing shall become the Stockholder
Representative; _provided_ , that no appointment of a successor shall be
effective prior to the delivery to Parent of written notice thereof from such
Company Equityholders.

  



  

(e) In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or instrument
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and (ii) assume that any Person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so. Any and all actions taken or not taken,
exercises of rights, power or authority and any decision or determination
made by the Stockholder Representative in connection herewith shall be
absolutely and irrevocably binding upon the Company Equityholders as if such
Company Equityholder had taken such action, exercised such rights, power or
authority or made such decision or determination in its individual capacity,
and Parent may rely upon such action, exercise of right, power, or authority
or such decision or determination of the Stockholder Representative as the
action, exercise, right, power, or authority, or decision or determination of
such Company Equityholders, and no Company Equityholder shall have the right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent is hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by the Stockholder
Representative and any acts done by Parent in accordance with any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

  



  

   

108

 



    



  

(f)  The Stockholder Representative (including in respect of
its holding and disbursement of the Representative Expense Amount) will incur
no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Stockholder Representative in connection with the Stockholder
Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from
the Stockholder Representative's fraud or willful misconduct in connection
with this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Stockholder
Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith for any
indirect, punitive or special damages. The Stockholder Representative may, in
all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and
other experts and advisers and shall not be liable for any action or omission
pursuant to the advice of counsel or any other experts or advisers. The
Company Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Stockholder Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Stockholder Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto and for service as the
Stockholder Representative, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred by the Stockholder Representative or any of
its Affiliates and any of their respective managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, members, partners, stockholders, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in
each case, relating to the Stockholder Representative's conduct as
Stockholder Representative; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have been directly caused by the fraud or willful misconduct
of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will
reimburse the Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such fraud or willful
misconduct. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of,
or provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable
to, the Company Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder
Representative under this Section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) The Stockholder Representative will be entitled to full
reimbursement for all expenses, disbursements and advances (including service
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts, advisors, consultants, agents
or other representatives, including Affiliates of the Stockholder
Representative) incurred by or on behalf of the Stockholder Representative in
such capacity from the Representative Expense Amount in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Company Equityholders, any such expenses, disbursements
and advances or other Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Stockholder Representative from the Representative Expense Amount and/or
the amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Equityholders;
_provided_ , that while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to
be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the
Company Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such losses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Company Equityholders or otherwise. Funds held as the
Representative Expense Amount need not be invested and shall accrue no
interest. In furtherance of the foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholder Representative shall have the
power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds paid to or
received by it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid to the
Company Equityholders (in the case of the Company Optionholders, through any
Surviving Company) pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing or thereafter
(including to establish such reserves as the Stockholder Representative
determines in good faith to be appropriate for such costs and expenses that
are not then known or determinable). To the extent that the amount included
in the Representative Expense Amount exceeds such expenses, disbursements or
advances, the Stockholder Representative will, at such time as it deems
reasonable in its sole discretion, pay such excess to the Company
Equityholders in accordance with their respective percentages contributed to
the Representative Expense Amount set forth on the Closing Consideration
Schedule; _provided_ , that any of such amount allocable to Company
Optionholders shall be paid to the Second Surviving Company for further
distribution to the Company Optionholders in accordance with the Closing
Consideration Schedule.

  



  

   

109

 



    



  

(h)  The appointment of the Stockholder Representative hereunder
is duly made and irrevocable and any action taken by the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section
10.10_ shall be effective and binding as the action of the Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement.

  



  

10.11   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
of which will constitute one agreement. Execution and delivery of this
Agreement by exchange of facsimile or other electronically transmitted
counterparts bearing the signature of a Party shall be equally as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of such Party.

  



  

10.12   _Further Assurance_. If at any time after the Closing any further

Procter LLP ("Goodwin" ) has acted as counsel to the Company, the Company's
Subsidiaries and the Stockholder Representative and certain of the Company
Equityholders in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b)   Parent hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause
the Surviving Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to consent and
agree to, Goodwin representing the Stockholder Representative and/or any of
the Company Equityholders after the Closing, including with respect to
disputes in which the interests of the Stockholder Representative or a Company
Equityholder may be directly adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Companies and their respective Subsidiaries), and
even though Goodwin may have represented the Company its Subsidiaries and/or
certain of the Company Equityholders in a matter substantially related to any
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company, its
Subsidiaries and/or certain of the Company Equityholders. Parent further
consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the communication by Goodwin
to the Stockholder Representative and/or any Company Equityholder in
connection with any such representation of any fact known to Goodwin arising
by reason of Goodwin's prior representation of the Company, Subsidiaries
and/or certain of the Company Equityholders.

  



  

   

110

 



    



  

(c)  In connection with the foregoing, Parent hereby irrevocably
waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Surviving Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Goodwin's prior
representation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or certain of the Company
Equityholders in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
Goodwin's representation of the Stockholder Representative and/or any Company
Equityholder prior to and after the Closing.

  



  

(d)  Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the
Closing, on behalf of the Surviving Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Goodwin, the Company, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, the Stockholder Representative, any Company Equityholder, or any
of their respective directors, officers, employees or other representatives
to the extent related to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under
this Agreement (collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall be deemed to
be retained and owned collectively by the Company Equityholders, shall be
controlled by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company
Equityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Surviving
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries. All Deal Communications
that are attorney-client privileged (the "Privileged Deal
Communications") shall remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege
and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely
to the Stockholder Representative and the Company Equityholders, shall be
controlled by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company
Equityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, the Surviving
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent, any Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and a third party other than the Stockholder Representative,
any Company Equityholder or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand,
Parent, such Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal
Communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
Parent, any Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative. In the
event that Parent, any Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries is
legally required by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a
copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Deal Communications, Parent shall
immediately (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing (including by making specific reference
to this _Section 10.13(e)_) so that the Stockholder Representative can seek a
protective order and Parent agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to assist therewith.

  



  

   

111

 



    



  

(f)  To the extent that Privileged Deal Communications
maintained by Goodwin constitute property of its clients, only the
Stockholder Representative shall hold such property rights and Goodwin shall
have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any
Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Goodwin, on the one hand, and Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

  



  

(g)  Parent agrees that it will not, and that it will cause each
Surviving Company and each of its Subsidiaries not to, (i) access or use the
Privileged Deal Communications, including by way of review of any electronic
data, communications or other information, or by seeking to have the
Stockholder Representative waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or by
otherwise asserting that Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof has
the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to
obtain the Deal Communications from Goodwin or any other Person. In
furtherance of the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of any provision of
this Agreement if, prior to the Closing, the Company, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, the Stockholder Representative and/or any Company Equityholder,
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or other
representatives, takes any action to protect from access or remove from the
premises of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company (or any
offsite back-up or other facilities) any Deal Communications, including
without limitation by segregating, encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing,
exporting or otherwise taking possession of any Deal Communications.
