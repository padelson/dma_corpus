(which may for convenience be paid by the Stockholder Representative out of the Representative Expense Amount)), on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if closing accounts receivable is the only disputed
item, and Parent claims that closing accounts receivable is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Stockholder
Representative, and the Stockholder Representative contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the independent
accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the cost of such review and
report will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 divided by 500) to the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company
Equityholders) and 40% (i.e., 200 divided by 500) to Parent.</P>

vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock (excluding the Share Consideration)
voting at the stockholders meeting for the removal of the Conversion Restriction (as such term is defined in the Certificate
of Designations) is the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent or any of its

Parent has delivered to Company a true, correct and complete copy of the fully executed debt commitment letter(s) and the fee
letter(s), dated as of the date hereof (the &ldquo;<B>Debt Financing Commitment</B>&rdquo;) (in the case of the fee
letter(s), redacted form removing commercially sensitive information therein, including the fee information and
 &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed to Parent and/or its Affiliates,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth therein
for the purpose, among others, of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses to
be incurred by Parent and/or its Affiliates in connection therewith and for the other purposes set forth therein (the
 &ldquo;<B>Debt Financing</B>&rdquo;, which may also include certain actions to be taken under and in connection with the
Existing Credit Agreement). As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment is valid and in full force and effect, has
not been amended, modified or waived, no such amendment, modification or waiver is pending or contemplated (except for
amendments to add additional financing sources thereto in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitment), and the Debt
Financing Commitment has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent has fully paid or caused to be
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment
that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. The Debt Financing Commitment, in the form so delivered, is a valid, legal,
binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. Assuming the truth and correctness in all material respects
of the Company&rsquo;s representations and warranties made hereunder, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other parties thereto, under the Debt Financing Commitment, or a failure of any condition to the Debt
Financing or otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. Assuming the truth
and correctness of the Company&rsquo;s representations and warranties hereunder, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will fail to timely be satisfied or that the full
amount of the Debt Financing will be unavailable on the Closing Date (taking into account the Marketing Period). As of the
date of this Agreement, Parent is not aware of any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations or
warranties of Parent in the Debt Financing Commitment misleading or inaccurate in any material respect. The Debt Financing
Commitment is not subject to any conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder (including with respect to
the Debt Financing Commitment, pursuant to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions in the related fee letter) to make the full
amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent at the Closing other than as set forth therein (including the payment of
customary fees). The Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions contained in
the Debt Financing Commitment), will be sufficient for Parent to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration (<I>less</I> the
Aggregate Parent Stock Value and <I>less</I> the Aggregate Exercise Price), the Payoff Amount and the Selling Expenses.</P>

will not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the Financing Parties
contemplated by the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing. Parent and its Subsidiaries will not amend, modify or supplement
the Debt Financing Commitment or any related fee letters without the prior written approval of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), in each case, if such amendment, modification or supplement would (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(2) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions that would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or prevent the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, or (3) adversely impact the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against the Financing Parties; <I>provided</I>, that Parent may modify, amend or supplement the Debt Financing
Commitment to (A) correct typographical errors or mistakes, (B) add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities
or titles that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof or amend titles, allocations and fee sharing
arrangements in connection therewith or (C) increase the amount of the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent
shall have the right to reduce the commitments under the Debt Financing Commitment on a dollar-for-dollar basis with the net proceeds
of consummated offerings or other incurrences of any debt for borrowed money incurred after the date of this Agreement for the
purpose of financing payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and other amounts payable by Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Parent is a party. In the event that new commitment letters are
entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment permitted
pursuant to this <U>Section <I>&#8206;</I>6.11</U>, such new commitment letters will be deemed to be a part of the &ldquo;Debt
Financing&rdquo; and deemed to be the &ldquo;Debt Financing Commitment&rdquo; for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent will promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Financing Commitment.
In the event that funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, or any portion thereof, become unavailable to
it on the terms and conditions set forth therein (including, as necessary, any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions), Parent will, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (x) notify the Company in writing thereof, (y) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain substitute financing (i) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder,
(ii) that would not involve any conditions to funding the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt Financing Commitment
and (iii) that would not prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder beyond the Closing
Date required to be effected under this Agreement (the &ldquo;<B>Substitute Financing</B>&rdquo;) and obtain a new financing commitment
letter that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form removing commercially sensitive information
therein, including the fee information and &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions). Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute
Financing, such financing will be deemed to be a part of the &ldquo;Debt Financing&rdquo; and any commitment letter for such Substitute
Financing will be deemed the &ldquo;Debt Financing Commitment&rdquo; for all purposes of this Agreement.</P>

requiring the affirmative vote of such Board Representatives), that such access would reasonably be expected to result in a
conflict of interest with Parent; <I>provided</I>, that such exclusion shall be limited to the portion of the Board of
Directors or committee material or information and/or meeting or written consent that is the basis for such exclusion and
shall not extend to any portion of the Board of Directors or committee material and/or meeting that does not involve or

Parent to effect the Closing, unless (i) all conditions in <U>Sections &#8206;7.1</U> have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are required to be satisfied at the Closing, but all such conditions are then
capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or the Financing
Parties have confirmed in writing that such Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing, (iii) the Company irrevocably (for
the two (2) Business Day period described in the following clause (iv)) has notified Parent in writing that all of the
conditions in <U>Section &#8206;7.2 </U>have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are
required to be satisfied at the Closing, but all such conditions are then capable of being satisfied) and that the Company is

(iv) Parent failed to consummate the Closing within two (2) Business Days following the date the Closing was required to have
occurred pursuant to <U>Section&#8206; 2.2</U>. In the event this Agreement is terminated, other than the Termination Fee

otherwise) from any of Parent or Parent Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment or
in respect of any other agreement, theory of law or otherwise including for any breach, loss or damage under or related to
this Agreement other than specifically set forth in <U>Section 9.2(b)</U>.While the Company may pursue both (x) a grant of
specific performance prior to the Closing pursuant to <U>Section 10.8</U> and the amounts contemplated by <U>Section
10.8(c)</U>, on the one hand, and (y) the payment of the Termination Fee (plus any Collection Costs, as applicable) pursuant
to <U>Section 9.2(b)</U>, on the other hand, under no circumstances shall the Company or any other Company Releasing Related
Party be entitled to receive both (1) a grant of specific performance and the amounts contemplated by <U>Section 10.8(c)</U>
and (2) all or any portion of the Termination Fee (plus any Collection Costs, as applicable); <I>provided</I>; <I>however</I>,
that, in the event Parent is compelled to consummate the Closing pursuant to a valid Order granting specific performance made
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and Parent fails to so consummate the Closing notwithstanding such Order,

Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (x) <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">in
no event shall the Company or any other Person be entitled to enforce, seek to enforce, or </FONT>seek the remedy of specific

Stockholder Representative by the Company Equityholders, any such expenses, disbursements and advances or other
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from the Representative Expense Amount and/or the
amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company

aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Company Equityholders or otherwise. Funds held as the Representative Expense Amount need not be invested and
shall accrue no interest. In furtherance of the foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds paid to or received by
it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid to the Company Equityholders (in the case of the Company Optionholders,
through any Surviving Company) pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing or thereafter (including to establish such reserves
as the Stockholder Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for such costs and expenses that are not then
known or determinable). To the extent that the amount included in the Representative Expense Amount exceeds such expenses,
disbursements or advances, the Stockholder Representative will, at such time as it deems reasonable in its sole discretion,
pay such excess to the Company Equityholders in accordance with their respective percentages contributed to the
Representative Expense Amount set forth on the Closing Consideration Schedule; <I>provided</I>, that any of such amount
allocable to Company Optionholders shall be paid to the Second Surviving Company for further distribution to the Company
Optionholders in accordance with the Closing Consideration Schedule.</P>
