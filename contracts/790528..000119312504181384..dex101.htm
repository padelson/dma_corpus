the contemplated transaction and shall not issue any such press releases or
make any such public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement,

agreement with any national securities exchange or automated quotation system,
in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such
public announcement shall use its Best Efforts to consult in good faith with
the other party before issuing any such press releases or making any such
public announcements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
8.04 shall prevent any party from (a) discussing this Agreement or its
contents or the transactions contemplated hereby with those persons whose
approval, agreement or opinion, as the case may be, is required
for consummation of such particular transaction or transactions, (b) making
internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent with
the parties prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby, (c) enforcing its rights hereunder or (d) communicating with
customers and suppliers and prospective customers and suppliers regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby in a manner that is consistent with the
parties prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby.

or waivers from the Companys lenders, or (2) if such consents or waivers are
not obtained, shall arrange to pay off the Companys debt at Closing. Sellers

assist Purchaser in connection with the foregoing to the extent such
cooperation or assistance is requested by Purchaser.

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the
extent a consent is required under any contract, permit or license of the
Company in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, failure to
secure such consent will not constitute a breach of this Agreement (subject to
the parties obligations to use Best Efforts to obtain such consent set forth
herein). If any such consent is not obtained, Sellers shall, at Sellers
expense, cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement designed to
provide for Purchaser the benefit of any such right, including enforcement of
any and all rights of Sellers or the Company against the other party to any
contract, commitment or other similar agreement arising out of the breach or
cancellation thereof by such party or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 



8.06 Review of Operations. Subject to applicable laws, Purchaser may, prior to
the Closing Date, directly or through its representatives, review, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to Sellers, the
premises and books and records of the Company in order to facilitate

and shall cause their Affiliates to, (a) as promptly as reasonably practicable
amend this Agreement to reflect the Restructuring on mutually acceptable terms

notice to Purchaser if by December 15, 2004, after good faith discussions

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | This Agreement may be terminated by Sellers by written
notice to Purchaser if the transaction has not been consummated by January 31,

certainty of closure at such time) for any reason. In such case, a Break Fee
of US$20 million shall be payable by Purchaser to Sellers, unless the reason

Agreement to be performed at or prior to such date of termination, which
failure to perform is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, within 30
days after the receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such failure (or

warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall not be true and
correct (except for changes permitted by this Agreement and those

without regard to whether the other Seller shall have received payment.

Agreement pursuant to Article 10, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
