v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 29,
2014, is made by and among New Breed Holding Company, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), XPO Logistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Nexus Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and NB Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative for the
Companys securityholders (the " _Representative_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company, and, solely in its capacity as and solely to the extent
applicable, the Representative, shall be referred to herein from time to time
as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties". Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article XII_ below.

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company in a reverse
subsidiary merger transaction on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
each (i) determined that the Merger (as defined below) is fair, advisable and
in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and (ii)
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub are each
recommending to their respective stockholders the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;
and

WHEREAS, the Company expects that within twenty-four (24) hours of the
execution of this Agreement, holders of 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock and holders of 86% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock will adopt and approve this Agreement by execution of
a written consent.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

1.01  _The Merger_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 



1 (b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of
merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware and make all other filings required by the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:

 

(i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration multiplied by the Preferred Share
Common Equivalent; and

 

(ii) the Per Share Additional Merger Consideration multiplied by the Preferred
Share Common Equivalent.

 

The aggregate consideration to which holders of Preferred Stock become
entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.02(a)_ is referred to herein as the "
_Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_."

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:

 

(i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration; and

 

(ii) the Per Share Additional Merger Consideration.

 

The aggregate consideration to which holders of Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Common
Stock Merger Consideration_."

1.03 _Effect on Options_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company or of any Securityholder, (i) each Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not an In-the-
Money Option shall (x) if not previously vested, vest as of the
Effective Time, and (y) automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer
be

 



2  outstanding and cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common
Stock, without any payment of any consideration therefor, subject to Section
1.03(c); and (ii) each In-the-Money Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall (x) if not previously vested, vest as of the
Effective Time, and (y) automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer
be outstanding and cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common
Stock, and in consideration therefor, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Option
Consideration. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take
all actions reasonably necessary in order to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this _Section 1.03_; _provided_ that such actions shall
expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and each of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no force or effect if
this Agreement is terminated.

(b) The Closing Option Consideration payable to the holders of In-the-Money
Options pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ above shall be paid through the
Companys payroll system on the first regular payroll date of the Company on
or following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days following the Closing Date), and any remaining portion of the Option
Consideration payable to the holders of In-the-Money Options and, at the
request of the Representative, other amounts received by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement that are payable to the holders of
In-the-Money Options shall be paid to the Surviving Company for payment
through the Surviving Companys payroll system on the first normal payroll
date of the Surviving Company following each such time as any such remaining
portion of the Option Consideration becomes payable to such holder, if any,
or, following each such time as such amount is received by the Surviving
Company for payment to such holders, as the case may be.

(c) In the event that, after giving effect to adjustments contemplated by
_Section 1.10_ or payments to Securityholders if any, payable pursuant to
_Section 1.05_ or _Section 9.06(b)_, Options that were deemed not to be In-
the-Money Options based on the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration would
have been In-the-Money Options if the payments contemplated thereby had been
effected as of the Closing (or vice versa), then such Option shall be deemed
an In-the-Money Option, and the Representative shall recalculate the Fully
Diluted Shares, the Pro Rata Percentage, the Optionholder Percentage, the
Stockholder Percentage and the resulting changes in amounts payable to all
Securityholders after giving effect to the pro forma changes in treatment of
such holders of Options, and the Representative and the Surviving Company
shall adjust the distributions and payments to be made pursuant to _Section
1.05_, _Section 1.10_ or _Section 9.06(b)_ to reflect such recalculations.

 

1.04 _Exchange of Company Stock_. After the Closing, promptly following
surrender to Parent of a certificate representing share(s) of Company Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ "), together with a duly completed and executed
letter of transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), Parent will pay (or cause to be
paid), in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_, to the holder of such
Certificate the amount payable with respect to such share(s) of Company Stock
as provided in _Section 1.02_, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in the applicable Letter of Transmittal. At
the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of

 



3  Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any shares of
Company Stock presented to the Surviving Company or Parent for any reason
shall be converted into the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to _Section 1.02_ without any interest thereon. None of Parent, the
Surviving Company nor their Affiliates shall be liable to any Securityholder
for any amount paid to any public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar laws. Any amount remaining unclaimed
by Securityholders one (1) year after the Closing Date (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

1.05 _Representative Amount_. Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall
deduct from the Merger Consideration due to the Securityholders, an aggregate
amount equal to $300,000, and such amount shall be delivered by Parent to the
Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders, at the Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the
Representative, to satisfy potential future obligations of the Securityholders
to the Representative, including expenses of the Representative arising from
the defense or enforcement of claims pursuant to _Sections 1.09_ and _11.01_
 (in the aggregate, the " _Representative Amount_ "). The Representative
Amount shall be retained in whole or in part by the Representative for such
time as the Representative shall determine in its sole discretion. If the
Representative shall determine in its sole discretion to return all or any
portion of the Representative Amount to the Securityholders, it shall
distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata portion thereof based on its
Pro Rata Percentage; provided that to the extent a Securityholder is a holder
of In-the-Money Options, the Representative may deposit with the Surviving
Company any portion of such amount payable to such holder of In-the-Money
Options, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company, through the Surviving
Companys payroll system, on the first normal payroll date of the Surviving
Company following such deposit (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days following such deposit), to distribute to each such holder the
amount specified in instructions received from the Representative and, in
such circumstances, the amount distributed to the other Securityholders shall
be reduced accordingly.

 

1.06 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and
restated in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.03_, in accordance with the
provisions thereof and the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Surviving Company shall be amended and restated to be in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_ , until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.03_,
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Company and the DGCL.

 

1.07 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the officers of the Company at
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, each
such initial director and initial officer to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as in
effect from and after the Effective Time.

 



4 1.08 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement
setting forth (a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies as of the Reference Time, (b) a good faith calculation of the
Companys estimate of Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), Funded Debt (the "
_Estimated Funded Debt_ "), Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital_ ") and Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ")
and (c) the Closing Cash Consideration, the Per Share Closing Cash
Consideration and the aggregate Closing Option Consideration (the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations
contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement.

1.09 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver to the Representative (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the
Group Companies as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
and (b) a statement showing the Cash, Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and
Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared and Cash, Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction
Expenses shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties
agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining
Cash, Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses and the
related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 1.09_ is to
measure the amount of Cash, Funded Debt, changes in Net Working Capital and
Transaction Expenses. After delivery of the Closing Statement, the
Representative and its accountants and other representatives shall be
permitted full access at reasonable times to review the Surviving Companys
and its Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers (subject to
the Representative and its representatives entering into any reasonable
undertakings required by Parents accountants in connection therewith) related
to the preparation of the Closing Statement. The Representative and its
accountants and other representatives may make reasonable inquiries of
Parent, the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
accountants and employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements with
the Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and
Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If
the Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the
Representative shall deliver to Parent a written statement (an " _Objections
Statement_ ") stating that the Representative believes the Closing Statement
contains mathematical errors or was not prepared in accordance with this
Agreement and specifying in reasonable detail each item that the
Representative disputes (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and the amount in
dispute for each Disputed Item and the reasons supporting the
Representatives positions. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to
Parent within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable
by the Parties. The Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any Disputed Items, but if they do not reach a final resolution within
fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement,
the Representative and Parent shall submit such dispute to the Charlotte, NC
office of Deloitte and Touche LLP, or another nationally recognized independent
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the 

 



5  Representative (the " _Dispute Resolution Arbiter_ "). Any further
submissions to the Dispute Resolution Arbiter must be written and delivered to
each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only
those items and amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as
Disputed Items. The Dispute Resolution Arbiters determination shall be based
solely on the definitions of Cash, Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and
Transaction Expenses contained herein and the provisions of this Agreement,
including this _Section 1.09_. The Representative and Parent shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Arbiter to
resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable in amounts between the
disputed amounts set forth in the Closing Statement and the Objections
Statement. Further, the Dispute Resolution Arbiters determination shall
be based solely on the presentations by Parent and the Representative that
are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the
dispute by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be final and binding on and
non appealable by the Parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based
upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example,
if the Representative claims Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the
amount determined by Parent, and Parent contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Representative, and if the Dispute Resolution Arbiter
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative (for the
benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs
and expenses of arbitration shall be allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300
÷ 500) to Parent and forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders).

1.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

 

(a) If the Final Cash Consideration is greater than the Closing Cash
Consideration, (i) Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of the Final Cash
Consideration) pay (A) to the Representative an amount equal to such
difference multiplied by the Stockholder Percentage, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Representative,
for the benefit of the Securityholders that are not Optionholders, and the
Representative shall distribute to each Securityholder that is not an
Optionholder its pro rata portion thereof based on its Pro Rata Percentage,
and (B) the Surviving Company (for distribution to the holders of the In-the-
Money Options) an amount equal to such difference multiplied by the
Optionholder Percentage, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Surviving Company, for the benefit of
the holders of In-the-Money Options; and (ii) the Representative and Parent
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Representative the funds in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account for the benefit of the Securityholders, and the
Representative shall distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata portion
thereof based on its Pro Rata Percentage. In no event, absent fraud, shall
the amount paid by Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.10(a)_ be greater than
an amount equal to the sum of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and
the amount, if any, remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account as of the
date of any payment pursuant to this _Section 1.10_.

 



6 (b) If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash
Consideration, Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent
the absolute value of such difference (the " _Shortfall Amount_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one (1) or more accounts designated
by Parent to the Representative. The instructions to the Escrow Agent shall
provide that the Shortfall Amount shall be paid (i) first, from the funds
available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (ii) second, if
the Shortfall Amount exceeds the funds available in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, from the funds available in the Indemnification
Escrow Account. In the event that the funds available in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account are in excess of the Shortfall Amount (such excess,
the " _Escrow Excess Amount_ "), the Representative and Parent shall
simultaneously with the delivery of the instructions described in the first
sentence of this _Section 1.10(b)_, deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Representative the Escrow Excess Amount for
the benefit of the Securityholders, and the Representative shall distribute
to each Securityholder its pro rata portion thereof based on its Pro Rata
Percentage. Absent fraud, the Securityholders and the Representative shall not
have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to _Section 1.09_ or this
_Section 1.10_ except to the extent of the funds available in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account and the Indemnification Escrow Account.

 

1.11 _Escrow Accounts._

 

(a) Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall deduct from the Merger
Consideration due to the Securityholders and deposit Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (such amount, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ")
in immediately available funds into an escrow account (which may be a sub-
account, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") to be
established and maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_
attached hereto, with such changes as may be required by the Escrow Agent and
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Representative, to be entered into on
the Closing Date by Parent, the Representative and the Escrow Agent (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). Absent fraud, the amounts contained in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall serve as a security for, and, together
with the Indemnification Escrow Account, the sole and exclusive source of
payment of, Parents rights pursuant to _Section 1.10_, if any.

 

(b) Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall deduct from the Merger
Consideration due to the Securityholders and deposit Forty Million Dollars
($40,000,000) (such amount, the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") in
immediately available funds into an escrow account (which may be a sub-
account, the " _Indemnification Escrow Account_ ") to be established
and maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement. Absent fraud, the amounts contained in the
Indemnification Escrow Account shall serve as a security for, and, (i)
together with the Purchase Price Escrow Account, the sole and exclusive
source of payment of, Parents rights pursuant to _Section 1.10_, if any, and
(ii) the sole and exclusive source of payment of Parents rights pursuant to
_Section 7.03_,  _Section 5.09_ or _Article IX_ , if any.

 



7 (c) All fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Account.

1.12 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share
of Company Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Common Shareholder or Preferred
Shareholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy
or otherwise) in favor of the approval of this Agreement, which Common
Shareholder or Preferred Shareholder complies with all of the provisions of
the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters rights (such
share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Common Shareholder or Preferred
Shareholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of such share
would be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.02_ but rather shall be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders dissenters
rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
automatically be converted into the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, the consideration referred to in _Section 1.02_, pursuant to the
exchange procedures set forth in  _Section 1.04_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of a stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease.
The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demand for payment of
the fair value of any shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of
any such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to any stockholders dissenters
rights and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment under the DGCL. The
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for
appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written
consent of Parent.

 

1.13 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Company, the Representative
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Tax Law. If the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Company,
the Representative or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i)
notify the Representative and Securityholders of any anticipated withholding
(other than backup withholding or withholding of employment taxes), (ii)
consult with the Representative in good faith to determine whether such
deduction and withholding is required under applicable Tax Law, and (iii)
cooperate with the Representative in good faith to minimize the amount of any
applicable withholding.

1.14 _Reference Statement_. _Exhibit F_ sets forth an illustrative
statement prepared in good faith by the Company in cooperation with Parent
setting forth the various line items used (or to be used) in, and illustrating
as of the date set forth therein, the calculation of Cash, Funded Debt and Net
Working Capital prepared and calculated in accordance with this Agreement.

Delaware. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets as they are now being owned, leased and operated and to
carry on its businesses as now conducted, except where the failure to hold
such authorizations, licenses and permits would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
(where such concept is recognized) in every jurisdiction in which it is
required to qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization. Each such Subsidiary has all requisite
corporate, or other legal entity, as the case may be, power and authority and
all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets as they are now being owned, leased and operated and

expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each such Subsidiary is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing (where such concept is recognized) in every jurisdiction
in which it is required to qualify, except in each such case where the failure
to hold such authorizations, licenses and permits or to be so qualified would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent complete copies
of the organizational documents of each such Subsidiary as currently in
effect.

 

3.03 _Authorization; No Breach; Valid and Binding Agreement_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate
action, and, subject to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, no other corporate
proceedings on its part are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement.

 



11 (b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company and its board of
directors have taken all action necessary to exempt under or make not subject
to (i) the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, (ii) any other Takeover Law

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the
Company do not and shall not (i) violate, conflict with, result in any breach
of, or constitute a default under any of the provisions of the Organizational
Documents of the Company or the certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
require any consent of or other action by any Person or by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under, constitute a default or an event that, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or
cause or permit termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit under, any provision of any
Contract or any material Permit affecting the assets or business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate in any material respect any Law or

respective properties or assets are bound or affected, (iv) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien other than Permitted Liens on any
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except where
the failure of any of the representations and warranties contained in clauses

or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

(d) Assuming that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the
other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting

unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 (the " _Latest

_Financial Statements_ ") (i) have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) have been prepared from and
are in accordance with the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (iii) present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the
Group Companies (taken as a whole) as of the times and for the periods
referred to therein, subject in the case of the unaudited financial statements
to (i) the absence of footnote disclosures and other presentation items and
(ii) changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments that are not, in the
aggregate, material to the unaudited financial statements. The Company has
provided Parent with true, complete and correct copies of the Financial
Statements in _Schedule 3.05(a)_. 

 



14 (b) There are no Liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet, except (i)
Liabilities disclosed in _Schedule 3.05(b)_ , (ii) Liabilities reflected or

material to, its business (the " _Assets_ "), except for inventory sold
following the date of the Financial Statements in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, in each case, free and clear of any
Lien, except for Permitted Liens. Any Permitted Liens on the Assets,
individually or in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the
current use of any such Asset by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
materially detract from the value of any such Asset. The Assets constitute all
of the material properties and assets used or held for use for the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Assets are sufficient in
all material respects for the conduct of the respective businesses, activities
and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

or, with respect to the foregoing clauses, _(y)_ ); and

(c) there has not been any fact, circumstance, development, event, condition,
occurrence or change that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,

leases, licenses, subleases and occupancy agreements, together with any
material amendments thereto (the " _Real Property Leases_ "), with respect to
all real property leased, licensed, subleased or

 



15  otherwise used or occupied by the Group Companies as of the date hereof (the
" _Leased Real Property_ "). The Real Property Leases are in full force and
effect, and a Group Company holds a valid and existing leasehold interest
under each such Real Property Lease, subject to proper authorization and
execution of such lease by the other party and the application of any
bankruptcy or creditors rights Laws, and subject to Permitted Liens. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies

any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not
required to be furnished under ERISA), (iii) the most recent annual
financial report and/or the most recent actuarial report, if any, (iv) any
material employee communications, and (v) the most recent determination letter
from the IRS, if any. The Company Employee Benefit Plans are and have been

contributions required to be made to any Company Employee Benefit Plan, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
such plan, have been timely made or paid in full or properly accrued and
reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet prior to the date
hereof, in accordance with the provisions of each of the Company Employee
Benefit Plans, applicable Law and GAAP.

(b) No Group Company by reason of its affiliation with any member of such
Group Companys " _Controlled Group_ " (defined as any organization which is
a member of a controlled group of organizations within the meaning of Section

reasonably expected to incur, any Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other Liability
imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Company Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter or can rely on an opinion letter as to its qualification and, to the
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure

with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan that would reasonably be
likely to result in material liability to the Group Companies. No Company
Employee Benefit Plan is (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA or 

 



21  (ii) a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and
neither any Group Company nor any member of its Controlled Group has at any

any material liability or obligation in respect of, any such arrangement.

except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the
Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(d)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase
the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer
or director of any Group Company, or result in any limitation on the right of
any Group Company to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
from any Company Employee Benefit Plan or related trust.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(e)_ , no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by any Group
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely
as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with
any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. Each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is or was a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (a
" _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") has been operated in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code. No
arrangement exists with respect to a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
that would result in income inclusion under Section 409A(b) of the Code.

 

(f) All Company Employee Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in all material
respects in accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are
intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all requirements for such
treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-
reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon

policies of the Group Companies are in full force and effect, no notice of
cancellation or non-renewal of such policies has been received, and there is
no existing breach, default or event which, with or without notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or default or permit
termination or modification of any such policies. Since January 1, 2011, each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has maintained insurance coverage
consistent in all material respects with the insurance policies maintained by
the Group Companies as of the date hereof. Since January 1, 2011, the Company

Subsidiaries has received any written communication, or to the knowledge of

force and effect and are being complied with in all material respects. There
has been no material violation, material default, cancellation or revocation,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any threatened cancellation or
revocation, of any Permit. None of the Permits will be terminated or impaired
or become terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent that any of the foregoing may occur
solely as a result of the Company being owned by Parent, Parents equity
owners or their Affiliates. As of the date of this Agreement, there has been
no decision by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company not to renew any
Permit relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

shall cause its Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the third party to which the confidentiality obligation is owed to consent to
the disclosure). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,

shall not require agreeing to any obligations or accommodations (financial or
otherwise) binding on a Group Company in the event the Closing does not occur.

5.03 _shall limit, expand or otherwise modify in any way any efforts standard
explicitly applicable to any of the Companys obligations under this

recapitalization, (ii) any purchase of a significant portion of the
outstanding Company Stock or (iii) any merger, sale of all or a significant

the Company or the Representative in connection with Securityholder
communications related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company and the Representative shall, and shall cause their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, Affiliates and other

date hereof, the Company shall instruct each Person (other than Parent and
Merger Sub and their representatives) in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement within the prior twelve (12) months in connection with any actual
or potential proposal by such person to acquire the Company (or any portion
thereof) to promptly return or destroy all such information.

 

5.05 _Payoff Letters and Lien Releases_. The Company shall, or shall have
caused its applicable Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take other
actions required to terminate the commitments in respect of the Existing

satisfactory to Parent from all financial institutions and other Persons to
which the Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement is owed, or the
applicable agent, trustee or other representative on behalf of such Persons,

fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs or other outstanding and unpaid obligations related to the
Existing Credit Agreement as of the Closing Date (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") and

Agreement, and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours, the Company shall
deliver to Parent the Written Consent.

5.07 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the

a material breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in

breach. No information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ shall be
deemed to cure any material breach of any representation, warranty,
or covenant made in this Agreement.

 



34 5.08 _Section 280G Approval_. To the extent necessary to avoid the
application of Section 280G of the Code and the applicable final Treasury
regulations and rulings thereunder, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) obtain waivers
from each Person who has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result
of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that

meaning of Section 280G of the Code and as to which such Person waives his or
her rights to some or all of such payments and/or benefits (the " _Waived 280G
Benefits_ ") applicable to such Person so that all remaining payments and/or
benefits applicable to such Person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), and (ii) following
the execution of the waivers described in clause (i), solicit the approval of
the stockholders of the Company to the extent required under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of any Waived 280G Benefits pursuant to a vote
intended to meet the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the regulations thereunder, and that shall be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and Merger Sub. To the extent any of the Waived 280G
Benefits were not approved by the equity holders of the Company as
contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.

vote of the stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.08_ and that either (A) the
requisite number of votes were obtained with respect to the Waived 280G
Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (B) that the 280G Approval was not
obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made
or provided.

representatives with access (for the purpose of examining and copying

business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the books and records of the Group
Companies with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date, including with respect to any Tax audits, Tax Returns, insurance claims,

records of any Group Company for any period prior to the Closing Date without
first giving reasonable prior notice to the Representative and offering to
surrender to the Representative such books and records or any portion thereof
which Parent or the Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

 

6.02 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date of this Agreement
Parent has knowledge of any fact or condition that constitutes a material
breach of any representation or warranty made in Article IV or any covenant
that would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ or  _Section
8.02(b)_, as applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, Parent
shall disclose to the Company such breach. No information provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.02_ shall be deemed to cure any breach of
any representation, warranty, or covenant made in this Agreement.

6.03 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and each of their respective Subsidiaries to, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who 

 



38  becomes prior to the Closing, an officer, director or employee of a Group
Company (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Party_"), against all Losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses, Liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid
in settlement of or in connection with any claim, Action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of the fact that such Person is or was an officer, director or employee of a
Group Company, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts
or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the same extent that
such Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses
as of the date hereof by the Group Companies pursuant to their respective
organizational documents and indemnification agreements of the Company, if
any, in existence on the date hereof with any DandO Indemnified Party.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing and at all times subject
to applicable Law, (i) Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit any
Group Company or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) amend or
modify in any way adverse to the DandO Indemnified Parties, or to the
beneficiaries thereof, the exculpation and indemnification provisions
set forth in the organizational documents of the Group Companies and (ii)
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by or on behalf of the
Company as of the date hereof (the " _Current Policies_ ") ( _provided_ that
Parent may substitute such policies with a substantially comparable insurer of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent that such premiums exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by or on
behalf of the Company for the Current Policies (the " _Premium Amount_ "), and
if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium
Amount, then Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing and in
satisfaction of Parents foregoing obligations under this _Section 6.03_,
each of Parent and the Company shall be permitted to purchase (at Parents
expense, and without duplication) a six (6) year "tail" prepaid directors
and officers liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail_"), effective as of
the Closing, providing, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the
coverage and amounts, and terms and conditions, contemplated by the foregoing
sentence of this _Section 6.03(b)_; provided, that the Company shall not pay
an aggregate amount for such DandO Tail in excess of the Premium Amount. If such
premiums for such DandO Tail would require an expenditure than exceeds the
Premium Amount, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation may obtain, in
satisfaction of the foregoing, a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. From and after the Closing, Parent
shall (and/or shall cause the Group Companies or its other Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as applicable, to) continue to honor its obligations under any
such insurance procured pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_, and shall not
cancel (or permit to be canceled) or take (or cause to be taken) any action or
omission that would reasonably be expected to result in the cancellation
thereof.

 



39 (c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns proposes to (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
Parent or the Surviving Company shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made prior to or concurrently with the
consummation of such transaction so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall, from and after the
consummation of such transaction, honor the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.03_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and the Effective Time and (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party and his or her
successors, heirs and representatives and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company and (ii) are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

Agreement and the Closing Date, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of
the Closing conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_); provided that such
efforts shall not require agreeing to any obligations or accommodations
(financial or otherwise) binding on Parent or Merger Sub in the event the
Closing does not occur. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing
contained in this  _Section 6.04_ shall limit, expand or otherwise modify in
any way any efforts standard explicitly applicable to any of Parents and/or
Merger Subs respective obligations under this Agreement.

 

6.05 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Parent and Merger Sub each hereby
agrees that from the date hereof until the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of the Agreement, it is not authorized to, and shall not (and
shall not permit any of its representatives or Affiliates to) contact and

any Group Company regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, without the
prior written consent of the Companys Chief Executive Officer or the
Representative.

 

6.06 _Financing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate
and obtain the Debt Financing (or in the event any portion or all of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, together with the remaining Financing, if any, and any
other sources available to Parent and Merger Sub, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) from the same or other sources
(such portion from sources other than any source providing the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, the "
_Alternate Financing_ ")) as and to the extent required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt written notice of any material breach by any party to any Debt
Financing Commitment of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware.

 



40 6.07 _Parent s Solvency_. If Parent is obtaining financing from a third party
in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, Parent shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Company and the Representative copies of any
solvency opinions or similar materials obtained by Parent from third parties
in connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to the extent contractually permitted by the issuer of such
opinion. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the firms
issuing any such solvency opinions to allow the Company to rely thereon.

employees who continue to be employed by the Company (collectively, "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with the same salary or hourly wage rate
as provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date and with employee benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided under the Company Employee Benefit
Plans in which such Continuing Employees participated as of the date of this

plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which the Continuing Employees
commence to participate on or after the Closing Date (collectively, the " _New
Plans_ "), except (1) for New Plans as to which employees who are similarly
situated to the Continuing Employees are not provided such service credit or
(2) as would result in duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Continuing Employee under any Company Employee Benefit Plan or under any other
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement as of the
date on which commencement of participation in such New Plan begins, and (y)
cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid
during the calendar year in which commencement of participation in such New
Plan begins and prior to such commencement of participation by any Continuing
Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes
of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of
pocket provisions under such New Plan in the year of initial participation.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing,
any Group Company) shall be responsible for any Controlled Group Liability,
and the funds available in the Indemnification Escrow Account, if any, shall
be the sole source of recovery with respect to any Controlled Group Liability.

Employment_. Nothing contained in this Article VII, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any employee any right to continued employment for any
period or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan or
Company Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. Further, this _Article VII_ shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this _Article VII_ , express or implied, is intended to confer upon

the Representative objects to any item or items in such proposed Tax Returns
at least 15 days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax
Return, Parent shall revise such Tax Returns to reflect the comments of the
Representative to the extent Parent agrees with such comments. In the event
that the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve such comments at
least 10 days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax
Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter prior

date) or the failure of the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
2.02(j)(iii)_ to be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date; (C) any
Taxes arising out of, attributable to, relating to or resulting from any

its covenants or agreements contained herein; and (D) costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item in
clauses (A)-(C) of this _Section 7.03(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for
any such Taxes to the extent a liability for such Taxes was reflected in the
Final Closing Working Capital.

 

(c) _Straddle Period Allocations_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Straddle Period,

(d) _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(i) If any Governmental Entity asserts a Tax Claim, then the party first
receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice
thereof to the other party or parties hereto; provided, however, that the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the party from whom indemnification is
being sought of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
the party from whom indemnification is being sought is materially prejudiced
by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for
such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Governmental Entity.

ARTICLE IX __

 

 _SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions_. The representations and warranties of the Company, the
Representative, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.02(g)_ or _2.02(j)_ shall
survive the Closing until the 12 month anniversary of the Closing (the "
_Survival Termination Date_ ").

9.02 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ , after the Closing Date,
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification solely
from the Indemnification Escrow Account for any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of, relating to
or arising out of:

 

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company in this Agreement to be true and correct on the date hereof and at
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case only as of such date) or the failure of the
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.02(j)(i)_ or  _2.02(j)(iii)_ to
be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date;

(ii) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Representative in this Agreement to be true and correct on the date hereof and
at and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case only as of such date);

 



47 (iii) any breach by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any of
its covenants or agreements contained herein which are to be performed by the
Company or such Subsidiary on or before the Closing Date; and

 

(iv) any breach by the Representative of any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein which are to be performed by the Representative;

_provided_ that the aggregate amount of Losses with respect to which all
Parent Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 9.02(a)_ shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

(b) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to _Section
7.03(b)_ and _Section 9.02(a)_ shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby until the Survival Termination Date; except
for claims for indemnification pursuant to such clauses asserted prior to the
Survival Termination Date in accordance with _Section 7.03_ or _Section
9.03_, which claims shall survive until final resolution thereof.

 

9.03 _Claims_.

(a) Any Parent Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under _Section 9.02
_(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give the Representative (the
Representative, in such capacity, the " _Responsible Party_ ") written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified Party has
determined has given or would be reasonably likely to give rise to a right of
indemnification under _Section 9.02_, within thirty (30) days of such
determination, stating the nature of the claim, to the extent then known by
the Indemnified Party, a good-faith estimate of the Loss and method of
computation thereof, to the extent then reasonably estimable, and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises (it being agreed that the failure to
specify any provision of this Agreement in such Claim Notice shall not
preclude the Indemnified Party from asserting that there has been a breach
of, or inaccuracy in, or failure to perform such provision); _provided_ that
the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is
prejudiced by such failure. If the Responsible Party has disputed a claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.02_ (including any Third-Party Claim) or has
not notified the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the Claim Notice that the Responsible Party disputes or does not dispute
such claim, the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the Responsible
Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such dispute in ninety (90)
days after delivery of a Claim Notice, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant
to the terms of _Sections 13.11_ , _13.15_ and _13.16_.

 

(b) If an Action by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against
any Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto under _Section 9.02_, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Responsible Party of such claims; provided that the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of 

 



48  its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party
is materially prejudiced thereby. Other than in connection with a Third Party
Claim by a Governmental Entity, the Responsible Party shall have the right to
assume, within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, the conduct and
control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, by
sending notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, which notice shall state
that, assuming (x) the facts then presented to the Responsible Party by the
Indemnified Party are true and accurate and (y) no other relevant facts
exist, Responsible Party shall, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.04_, indemnify the Indemnified Party for the Losses that the
Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in
the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided that the Responsible
Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate co-counsel and to participate in the defense as counsel of record, if
applicable, in such action or proceeding (and the parties shall jointly
control the defense), and the Responsible Party shall bear the reasonable
fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) there exists any
actual or reasonably likely conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party
and the Responsible Party in connection with the defense of the Third Party
Claim that would make representation by the same counsel or the counsel
selected by the Responsible Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party (iii) such Third Party Claim is related to or otherwise arises in
connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action, (iv) the amount
at issue in the Third Party Claim exceeds the funds remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account or (v) the resolution of the Third Party Claim
would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the operations
or business of Parent, the Company or their Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such fees, costs and expenses shall only be payable by the
Responsible Party to the extent the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification for such fees and expenses as Losses pursuant to _Section
9.02_, in which case the Responsible Party shall pay such Losses only to the
extent required by _Section 9.02_ and subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.04_.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Responsible Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any
such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Responsible Party if such
Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by
the Responsible Party or from the Indemnification Escrow Account, as the case
may be, for such Third Party Claim. The Responsible Party shall not, except
with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement of a
Third Party Claim that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such Third Party Claim to all
Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all Liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment, (ii)
does not involve only the payment of money damages, (iii) imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party, (iv) includes
any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the Indemnified Party or (v)
involves the payment of money damages in excess of the funds remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account.

 



49 (d) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense
of any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access
during normal business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents
and representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information which have been identified by the Responsible Party as
being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers.

9.04  _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the Parent
Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section
9.02_ are subject to the following limitations, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary:

(a) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses
pursuant to  _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ until the total amount which the Parent
Indemnified Parties would recover under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_, but for this
_Section 9.04(a)_, exceeds Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($4,500,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses in excess of the
Deductible subject to the proviso in _Section 9.02(a)_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to Losses in respect of claims
for breach of representations and warranties related to Company Fundamental
Representations.

 

(b) The sole and exclusive source of recovery in respect of any
indemnification claim made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 9.02 shall be the Indemnification Escrow Amount. In no event shall
(i) any Securityholder or any Affiliate thereof or any other Person have any
direct liability or obligation in respect of any such indemnification claim,
or (ii) the Parent Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover any Losses in
respect of any indemnification claim made pursuant to this _Article IX_ from
any source other than the Indemnification Escrow Account, it being agreed that
on the date the Indemnification Escrow Amount is reduced to zero (0) for any
reason (including due to the release of the Indemnification Escrow Amount from
the Indemnification Escrow Account on the Survival Termination Date), the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no further rights to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_.

(c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_
shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnitee from
any third party with respect thereto.

 

(d) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_
or _Section 7.03(b)_ shall be calculated (i) net of any Tax Benefit actually
realized by the Parent Indemnified Party in the Tax year of the Loss and (ii)
increased by the amount of any Tax Cost incurred by the Parent Indemnified
Party as a result of the receipt or accrual of any indemnification payment.

 



50 (e) For all purposes of this _Article IX_ and _Section 7.03(b_), any
inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement (other than the Companys representations and warranties in
_Sections 3.10(a)_ and _3.07_ ) shall be determined without reference to the
terms " _material_ ," " _Material Adverse Effect_ " and other similar
qualifications as to materiality contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representations and warranties.

 

(f) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article IX_ with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent
such Loss or alleged Loss is actually included as a Liability in the
calculation of the Funded Debt, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in
_Section 9.04_ shall limit any Persons rights to recovery in respect of
fraud.

9.05 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to and without limitation of the
rights of Parent pursuant to _Article I_ and  _Section 13.18_ and the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_, the indemnification terms
set forth in this _Article IX_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses or other claims
relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in any exhibit, Schedule or
certificate delivered hereunder, in each case regardless of the legal theory
under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at Law or in equity, or otherwise,
and the parties hereby agree that no Parent Indemnified Party shall have any
remedy or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing other than as
expressly set forth in this _Section 7.03(b)_, _Section 13.18_ or _Article
IX_ (and subject to the limitations and terms set forth in this _Article IX_
).

 

(b) Parent acknowledges and agrees, on its behalf and on behalf of the Parent
Indemnified Parties, that from and after the Closing, no Parent Indemnified
Party may avoid the limitation on liability set forth in this _Article IX_ by
asserting or threatening any claim against any Person that is not a Party for
breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement. The Parties hereto agree that the
provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits
imposed on the remedies of the Parties with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Securityholders hereunder.

 

9.06 _Indemnification Escrow_.

 

(a) To the extent that any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to any
indemnification payments, such indemnification payments shall be disbursed to
such Parent Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from the Indemnification Escrow Account.

 



51 (b) On the Survival Termination Date, the parties shall provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the
Indemnification Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds
all or a portion of the cash held in the Indemnification Escrow Account, such
that, following such transfer, the amount of cash remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account equals only the amount, if any, of claims for
indemnification under _Section 7.03(b)_ and _Section 9.02(a)_ properly
asserted prior to such date by the Parent Indemnified Parties in writing in
accordance with _Section 7.03_ or this _Article IX_ , as applicable, but not
yet resolved as of the Survival Termination Date (such claims, " _Unresolved
Claims_ ," and such amount of funds to be transferred, the " _Indemnification
Escrow Remainder_ "). Such joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Representative the Indemnification
Escrow Remainder for the benefit of the Securityholders. The Representative
shall distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata portion thereof based on
its Pro Rata Percentage; _provided_ that to the extent a Securityholder is a
holder of In-the-Money Options, the Representative may deposit with the
Surviving Company any portion of such amount payable to such holder of In-the-
Money Options, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company, through the
Surviving Companys payroll system, on the first normal payroll date of the
Surviving Company following such deposit (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days following such deposit), to distribute to each such holder the
amount specified in instructions received from the Representative and, in
such circumstances, the amount distributed to the other Securityholders shall
be reduced accordingly. Upon final resolution of any Unresolved Claim in
respect of which an amounts had been retained (to the extent not utilized to
satisfy valid claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_), the
parties shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
deliver such amount promptly from the Indemnification Escrow Account by wire
transfer of immediately available funds and such amount shall be deemed to
have become Indemnification Escrow Remainder and shall be paid to each
Securityholder in accordance with the process set forth in the preceding
sentence and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) Promptly upon any Person becoming entitled to release of amounts from the
Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to  _Section 7.03(b)_ or this
_Article IX_ or the Escrow Agreement, the parties shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to so release
such amounts.

 

9.07 _Special Damages_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no Person shall be liable to any other Person for, and no Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek or recover under any theory of
liability, any speculative, exemplary, punitive damages or other damages that
are not reasonably foreseeable of such other Person relating to the breach
or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or related hereto, except to the extent included in a Third
Party Claim as to which a Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement.

rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within
or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact
of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is

required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no

any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of contract).

Disclosure Schedules hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed

Party or Parties waiving rights hereunder; provided, however, that after the
receipt of the Shareholder Approval, no amendment to this Agreement shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such further approval by such stockholders. No waiver of any
provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

13.09 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) and other documents executed

between the Parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or

13.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Certain provisions of this Agreement are
intended for the benefit of the Securityholders and shall be enforceable by
the Representative on behalf of the Securityholders; _provided_ that no
Securityholder shall have the right to directly take any action or enforce any

such actions shall be taken solely by the Representative on behalf of the

this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

13.11 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF

THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO (INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES RELATED
PARTIES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT), IN
EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES
AND CONSENTS THAT

 



77  ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY
OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

13.12 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, shall be treated in
all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party hereto or to any
such contract, each other Party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original
forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any
such contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.
This Agreement is not binding unless and until signature pages are executed
and delivered by each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Representative.

13.13  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one
(1) Party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. 

13.14 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the
exhibits and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

13.15 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, Action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware; _provided_ that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not
have jurisdiction, any such suit, Action or proceeding shall be brought
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
or any other court of the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, Action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, Action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, Action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, Action or proceeding may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.03_
shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not bring or

 



78  support any Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source
Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than any federal court of the United States of America
located in, or, if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in
any state court located in, in each case, the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York and (ii) that any such Action shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the application of
the laws of any other State, except to the extent provided in the Debt
Financing Commitment.

 

13.16 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

13.17 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any action, suit or claim for breach of this
Agreement may only be made against, the Parties to this agreement, and
no Non-Recourse Party of a Party to this Agreement shall have any liability
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein. In
addition, none of the Financing Sources Related Parties, in their capacities
as such, will have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any related Debt Financing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any
of the Financing Sources Related Parties hereunder or thereunder; _provided_
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates shall retain all
rights and remedies that they may have against the Financing Sources Related
Parties. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources Related
Parties.

 

13.18 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the rights of each Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate
remedy at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, subject to
and without limiting _Section 13.18(b)_ below (if applicable), such non-
breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to enforce its rights and
the other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an Action or Actions for
damages but also by an Action or Actions for specific performance, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).
Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (x) any
defenses in any Action for an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief, including the defense that the other Parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity and (y) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 



79 (b) To the extent any Party brings any Action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such Action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Action, claim, complaint
or other proceeding.

 

13.19 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP ("
_WF andG_") has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Securityholders
(including Warburg Pincus and its Affiliates) and the Company, its Affiliates
and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that WFandG intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the Securityholders (including Warburg Pincus and
its Affiliates) after the Closing, each of Parent and the Surviving Company
(including on behalf of the Group Companies) hereby waives any conflicts that
may arise in connection with WFandG representing any of the Securityholders
(including Warburg Pincus and its Affiliates) and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, any Group Company or the
transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between any Securityholders (including
Warburg Pincus and its Affiliates) and its Affiliates in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely
to such Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group Companies or
the Surviving Company). Accordingly, the Group Companies and the Surviving
Company shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
WFandG relating to engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) the applicable Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies or the Surviving Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group
Companies or the Surviving Company shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the
extent that files of WFandG in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the applicable Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not
the Group Companies or the Surviving Company) shall hold such property rights
and (iii) WFandG shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies or the
Surviving Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
WFandG and any of the Group Companies or otherwise; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not extend to any communication or file not involving the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
this Agreement or any other agreements contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of the Group Companies and a third party (other than
a party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the
Closing, the Surviving Company (including on behalf of the Group Companies)
may asset the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by WFandG to such third party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
neither the Surviving Company nor any of the Group Companies may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Representative, on behalf
of the Securityholders.
