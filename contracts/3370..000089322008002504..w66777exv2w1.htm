 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of August 27, 2008, among RICOH COMPANY, LTD., a Japanese corporation (" _Parent_ "), KEYSTONE ACQUISITION, INC., an Ohio corporation (" _Sub_ ") and a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and IKON OFFICE SOLUTIONS, INC., an Ohio corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to merge Sub into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, without par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned by Parent, Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive $17.25 in cash; 

   

 WHEREAS Parent wishes to retain certain Company Employees (as defined herein) following the Closing and to continue to benefit from their services and, accordingly, as a condition to Parents willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that the Company enter into retention agreements with such Company Employees that provide for certain payments and benefits following the Closing and will be void and of no further force or effect in the event that the Closing does not occur; and 

   

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I  

  

 _The Merger_   

  

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day after the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the OGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the OGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other date, after the date of the filing of the Certificate of Merger, as Parent and Sub and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the OGCL, including, without limitation, Section 1701.82 thereof. 

   

 SECTION 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations._  (a) The articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A (or such other form as may be required by applicable Law), and, as so amended, such articles of incorporation shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The code of regulations of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

ARTICLE II  

  

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub: 

    

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ (i) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and 2.01(d), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive $17.25 in cash, without interest. 

   

 (ii) The cash payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. 

   

 (iii) As provided in Section 2.02(g), the right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax laws. 

   

 (d) _Dissent Rights._ (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required by the OGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any shareholder who was a record holder of the Company Common Stock as to which such shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of the Company Shareholders Meeting, and who files with the Company within 10 days after such vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting a written demand to be paid the fair cash value for such shares of Company Common Stock that have not been voted in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), unless and until such shareholder fails to demand payment properly or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such shareholders rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If any such shareholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses any such rights as a dissenting shareholder, that shareholders Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into only the right to receive at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration, without interest. From and after the Effective Time, each shareholder who has asserted rights as a dissenting shareholder as provided in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of 

   ##### 

  

    

the OGCL shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted under those
Sections of the OGCL. 

   

 (ii) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of each shareholder who asserts rights as a dissenting shareholder within three business days of receipt of such shareholders written demand delivered as provided in Section 1701.85(A)(2) of the OGCL. Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any rights of a dissenting shareholder asserted under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. 

  

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing Company Common Stock. Parent shall provide, or take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent immediately following the Effective Time all the cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b)  _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore 

   ##### 

  

   

represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock; _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ _that_ any investment of such cash must be limited to direct, short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States government. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including any payments made in respect of the Dissenting Shares) to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Performance Unit 

   ##### 

  

   

Awards, Company RSUs, Company DSUs or Company Stock Equivalents, such amounts
as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Performance Unit
Awards, Company RSUs, Company DSUs or Company Stock Equivalents, as the case
may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE III  

  

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_   

  

 The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that, except as expressly disclosed in reasonable detail in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and publicly available after October 1, 2006 and no later than five business days prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") (excluding, in each case, any disclosures in the Company SEC Documents set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to the extent they are forward looking statements or forward-looking or predictive in nature) or in the applicable section of the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent and Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "): 

   

 SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ The Company and each Significant Company Subsidiary (as defined below) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease, operate or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and are not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Significant Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of its properties make such 

   ##### 

  

   

qualification necessary or the failure to so qualify has had or is reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation
of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the
" _Company Articles_ "), and the Code of Regulations of the Company,
as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Code
of Regulations_ "), and the comparable articles and organizational documents
of each Significant Company Subsidiary, in each case as amended through the
date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Significant
Company Subsidiary_ " means any subsidiary of the Company that constitutes
a significant subsidiary within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of
the SEC, and a " _Company Subsidiary_ " means any subsidiary of the
Company. 

   

 SECTION 3.02. _Significant Company Subsidiaries; Equity Interests._  (a) The Company Disclosure Letter lists each Significant Company Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Significant Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are as of the date of this Agreement owned by the Company, by another Company Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ").

predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its

recognized to any extent that such recognition would result in any

subsidiaries shall be required to provide credit for benefit accrual purposes

 SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than Section 3.15, Section 4.07, the second to last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.07, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and except that no such termination shall

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

   

 SECTION 8.04. _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.03, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
