AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

Section 1\. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. By virtue
of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place at the Northern California offices of outside counsel to
Parent, on a date to be designated jointly by Parent and the Company, which
shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6 and 7 (other than the conditions, which by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of
such conditions). The date on which the Closing actually takes place is
referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of
the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company and concurrently with or as
soon as practicable following the Closing shall be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the
time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be designated jointly by
Parent and the Company and specified in such certificate of merger (the time
as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective
Time"). 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

 

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to read as set
forth in Exhibit B.

(b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to read as set forth in Exhibit C.

 

(c) The directors and officer of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be so held and no consideration
shall be paid or payable in respect thereof;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding and no consideration shall be paid or
payable in respect thereof; 

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject
to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c) and 1.5(d), each share of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with any
associated Rights) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.42 of a
share of Parent Common Stock (such number as may be adjusted in accordance
with Section 1.5(b), the "Exchange Ratio"); and

(iv) each share of the Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, or a record date with respect
to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Exchange Ratio
shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 



2 (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other Contract with the Company or under which the
Company has any rights, including any shares of Company Restricted Stock
then: (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares
of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture and other terms and conditions as
applied to such shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including vesting conditions; and (ii) the certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right
set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract.

(d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of
such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6) or non-
certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book entry ("Book
Entry Shares"), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the
average closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market for the 10 most recent trading days that Parent Common Stock has
traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the date the Merger becomes
effective.

 

1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) except
as provided in Section 1.5(a)(i) or Section 1.5(a)(ii), all shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all
holders of Book Entry Shares or of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the
right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section
1.5, cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(c); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") or a Book Entry Share is presented to
the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share
shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

 

1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select The Bank of New York,
Parents transfer agent or another bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the
"Exchange Agent") and shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed
by the Exchange Agent. At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent: (i) certificates representing
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5; and (ii)
cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 1.5(d). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so
deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

 



3 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates
or Book Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and the Company shall reasonably approve prior to the
Effective Time (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for certificates
representing Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to Section 1.7(c). Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.5, cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(c); and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
as contemplated by Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(c)). If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition to the issuance of any certificate representing
Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver
a bond (in such sum as Parent and the Company reasonably agree to direct) as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such
holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares in
accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled,
subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares as of the date that is one
year after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and be entitled to receive from Parent,
satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



4 (e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Body, (i) such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid, and (ii) Parent, the Exchange Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall promptly deliver the
amounts so deducted or withheld to the applicable taxing or other authority.

(f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with

Opnext Corporations is in compliance in all material respects with all
material terms and requirements of each grant, incentive and subsidy
identified or required to be identified in Part 2.14(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions,

of time) give any Person the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend,

(f) There are no Contracts relating to allocating or sharing of Taxes to which
any Opnext Corporation is a party (other than contracts solely among the

Opnext Corporation), or is currently under any contractual obligation to
indemnify any Person with respect to any amounts of such Persons Taxes
(except for customary agreements not primarily related to Taxes) or is a party
to any Contract providing for payments by an Opnext Corporation with respect
to any amount of Taxes of any other Person (other than contracts solely among
the Opnext Corporations or contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business that do not primarily relate to Taxes).

(g) No Opnext Corporation has constituted either a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of
the Code within the past two years. No Opnext Corporation is or has been a

(j) No Opnext Corporation has participated in, or is currently participating
in, a "Listed Transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

2.16 Employee and Labor Matters; Benefit Plans.

(a) Except as set forth in Part 2.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or

organization or works council representing any of its employees and there are
no labor organizations or works councils representing, purporting to represent
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, seeking to represent any employees of
any of the Opnext Corporations. Since January 1, 2010, there has not been any
strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor
dispute, question concerning representation, union organizing activity, or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any threat thereof, affecting any of the
Opnext Corporations or any of their employees. There is not now pending, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has threatened to commence, any
such strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor
dispute, question regarding representation or union organizing activity or any
similar activity or dispute. There is no claim or grievance pending or, to

related thereto), privacy right, labor dispute, safety, retaliation,
immigration or discrimination matters involving any Company Associate,
including charges of unfair labor practices or harassment complaints.

 

(c) The Company has delivered or Made Available to Parent an accurate and
complete list, by country and as of the date hereof, of: (i) each Company
Employee Plan; (ii) each Company Employee Agreement; and (iii) all work rules
(together with all policies and supplements related thereto) and employee
manuals and handbooks relating to employees of any Opnext Corporation. None
of the Opnext Corporations intends, and none of the Opnext Corporations has
committed, to establish or enter into any new Company Employee Plan or Company
Employee Agreement, or to modify any Company Employee Plan or
Company Employee Agreement (except to conform any such Company Employee Plan
or Company Employee Agreement to the requirements of any applicable Legal
Requirements or as required by this Agreement).

 

(d) The Company has delivered or Made Available to Parent accurate and
complete copies of: (i) all documents setting forth the terms of each Company
Employee Plan and each Company Employee Agreement, including all amendments
thereto and all related trust documents; (ii) the three most recent annual
reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached
thereto), if any, required under applicable Legal Requirements in connection
with each Company Employee Plan; (iii) if the Company Employee Plan is subject
to the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA, the most recent
annual and periodic accounting of Company Employee Plan assets, if any; (iv)
the most recent summary plan description together with the summaries of
material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA or any similar
Legal Requirement with respect to each Company Employee Plan; (v) all
material written Contracts relating to each Company Employee Plan, including
administrative service agreements and group insurance contracts; (vi) all
discrimination tests required under the Code for each Company Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the three most
recent plan years; and (vii) the most recent IRS determination or opinion
letter issued with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

 



21 (e) Each of the Opnext Corporations and Company Affiliates has performed in
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
each Company Employee Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been
established and maintained in all material respects in accordance with its
terms. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code. All Company
Pension Plans required to have been approved by any Governmental Body have
been so approved, no such approval has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred to the
Knowledge of the Company since the date of the most recent approval or
application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that would
reasonably be expected to materially affect any such approval relating thereto
or materially increase the costs relating thereto. Each Company Employee Plan
intended to be tax qualified under applicable Legal Requirements is so tax
qualified, and no event has occurred and no circumstance or condition exists
that could reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any
such Company Employee Plan. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt
under a statutory or administrative exemption, has occurred with respect to
any Company Employee Plan. There are no audits or inquiries pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by the IRS, the DOL or any other
Governmental Body with respect to any Company Employee Plan. None of the
Opnext Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any
material penalty or Tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan under
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any
material penalty or Tax under applicable Legal Requirements with respect to
any Company Employee Plan. Each of the Opnext Corporations and Company
Affiliates has made all contributions and other payments required by and due
under the terms of each Company Employee Plan. No Company Employee Agreement
or Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section 409A of the
Code could reasonably be expected to result in gross income
inclusion pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

(f) None of the Opnext Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any: (i)
Company Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; (ii) "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in
Section 413 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is or has been funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association"
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. None of the Opnext
Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in or contributed to any Company Pension Plan in which
stock of any of the Opnext Corporations or any Company Affiliate is or was
held as a plan asset. The fair market value of the assets of each funded
Company Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Company Foreign
Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Company
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect
to all current and former participants in such Company Foreign Plan according
to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Company Foreign
Plan, and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. There are no
liabilities of the Opnext Corporations with respect to any Company Employee
Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements
of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

 

(g) None of the Opnext Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, maintains,
sponsors or contributes to any Company Employee Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and
that is, in whole or in part, self-funded or self-insured. No Company Employee
Plan provides (except at no cost to the Opnext Corporations or any Company
Affiliate), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the Opnext
Corporations or any Company Affiliate to provide, post-termination or retiree
life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-
termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any
of the Opnext Corporations or any Company Affiliate, none of the Opnext
Corporations nor any Company Affiliate has ever represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Company Associate (either
individually or to Company Associates as a group) or any other Person that
such Company Associate(s) or other Person would be provided with post-
termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health
benefit or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits, except
to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the
Contemplated Transactions will, or could reasonably be expected to, with or
without notice or the lapse of time, result in or give any other Person the
right or option to cause, create, impose or declare: (i) a loss of, or
Encumbrance on, any Parent IP; or (ii) the grant, assignment or transfer to
any other Person of any license or other right or interest under, to or in any

Disclosure Schedule. Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions,
does, will or would reasonably be expected to (with or without notice or lapse
of time) give any Person the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel,
terminate or modify any grant, incentive or subsidy identified or required to
be identified in Part 3.14(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 



40 3.15 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Each of the material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of
the respective Oclaro Corporations with any Governmental Body (the "Oclaro
Corporation Returns"): (i) has been filed on or before the applicable due date
(including any extensions of such due date); and (ii) has been prepared in all
material respects in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. All
amounts shown on the Oclaro Corporation Returns to be due have been timely
paid.

 

(b) The Parent Unaudited Balance Sheet accrues all material liabilities for
Taxes with respect to all periods through the date of the Parent Unaudited
Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP, and none of the Oclaro Corporations has
incurred any material liabilities for Taxes since the date of the Parent
Unaudited Balance Sheet other than in the operation of the business of
the Oclaro Corporations in the ordinary course.

(c) No Oclaro Corporation and no Oclaro Corporation Return is currently under
(or since January 1, 2010 has been under) an audit by any Governmental Body,
and to the Knowledge of Parent, no Governmental Body has delivered to any
Oclaro Corporation since January 1, 2010 a notice or request to conduct a
proposed audit or examination with respect to Taxes. No extension or waiver
of the limitation period applicable to any material Oclaro Corporation Returns
has been granted (by Parent or any other Person), and no such extension or
waiver has been requested from any Oclaro Corporation.

(d) No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
has been threatened against or with respect to any Oclaro Corporation in
respect of any material Tax. There are no unsatisfied liabilities for material
Taxes with respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by
any Oclaro Corporation with respect to any material Tax (other than
liabilities for Taxes asserted under any such notice of deficiency or similar
document which are being contested in good faith by the Oclaro Corporations
and with respect to which reserves for payment have been established on the
Parent Unaudited Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP). There are no liens
for material Taxes upon any of the assets of any of the Oclaro Corporations
except liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable or being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which reserves have been
established in accordance with GAAP. None of the Oclaro Corporations has been,
and none of the Oclaro Corporations will be, required to include any material
adjustment in taxable income for any tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant
to Section 481 or 263A of the Code (or any comparable provision of state or
foreign Tax laws) as a result of transactions or events occurring, or
accounting methods employed, prior to the Closing.

(e) No claim which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in
an obligation to pay material Taxes has ever been made by any Governmental
Body in a jurisdiction where an Oclaro Corporation does not file a Tax Return
that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

(f) There are no Contracts relating to allocating or sharing of Taxes to which
any Oclaro Corporation is a party (other than contracts solely among the
Oclaro Corporations or contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business that do not primarily relate to Taxes). None of the Oclaro
Corporations is liable for Taxes of any other Person (other than another
Oclaro Corporation), or is currently under any contractual obligation to
indemnify any Person with respect to any amounts of such Persons Taxes
(except for customary agreements not primarily related to Taxes) or is a party
to any Contract providing for payments by an Oclaro Corporation with respect
to any amount of Taxes of any other Person (other than contracts solely among
the Oclaro Corporations or contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business that do not primarily relate to Taxes).

 



41 (g) No Oclaro Corporation has constituted either a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of
the Code within the past two years. No Oclaro Corporation is or has been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code.

(h) No Oclaro Corporation has been a member of an affiliated group
of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code or within the

subject, other than the affiliated group of which Parent is the common parent.

 

(i) Parent has delivered or Made Available to the Company accurate and
complete copies of all federal and state income Tax Returns of the Oclaro
Corporations for all Tax years that remain open or are otherwise subject to
audit (other than years that remain open solely because of the carry forward
of net operating losses or other Tax attributes), and all other material Tax
Returns of the Oclaro Corporations filed since December 31, 2007.

(j) No Oclaro Corporation has participated in, or is currently participating
in, a "Listed Transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2) or similar transaction under any corresponding or similar Legal
Requirement.

 

(k) Parent is not aware of any agreement, plan, fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

3.16 Employee and Labor Matters; Benefit Plans.

(a) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or
as required by applicable Legal Requirements, the employment of each of the
Oclaro Corporations employees is terminable by the applicable Oclaro
Corporation at will.

(b) None of the Oclaro Corporations is a party to, or has a duty to bargain
for, any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor
organization or works council representing any of its employees and there are
no labor organizations or works councils representing, purporting to represent
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, seeking to represent any employees of any of
the Oclaro Corporations. Since January 1, 2010, there has not been any
strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor
dispute, question concerning representation, union organizing activity, or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, any threat thereof, affecting any of the Oclaro
Corporations or any of their employees. There is not now pending, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no Person has threatened to commence, any such strike,
slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor dispute,
question regarding representation or union organizing activity or any similar
activity or dispute. There is no claim or grievance pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened relating to any employment Contract, wages and
hours, leave of absence, plant closing notification, employment statute or
regulation, work rule (together with all policies and supplements related
thereto), privacy right, labor dispute, safety, retaliation, immigration or
discrimination matters involving any Parent Associate, including charges
of unfair labor practices or harassment complaints.

 



42 (c) Parent has delivered or Made Available to the Company an accurate and
complete list, by country and as of the date hereof, of: (i) each Parent
Employee Plan; (ii) each Parent Employee Agreement; and (iii) all work rules
(together with all policies and supplements related thereto) and employee
manuals and handbooks relating to employees of any Oclaro Corporation. None
of the Oclaro Corporations intends, and none of the Oclaro Corporations has
committed, to establish or enter into any new Parent Employee Plan or Parent
Employee Agreement, or to modify any Parent Employee Plan or Parent Employee
Agreement (except to conform any such Parent Employee Plan or Parent Employee
Agreement to the requirements of any applicable Legal Requirements or as
required by this Agreement).

 

(d) Parent has delivered or Made Available to the Company accurate and
complete copies of: (i) all documents setting forth the terms of each Parent
Employee Plan and each Parent Employee Agreement, including all amendments
thereto and all related trust documents; (ii) the three most recent annual
reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached
thereto), if any, required under applicable Legal Requirements in connection
with each Parent Employee Plan; (iii) if the Parent Employee Plan is subject
to the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA, the most
recent annual and periodic accounting of Parent Employee Plan assets, if any;
(iv) the most recent summary plan description together with the summaries of
material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA or any similar
Legal Requirement with respect to each Parent Employee Plan; (v) all material
written Contracts relating to each Parent Employee Plan, including
administrative service agreements and group insurance contracts; (vi) all
discrimination tests required under the Code for each Parent Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the three most
recent plan years; and (vii) the most recent IRS determination or opinion
letter issued with respect to each Parent Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(e) Each of the Oclaro Corporations and Parent Affiliates has performed in
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
each Parent Employee Plan, and each Parent Employee Plan has been established
and maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms. Any
Parent Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if
applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code. All Parent Pension
Plans required to have been approved by any Governmental Body have been so
approved, no such approval has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred to the Knowledge of
Parent since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor
relating to any such Parent Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to
materially affect any such approval relating thereto or materially increase
the costs relating thereto. Each Parent Employee Plan intended to be tax
qualified under applicable Legal Requirements is so tax qualified, and no
event has occurred and no circumstance or condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any such Parent
Employee Plan. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975
of the Code or Sections 406 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under a
statutory or administrative exemption, has occurred with respect to
any Parent Employee Plan. There are no audits or inquiries pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened by the IRS, the DOL or any other Governmental
Body with respect to any Parent Employee Plan. None of the Oclaro
Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any material
penalty or Tax with respect to any Parent Employee Plan under Section 502(i)
of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any material
penalty or Tax under applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any Parent
Employee Plan. Each of the Oclaro Corporations and Parent Affiliates has made
all contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of
each Parent Employee Plan. No Parent Employee Agreement or Parent Employee
Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code could
reasonably be expected to result in gross income inclusion pursuant to
Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

 



43 (f) None of the Oclaro Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any:
(i) Parent Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; (ii) "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described
in Section 413 of the Code. No Parent Employee Plan is or has been funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association"
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. None of the Oclaro
Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, has ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in or contributed to any Parent Pension Plan in which
stock of any of the Oclaro Corporations or any Parent Affiliate is or was held
as a plan asset. The fair market value of the assets of each funded Parent
Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Parent Foreign Plan funded
through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Parent Foreign
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all
current and former participants in such Parent Foreign Plan according to the
reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Parent Foreign
Plan, and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. There are
no liabilities of the Oclaro Corporations with respect to any Parent Employee
Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements
of Parent in accordance with GAAP.

 

(g) None of the Oclaro Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, maintains,
sponsors or contributes to any Parent Employee Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and
that is, in whole or in part, self-funded or self-insured. No Parent Employee
Plan provides (except at no cost to the Oclaro Corporations or any
Parent Affiliate), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the
Oclaro Corporations or any Parent Affiliate to provide, post-termination or
retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other
post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any
of the Oclaro Corporations or any Parent Affiliate, none of the Oclaro
Corporations nor any Parent Affiliate has ever represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Parent Associate (either
individually or to Parent Associates as a group) or any other Person that
such Parent Associate(s) or other Person would be provided with post-
termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health
benefit or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits, except
to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

(h) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions will or could reasonably be expected to (either
alone or upon the occurrence of termination of employment) constitute an event
under any Parent Employee Plan, Parent Employee Agreement, trust or loan that
will or may result (either alone or in connection with any other circumstance
or event) in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Parent Associate.

(i) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
each of the Oclaro Corporations and Parent Affiliates: (i) is, and at all
times has been, in compliance in all material respects with any Order or
arbitration award of any court, arbitrator or any Governmental Body respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,
hours or other labor related matters; (ii) has withheld and reported all
amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to be
withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to
Parent Associates; (iii) is not liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes
with respect thereto or any interest or penalty for failure to comply with the
Legal Requirements applicable of the foregoing; and (iv) is not liable for
any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on
behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security, social charges or other benefits or obligations
for Parent Associates (other than routine payments to be made in the normal
course of business and consistent with past practice).

 



44 (j) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
Parent Associate, and no payments have been made or will be made to any
Parent Associate, that, in connection with the Merger, considered individually
or considered collectively with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or
could reasonably be expected to, be characterized as a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to Section 162(m) of the Code (or any comparable provision under state or
foreign Tax laws). No Oclaro Corporation is a party to or has any obligation
under any Contract to compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant
to Section 4999 of the Code or for additional taxes payable pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code.

(k) Since July 1, 2010, none of the Oclaro Corporations has effectuated a
"plant closing," partial "plant closing," "relocation", "mass layoff" or
"termination" (as defined in the WARN Act or any similar Legal Requirement)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of any of the Oclaro Corporations.

3.17 Environmental Matters.

(a) Since January 1, 2007, none of the Oclaro Corporations has received any
written notice (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other communication,
whether written or otherwise), whether from a Governmental Body, citizens
group, or other Person, that alleges that any of the Oclaro Corporations is
not or might not be in compliance in any material respect with any
Environmental Law, which non-compliance has not been cured or for which there
is any remaining material liability.

 

(b) To the Knowledge of Parent: (i) all Oclaro Leased Real Property and any
other property that is or was leased to or controlled or used by any of the
Oclaro Corporations, and all surface water, groundwater and soil associated
with or adjacent to such property, is free of any Materials of Environmental
Concern or material environmental contamination except as would not
reasonably be expected to require any corrective action or other remedial
obligations under Environmental Laws by the Oclaro Corporations; (ii) none of
the Oclaro Leased Real Property or any other property that is or was leased to
or controlled or used by any of the Oclaro Corporations contains any
underground storage tanks, asbestos, equipment using PCBs or underground

other property that is or was leased to or controlled or used by any of the
Oclaro Corporations contains any septic tanks in which process wastewater or

transported, or arranged to send or transport, any Materials of Environmental
Concern to a site that, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law: (i) has
been placed on the United States Environmental Protection Agencys "National
Priorities List" or any similar state list of hazardous waste sites; (ii) is
otherwise designated or identified as a potential site for remediation,
cleanup, closure or other environmental remedial activity; or (iii) is subject
to a Legal Requirement to take "removal" or "remedial" action as detailed in
any applicable Environmental Law or to make payment for the cost of cleaning
up any site.

(d) None of the Oclaro Corporations has entered into any Parent Contract that
may require any of them to guarantee, reimburse, defend, hold harmless or
indemnify any other party with respect to liabilities arising out of
Environmental Laws, or the activities of the Oclaro Corporations or any other
Person relating to Materials of Environmental Concern.

 



45 3.18 Insurance. Each material insurance policy and self-insurance program
and arrangement relating to the business, assets and operations of the Oclaro
Corporations is in full force and effect. Since January 1, 2010, none of the
Oclaro Corporations has received any written notice (or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other communication, whether written or otherwise) regarding any
actual or possible: (a) cancellation or invalidation of any material insurance
policy; (b) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material claim under
any material insurance policy; or (c) material adjustment in the amount of
the premiums payable with respect to any material insurance policy. There is
no pending workers compensation or other claim under or based upon any
material insurance policy of any of the Oclaro Corporations involving an
amount in excess of $100,000 in any individual case or $500,000 in the
aggregate.

 

3.19 Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, during the period
commencing on the date of Parents last proxy statement filed with the SEC
through the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that would be
required to be reported by Parent pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC.

3.20 Legal Proceedings; Orders.

 

(a) There is no pending Legal Proceeding, and (to the Knowledge of Parent) no
Person has threatened to commence any material Legal Proceeding: (i) that
involves any of the Oclaro Corporations, or any business of the Oclaro

Corporations; or (ii) that challenges, or that may have the effect
of preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with, the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

 

(b) There is no Order to which any of the Oclaro Corporations, or any of the
assets owned or used by any of the Oclaro Corporations, is subject. To the
Knowledge of Parent, no officer or other key employee of any of the Oclaro
Corporations is subject to any Order that prohibits such officer or other
employee from engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or practice
relating to the business of any of the Oclaro Corporations.

3.21 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have the
corporate right, power and authority to enter into and, subject to obtaining
the Required Parent Stockholder Vote (as defined in Section 3.22), the
Required Amendment Vote (as defined in Section 3.22) and the Required Merger
Sub Stockholder Vote (as defined in Section 3.22), to perform their respective

Section 8, the Company: (i) shall take all action necessary under all
applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this
Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"); and (ii) shall submit such
proposal to such holders at the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not
submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Companys
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The
Company in consultation with Parent shall set a record date for Persons
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Companys Stockholders Meeting and
shall not change such record date without the prior written consent
of Parent. The Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held (on a date
selected by the Company in consultation with Parent) as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company after consultation with
Parent may adjourn or postpone the Companys Stockholders Meeting: (A) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that is required by applicable Legal Requirements is
timely provided to the Companys stockholders; (B) if as of the time for which
the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be
conducted at the Companys Stockholders Meeting; or (C) if additional time is
reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement.

(b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include a statement to the effect that the Company Board recommends that the
Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement being referred to as the
"Company Board Recommendation"); (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall
not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent; (iii) neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A) fail to reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation, or fail to publicly state that the Merger and
this Agreement are in the best interest of the Companys stockholders, within
ten business days after Parent requests in writing that such action be taken;
(B) fail to publicly announce, within ten business days after a tender offer
or exchange offer relating to the securities of the Company shall have been
commenced, a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection
of such tender or exchange offer; or (C) resolve to take any action described
in clauses "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions
described in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to as a "Company
Change in Recommendation").

 



59 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b)
or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may
effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may be, a Company Change
in Recommendation or, alternatively, solely with respect to clause "(i)" of
this Section 5.2(c), may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 8.1(j) and pay Parent the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 8.3(b):

(i) if: (A) the Company has not materially breached its obligations
under Section 4.4(a) in connection with the Acquisition Proposal referred to
in the following clause "(B);" (B) after the date of this Agreement, an
unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company
and is not withdrawn; (C) the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with an independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a Company Superior Offer; (D) the
Company Board does not effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Company
Change in Recommendation and does not terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8.1(j), in either case at any time within five
business days after Parent receives written notice from the Company
confirming that the Company Board has determined that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Company Superior Offer; (E) during such five business day
period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the offer that was determined to constitute a Company Superior Offer no longer
constitutes a Company Superior Offer; (F) at the end of such five business day
period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to
constitute a Company Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Company Superior Offer, the failure to make a Company Change in
Recommendation or, alternatively, terminate this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of Section 8.1(j), would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; or

 

(ii) if: (A) other than the development or circumstances contemplated by
clause "(i)" of this Section 5.2(c), a material development or change in
circumstances that affects the business, assets or operations of any Opnext
Corporation occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was neither
known to any Opnext Corporation nor reasonably foreseeable to any Opnext
Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (such material development or
change in circumstances being referred to as a "Company Intervening Event");
(B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with
its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event,
the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; (C) at least five business days prior to
effecting a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company provides Parent with
a written notice specifying the facts underlying the Company Boards
determination that a Company Intervening Event has occurred and the rationale
and basis for such Company Change in Recommendation; (D) during such five-
business day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for the Company Board to effect, or cause the Company to
effect, a Company Change in Recommendation as a result of such Company
Intervening Event; and (E) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
having consulted with its outside legal counsel and after the conclusion of
such five business day period, that, in light of such Company Intervening
Event, the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(D)" or otherwise).

(d) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be submitted
to the holders of Companys Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting
for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation.

 



60 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company
from: (i) taking, and disclosing to its stockholders, a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or a statement required under Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to stockholders of
the Company that is required by applicable Legal Requirements; provided,
_however_ , that any disclosure other than: (A) a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; (B) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal; or (C) an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation,
shall, in each case, be deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation.

Meeting and, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement (and except
for Parent Proposals), shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in
connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior written

Stockholders Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior
written consent of the Company. The Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be held
on the date that (or, to the extent that Parent and the Company agree, as
promptly as practicable after) this Agreement shall have been adopted by the
Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Parent shall
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent Stockholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent

61 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(b)
or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of the

Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a
Parent Superior Offer no longer constitutes a Parent Superior Offer; (F) at
the end of such five business day period, such Acquisition Proposal has not

circumstances that affects the business, assets or operations of any Oclaro

change in circumstances being referred to as an "Parent Intervening Event");
(B) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with
its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Parent Intervening Event,
the failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the

rationale and basis for such Parent Change in Recommendation; (D) during such
five-business day period, if requested by the Company, Parent engages in good
faith negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for the Parent Board to effect, or cause Parent to
effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation as a result of such Parent
Intervening Event; and (E) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
having consulted with its outside legal counsel and after the conclusion of
such five business day period, that, in light of such Parent Intervening
Event, the failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would be a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board to Parents stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(D)" or otherwise).

 



62 (d) Notwithstanding any Parent Change in Recommendation, unless earlier

taking, and disclosing to its stockholders, a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under

communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act; (B) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal; or (C)
an express reaffirmation of the Parent Board Recommendation, shall, in each
case, be deemed to be a Parent Change in Recommendation.

5.4 Company Options; Company RSUs; and Company SARs.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock,
and Parent shall assume such Company Option in accordance with the terms (as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) of the Company Equity Plan
and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is
evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company
Options assumed by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time: (A) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for
shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Option assumed by Parent
shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) except as provided in the
foregoing clauses "(A)," "(B)" and "(C)," any restriction on the exercise of
any Company Option assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect
and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule, terms of acceleration and all
other provisions of such Company Option shall remain subject to the same terms
and conditions set forth in the Company Equity Plan and the applicable stock
option agreement, employment agreement or other agreement evidencing such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_
that Parent Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to
each Company Option assumed by Parent.

 



63 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU with respect to
which shares of Company Common Stock remain unvested or unissued as of the
Effective Time shall be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit
reflecting Parent Common Stock and shall remain subject to the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Company Equity Plan and the applicable restricted
stock unit agreement, employment agreement or other agreement evidencing such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
conditions and terms of acceleration, except that the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such converted Company RSU shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU by the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.4(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, each Company RSU that is vested as of the
Effective Time and, pursuant to the terms of the applicable restricted stock
unit agreement evidencing such Company RSU, would otherwise be paid to the
holder in shares of Company Common Stock upon or by reference to a Change in
Control (as defined in such restricted stock unit agreement), shall be paid
or deemed paid in shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive
the consideration set forth in Section 1.5(a)(iii) with respect to each such
share of Company Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth therein.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company SAR that is outstanding
and that remains unsettled as of the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into a stock appreciation right with respect to Parent Common
Stock and shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in
the Company Equity Plan and the applicable stock appreciation right agreement,
employment agreement or other agreement evidencing such Company SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting conditions,
form of payment and terms of acceleration, except that: (i) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such converted Company SAR (and,
if applicable, payable upon settlement thereof) shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to (and, if
applicable, payable upon settlement of) such Company SAR by the Exchange Ratio
and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) the per share exercise price for each Company
SAR assumed by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise
price of such Company SAR, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to
the nearest whole cent.

(d) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 15 days after the date on
which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form S-8, if
available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to the Company Options assumed by Parent in accordance
with Section 5.4(a), the Company RSUs converted in accordance with Section
5.4(b) and the Company SARs converted accordance with Section 5.4(c).

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent may (if Parent determines that it desires to
do so) assume the Company Equity Plan. If Parent elects to assume the Company
Equity Plan, then, under the Company Equity Plan, Parent shall be entitled to
grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal
Requirements, using the share reserves of the Company Equity Plan as of the
Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a
result of the termination of Company Options that are assumed by Parent
pursuant to Section 5.4(a)), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards
shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in the Company
Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common
Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the Parent
Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to
the administration of the Company Equity Plan.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action as it
determines to be necessary (under the Company Equity Plan and otherwise) to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.4.

 



64 5.5 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof)
to, provide each Continuing Employee total compensation and employee benefits
(other than with respect to equity-based compensation) that are at least
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the total compensation
and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide that,
subject to any applicable plan provisions or contractual requirements as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or Legal Requirements: (i) all Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in each "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and each vacation and severance plan (that is
not an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof) to the
same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; and (ii) for purposes
of determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such
plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual), such Continuing Employee
shall receive credit under such plans for his or her years of continuous
service with the Opnext Corporations prior to the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA and each vacation and severance plan (that is not an "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof) (collectively, the " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee will participate after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and level of benefits, but not for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan, in any such Parent Benefit Plan to the same
extent as such service was taken into account under a corresponding Company
Employee Plan as of the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements (provided that such preexisting
condition limitations, exclusions or waiting periods can legally be waived by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation without the consent of any insurance
carrier) applicable to the Continuing Employees and their spouses, domestic
partners and eligible dependents under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a
welfare benefit plan in which such Continuing Employees and their spouses,
domestic partners and eligible dependents may be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, other than preexisting condition limitations, exclusions
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees and their spouses, domestic partners and eligible dependents and
that have not been satisfied or waived as of the Effective Time under any
welfare benefit plan maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and (ii) provide Continuing Employees and their
spouses, domestic partners and eligible dependents with credit for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs for any co-payments, annual out-of-
pocket limits and deductibles for expenses incurred prior to the Effective
Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan in which such Continuing
Employees and their spouses, domestic partners and eligible dependents may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time (provided that such credits
can legally be provided by Parent or the Surviving Corporation without the
consent of any insurance carrier).

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create: (i) a right in any Company Associate to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent; or (ii)
with any Company Associate any third-party rights, benefits or remedies of
any nature whatsoever. Except for Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section
5.6) to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.6, no
Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a
third party beneficiary of this Agreement. No provision of this Section 5.5
shall modify or amend any other agreement, plan, program or document unless
this Agreement expressly states that the provision "amends" that other
agreement, plan, program or document.

 



65 (e) If requested by Parent in writing at least ten days prior to the Closing,
the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on
which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any
Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the
Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of
resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review
of Parent).

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall ensure that
its Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the Opnext
Corporations do not, make any communications with any employees of the Opnext
Corporations regarding post-Closing employment matters, including post-Closing
employee benefits and compensation, which are inconsistent with the terms
of this Agreement, without the prior approval of Parent, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to indemnify their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of any of the Opnext Corporations prior to the Effective Time
(the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent that applicable Legal
Requirements permit a company to indemnify its own directors and officers and
in compliance with any agreements related to such indemnification that are in
effect as of the date hereof, including any provision therein relating to
advancement of expenses.

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the existing
policy of Companys directors and officers liability insurance (or a
comparable replacement policy) (the "DandO Policy") covering claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time to the
extent that such claims are of the type covered by the DandO Policy (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to the extent that such acts or
omissions are covered by the DandO Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party
who is covered as of the Effective Time by the DandO Policy, in any case on
terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those terms in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth on Part 5.6(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (such 200% amount,
the "Maximum Annual Premium"); and _provided further_ , _however_ , that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest comparable coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under the first sentence of this
Section 5.6(b), Parent may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable in
the aggregate than the DandO Policy, and in the event that Parent shall purchase
such a "tail" policy, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 5.6(b)
for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

 



66 (c) The obligations under this Section 5.6 shall not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the
"tail" policy referred to in Section 5.6(b)) (and any of such persons heirs
and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or
the "tail" policy referred to in Section 5.6(b) (and, after the death of any
of the foregoing persons, such persons heirs and representatives). Each of
the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 5.6(b) (and, after the
death of any of the foregoing persons, such persons heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.6, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of
the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the

of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by Parents stockholders, no amendment

instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



77 9.2 Waiver.

Time, any party hereto may: (i) extend the time for the performance of any of

in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and

understood that no provision in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall limit any partys rights or remedies in the case of fraud).
This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall

bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



78 9.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action
between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the Contemplated Transactions: (a) each of the parties irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware; and (b) each of the parties
irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy). All rights and remedies
existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any
rights or remedies otherwise available. The parties hereto further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Legal Requirements or inequitable for any reason, and agree not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

 

9.6 Disclosure Schedules. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained
in Section 2\. The Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in separate
parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in Section
3\. The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule shall each
be delivered as of the date hereof, and no amendments or modifications thereto
shall be made. Any purported update or modification to the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule after the date hereof shall
be disregarded.

9.7 Attorneys Fees. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this
Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party
in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit.

 

9.8 Assignability; No Third Party Rights. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; _provided,
however,_ that neither this Agreement nor any partys rights or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment or
delegation of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties shall be void and of no
effect. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto) any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except (i) as specifically provided in Section 5.6 and (ii) after
the Effective Time, with respect to the payment of consideration to holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1 hereof.
