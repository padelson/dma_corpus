<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June&nbsp;30, 2010 (this &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;), by and among
THE BOEING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), VORTEX MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<B>Merger Sub</B>&#148;), and ARGON ST, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<B>Company Common Stock</B>&#148;) on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes
to cause Merger Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted
under this Agreement, the &#147;<B>Offer</B>&#148;) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock for consideration of a price per share of Company Common Stock of $34.50 (such amount, or any
other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the &#147;<B>Offer Price</B>&#148;), net to
the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to
certain limitations set forth herein, each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i)&nbsp;determined that the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;approved, adopted and declared advisable
this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii)&nbsp;resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and this Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has unanimously (i)
determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
hereby are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and Merger Sub and (ii)&nbsp;approved, adopted
and declared advisable this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s willingness to enter
into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders of
the Company are entering into tender and voting agreements with Parent and Merger Sub (the &#147;<B>Tender
Agreements</B>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken all actions necessary to render
Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<B>DGCL</B>&#148;) inapplicable to Merger Sub, this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Tender Agreements and the other transactions contemplated
hereby; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Offer and the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,

later than five Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the &#147;<B>Exchange Act</B>&#148;), the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to,
and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in
Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;<B>Offer Conditions</B>&#148;). The Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time,
on the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such time, the &#147;<B>Initial Expiration Date</B>,&#148; and such
time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the &#147;<B>Expiration Date</B>&#148;). Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify
the terms of the Offer; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i)&nbsp;reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;reduce the Offer Price, (iii)&nbsp;change, modify or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv)&nbsp;add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A or
modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in any material respect to any
holders of Company Common Stock, (v)&nbsp;except as otherwise provided in this Section&nbsp;1.1(a),
extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer, (vi)&nbsp;change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer or (vii)&nbsp;otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the
terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company
Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub may,
in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, (A)&nbsp;without limiting Parent&#146;s or
Merger Sub&#146;s obligations under the following sentence, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five Business Days (or such longer period as
the parties hereto may agree) each, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer
any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by
Parent or Merger Sub, waived, (B)&nbsp;extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<B>SEC</B>&#148;)
or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (C)&nbsp;extend the
Offer so that the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer, when
combined with the Top-Up Shares to be issued to Merger Sub upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, would result in Merger Sub owning one more share than 90% of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding. Parent and Merger Sub agree that, to the extent requested in
writing by the Company prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (A)&nbsp;if any of the Offer Conditions set forth in
clause (ii)&nbsp;of Exhibit&nbsp;A or in paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of clause (iii)&nbsp;of Exhibit&nbsp;A shall not
have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived, and provided
that it is reasonably expected that such condition or conditions shall be satisfied prior to
the Termination Date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments
of up to five Business Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree),
until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied (but not beyond the Termination Date)
and (B)&nbsp;if any of the Minimum Tender Condition or the Offer Conditions set forth in
paragraph (d)&nbsp;or (e)&nbsp;of clause (iii)&nbsp;of Exhibit&nbsp;A shall not have been satisfied or, to the
extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived on such then-scheduled Expiration Date, but
all the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A shall be satisfied on such
then-scheduled Expiration Date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive
increments of up to five Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may
agree) each, for an aggregate period of time of not more than 20 Business Days;
<U>provided</U>, however, that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond
the Termination Date; and <U>provided</U> <U>further</U>, that Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer for more than three Business Days after the Company delivers or
is required to deliver to Parent a notice with respect to a Takeover Proposal that has been
received by the Company, any of its controlled Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.2, except to the extent that prior to the
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended by such three Business Day period), the
Takeover Proposal giving rise to such notice has been withdrawn or the Board of Directors of
the Company has rejected the Takeover Proposal giving rise to such notice and, in each case,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">Company Recommendation and the withdrawal or rejection of such Takeover Proposal, and
the reconfirmation of the Company Recommendation has been publicly announced by the Company.
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to any withholding
of Tax pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.1(d)) all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date of the Offer.
Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;<B>Offer Closing</B>,&#148; and the
date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;<B>Offer
Closing Date</B>.&#148; Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to extend
the Offer for a &#147;subsequent offering period&#148; in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the
Exchange Act following the Offer Closing, and the Offer Documents may, in Merger Sub&#146;s sole
discretion, provide for such a reservation of right. The Offer may not be terminated prior
to its Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Article&nbsp;VIII or Exhibit&nbsp;A. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;8.1, prior to the acceptance for payment
of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall
cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Company Common
Stock to the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;1.1(a) shall
affect any termination rights in Article&nbsp;VIII, as to the Agreement, or in Exhibit&nbsp;A, as to
the Offer.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule&nbsp;TO filed under cover of Schedule&nbsp;TO with respect to
the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement (such Schedule&nbsp;TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which
the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the &#147;<B>Offer
Documents</B>&#148;). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information
concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the
Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to give the
Company the opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the
staff of the SEC related thereto. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders
of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version
thereof), and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such
comments.

obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such
amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), or any other
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Merger Sub to
the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub.

Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the
