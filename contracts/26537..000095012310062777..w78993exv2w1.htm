AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 30, 2010 (this "Agreement"), by and among THE BOEING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), VORTEX MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and ARGON ST, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes to cause Merger Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for consideration of a price per share of Company Common Stock of $34.50 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to certain limitations set forth herein, each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and Merger Sub and (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into tender and voting agreements with Parent and Merger Sub (the "Tender Agreements"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken all actions necessary to render Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") inapplicable to Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Tender Agreements and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and 

  

 WHEREAS Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 
  _THE OFFER_  

    

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions"). The Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such time, the "Initial Expiration Date," and such time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.1(a), extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, (A) without limiting Parents or Merger Subs obligations under the following sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived, (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (C) extend the Offer so that the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer, when combined with the Top-Up Shares to be issued to Merger Sub upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, would result in Merger Sub owning one more share than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding. Parent and Merger Sub agree that, to the extent requested in writing by the Company prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (A) if any of the Offer Conditions set forth in clause (ii) of Exhibit A or in paragraph (a) or (b) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived, and provided that it is reasonably expected that such condition or conditions shall be satisfied prior to the Termination Date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five Business Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree), until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied (but not beyond the Termination Date) and (B) if any of the Minimum Tender Condition or the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (d) or (e) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived on such then-scheduled Expiration Date, but all the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A shall be satisfied on such then-scheduled Expiration Date, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each, for an aggregate period of time of not more than 20 Business Days;  _provided_ , however, that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date; and _provided_ _further_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer for more than three Business Days after the Company delivers or is required to deliver to Parent a notice with respect to a Takeover Proposal that has been received by the Company, any of its controlled Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives in accordance with Section 5.2, except to the extent that prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended by such three Business Day period), the Takeover Proposal giving rise to such notice has been withdrawn or the Board of Directors of the Company has rejected the Takeover Proposal giving rise to such notice and, in each case, the Board of Directors of the Company has reconfirmed the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Recommendation and the withdrawal or rejection of such Takeover
Proposal, and the reconfirmation of the Company Recommendation has been
publicly announced by the Company. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant
to Section 1.1(d)) all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the
Expiration Date of the Offer. Acceptance for payment of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing," and the date on which
the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Closing Date." Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to extend the Offer for a "subsequent offering period" in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act following the Offer
Closing, and the Offer Documents may, in Merger Subs sole discretion,
provide for such a reservation of right. The Offer may not be terminated
prior to its Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Article VIII or Exhibit A. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, prior to the acceptance for payment of Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Company
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in this
Section 1.1(a) shall affect any termination rights in Article VIII, as to the
Agreement, or in Exhibit A, as to the Offer. 

   

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed under cover of Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to give the Company the opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. 

   

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (d) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Merger Sub to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub. 

   ##### 

  

   

 Section 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing the Company Recommendation and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all necessary consents of Stone Key Partners LLC to permit the Company to include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, a copy of the opinion of Stone Key Partners LLC described in Section 4.1(t). Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to give Parent the opportunity to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation contained in the Schedule 14D-9. 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement dated March 5, 2010 between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall dispose of all copies of such information then in their possession or control in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 Section 1.3 _Top-Up Option_. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.3, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares on a "fully diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of
all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the
vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number
of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common
Stock authorized (whether unissued or held in the treasury of the Company)
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (giving effect to the shares of
Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding stock options,
restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock
as if such shares were outstanding) and (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up
Option and the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not be
prohibited by any Law or Judgment. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable
at any one time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur
of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Company to issue and deliver
the Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject only to
the condition that no Legal Restraint (other than any listing requirement of
any national securities exchange) that has the effect of preventing the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up
Shares in respect of such exercise shall be in effect. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the failure to obtain approval of the Companys stockholders of the issuance
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up Option as a result of
applicable stock exchange listing requirements shall not cause any
condition of the Offer not to be met. Upon Parents written request, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to
certify in writing to Parent the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, and for so long as this Agreement has not
been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, the Company agrees that it
shall maintain out of its existing authorized capital, free from preemptive
rights, sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Agreement so that the Top-Up Option may be
exercised, after giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock issuable
pursuant to all other then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock units
and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares were
outstanding. 

   

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"). In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company by issuance by Merger Sub to the Company of a non-negotiable and non-transferable promissory note, secured by the Top-Up Shares and bearing compounding interest at 5% per annum, with principal and interest due one year after the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, prepayable in whole or in part without premium or penalty. 

   

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

ARTICLE III 
  _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS;_ 
  _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

    

 Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or the holder of any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 3.1(d), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and any shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2 and in compliance therewith. At the Effective Time, such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares held in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Adjustment Events_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into, or exchanged for, a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, split, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) payable per share of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted to fairly reflect the effects of such transaction. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and turned over to Parent in accordance with Section 3.2(g). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed (or, if such shares of Company Common Stock are held in uncertificated, book-entry form, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (it being understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock, provided that the holders of any book-entry shares shall not be required to surrender any Certificates in connection with the procedures set forth in this Article III)), and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate that is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to the date which is nine months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the 

   ##### 

  

   

making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the date which is six months after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, subject to the time limitations in Section 3.2(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. 

   

 Section 3.3 _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" means any shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Dissenting Stockholder thereof has properly exercised appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to seek appraisal of its Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder and not any Merger Consideration. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed properly to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement if conditions to payment are met. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands 

  

ARTICLE IV

 Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed on or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC Documents") (other than any forward-looking disclosures contained in "Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Filed Company SEC Documents and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) and only to the extent reasonably apparent from the disclosure therein or in the disclosure schedule to this Agreement delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

   ##### 

  

   

Offer, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, (iii) declaring that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are
fair to the Company and the Companys stockholders (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) and (iv) recommending that the Companys stockholders
accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and, if required by applicable Law, adopt this Agreement (collectively,
the "Company Recommendation"), which resolutions, except to the extent

 Section 5.2 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or its controlled Affiliates directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or offers or the making of any proposal or any other efforts or attempt that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any communications or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with any Person with respect to, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or offers or the making of any proposal or any other efforts or attempt that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing communications and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal received after the date hereof that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) (x) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) that failure to so respond to such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2, may, and may permit and authorize its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates Representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with Section 5.2(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with standstill provisions identical in all substantive respects to, and which otherwise contains terms that are no less favorable to the Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal; provided, that the Company shall concurrently provide or make available to Parent any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such third party which was not previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2(a) by any controlled Affiliate of the Company or any of the Companys or its controlled Affiliates Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company of this Section 5.2(a). 

   

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal" means any
proposal, inquiry or offer (whether or not in writing) from any Person (other
than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) with respect to, in a
single transaction or series of transactions, any (i) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving
the Company, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly
or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock
of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise), of
any business or asset or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
representing 15% or more of the consolidated net income, revenues or assets
(whether determined by reference to book value or fair market value) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders
of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) or any interest in such securities representing 15% or more of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of the voting power of
the Companys capital stock, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the
stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, Beneficial
Ownership, or the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership, or formation of any
group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire Beneficial
Ownership of, 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or of the voting power of the Companys capital stock or (v) combination of
the foregoing.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any binding
_bona fide_ written offer, which was not solicited after the date hereof and
did not result from a breach of Section 5.2(a), made by any Person (other
than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) that, if consummated,
would result in such Person (or in the case of a direct merger between such
Person and the Company, the stockholders of such Person) acquiring, directly
or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or of the voting power of the Companys capital stock or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and which offer the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (i) provides a
higher value from a financial point of view to all of the stockholders of
the Company than the consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger
(taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer or this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed in a timely
fashion, taking into account the conditionality and likelihood of
consummation and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal. 

   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation or any approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action, (ii) fail to publicly recommend against any Takeover Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation or any approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger within two (2) Business Days after Parent so requests, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.2(a)), or (v) take any other action or make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any such action or resolution or agreement to take such action in clauses (i)  (v) above being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal, and after determining in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement, _provided_ , concurrently with any such termination, the Company pays to Parent the fee required by Section 6.6(b)(ii)(B) and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent the fee required by Section 6.6(b)(ii)(B); _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) may be made, in each case unless the Company has complied with all its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.2. No Adverse Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) may be made unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (I) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (an "Adverse Recommendation Change Notice") or (II) terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) in response to a Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which notice shall contain a description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, together with any information required to be delivered to Parent concurrently therewith pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and (B) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after the receipt of such notice (the "Notice Period"), a proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor), cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. If Parent has in good faith 

   ##### 

  

 

proposed to the Company revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement during the Notice Period prior to the Company
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), the Company agrees that the Company and its
Representatives shall, during the Notice Period and if requested by Parent in
writing, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (so long
as Parent and its Representatives are negotiating in good faith) regarding
any such revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent. Any material changes to the financial terms or
any material change to other material terms of such Superior Proposal
occurring prior to the Companys effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) shall require
the Company to provide to Parent a new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice
or Superior Proposal Notice and a new Notice Period and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.2(b) with respect to each such new written
notice. In determining whether to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
whether to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any such changes to
Parents proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor), cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.2, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including the identity of the bidder and any change to the financial terms, conditions or other material terms thereof). The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any change to the financial terms, conditions, or other material terms) of any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry on a reasonably current basis (and in any event at Parents request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material change, development, discussions or negotiations) and (ii) provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written material to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any Takeover Proposal or, where no such written materials are available, a reasonably detailed description of such Takeover Proposal), written inquiries or correspondence sent by or provided to the Company (or its Representatives) in connection with any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any Contract, in each case that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure so to disclose is reasonably likely to result in a breach of applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the taking of any such position or making of any such disclosure shall be subject to and only taken in compliance with Section 5.2(b) and,  _provided_ _further_ , that any disclosure other than (i) a factually accurate statement by the Company that only describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making such proposal, and the terms and conditions thereof, and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, and contains a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood that any disclosure of the type described in clause (i) above shall be deemed not to be an Adverse Recommendation Change so long as any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication) is accompanied by the disclosure of the types described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above).

ARTICLE VI 
  _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_  

   

 Section 6.1 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_. 

  

 (a) If the approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

  

 (b) If the approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing (or, with respect to calling, giving notice of, convening and holding a meeting of its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable following the expiration of the time period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act or the resolution of any comments from the SEC), establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. The notice of such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to approve this Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to stockholders of the Company that they approve this Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer and any subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the DGCL. 

  

 (c) At the Stockholders Meeting, if any, Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents Representatives access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, 

   ##### 

  

 

Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees,
but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent
any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish
such information to the extent that doing so is restricted under applicable
Law or otherwise would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
(provided that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege). Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and
Parents Representatives reasonable access to the non-U.S. agents,
consultants and representatives engaged by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and the Company shall, upon Parents request, facilitate fulfilling requests
for information and/or interviews with such non-U.S. agents, consultants or
representatives. Following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), following
reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel
and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the
Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request, provided such review is
permitted by applicable Law. No investigation by Parent or any of its
Representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of
its Representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation or warranty of the Company or any covenant or other provision
in this Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment,
Parent will hold, and will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all
information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, each party shall make all other filings necessary or appropriate under any applicable foreign Competition Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit A and Article VII, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other Persons, (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its review of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

 

any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any Governmental Entity
objects to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections. 

   

 (c) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material, individually or in the aggregate, operational developments, the general status of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such consultation shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of: 

   

 (A) any written notice or other written communication from any Person (other than a Governmental Entity) alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (B) its discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non occurrence of any event the occurrence or non occurrence of which, cause any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Exhibit A hereto to be in effect at the scheduled Expiration Date; 

   

 (C) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity received by the Company in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication shall be furnished to Parent together with the Companys notice; 

   

 (D) any filing made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such filing shall be furnished to Parent together with the Companys notice; and 

   

 (E) any suits, actions or proceedings commenced or threatened that relate to the consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company has Knowledge; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

   

 (iii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or (B) the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform any obligation, covenant or agreement to be performed by such party under this Agreement, in each case in any way that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation by Parent of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements of the 

   ##### 

  

   

parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that the Company shall control such defense and that this Section 6.3(c) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense except to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub is named as a defendant in such litigation and in that case solely as to the defense of Parent and Merger Sub. 

  

 (e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as soon as possible after the date hereof, executed retention and non-competition agreements with Parent (the "Retention and Non-Competition Agreements") from those individuals set forth on Section 6.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans and the Purchase Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any consents, waivers or amendments, as required by the terms of any Company Stock Option, Company SAR, Company RSU, Company Restricted Share or the Purchase Plan, or as reasonably requested by Parent) as may be required to effect the following: 

   

 (i) at the Offer Closing, each unexercised Company Stock Option and Company SAR, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Offer Closing, shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company Stock Option and Company SAR becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Offer Price over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or linked to such Company SAR, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or linked to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Offer Closing (whether vested or unvested), which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing (and in any event within two Business Days); 

   

 (ii) at the Offer Closing, each Company RSU and Company Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Offer Closing shall be canceled, with the holder of such Company RSU and Company Restricted Share becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU and Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Offer Closing, which amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing (and in any event within two Business Days); 

   

 (iii) with respect to the Purchase Plan, (A) participation shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement; (B) such participants may not increase the rate of their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (C) no Purchase Period (as defined in the Purchase Plan) shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement; (D) if, with respect to a Purchase Period in effect on the date of this Agreement, the Offer Closing Date occurs prior to the Purchase Date (as defined in the Purchase Plan) for such Purchase Period, upon the Offer Closing Date, each purchase right under the Purchase Plan outstanding immediately prior to the Offer Closing Date shall be used to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the Purchase Plan regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per participant) at the applicable price determined under the terms of the Purchase Plan for the then

outstanding Purchase Period using such date as the final Purchase Date for
such Purchase Period, and any remaining accumulated but unused payroll
deductions shall be distributed to the relevant participants without interest

Purchase Plan shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the Purchase
Date for the Purchase Period in effect on the date of this Agreement and the

Any Person making a payment pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from that payment such amounts as the payor is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by any Person pursuant to this Section 6.4 to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person entitled to payment under this Section 6.4 in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by a Person pursuant to this Section 6.4. 

  

 (c) Simultaneous with the Offer Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall pay the Company an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of consideration to be paid to holders of Company Stock Options, Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company Restricted Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.4 and the Company shall cause such consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to Section 6.4. 

  

 (d) The Company shall take all steps reasonably required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.4 and any other dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally liable to pay and perform in a timely manner such indemnification obligations. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. 

  

 (c) From the Offer Closing through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time (such period, the "Tail Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii) satisfy its obligation under this Section 6.5(c) by causing the Company to obtain, on or prior to the Closing Date, prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy at Parents expense, in each case, the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the 

   ##### 

  

 

insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 6.5(c); _provided_  
_further_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_

The Company shall promptly take all action requested by Parent necessary or desirable to effect any such election or appointment, including (A) increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company (including by amending the Company By-laws if necessary to increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company), (B) filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors of the Company and (C) obtaining the resignation of such number of its current directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Rules 4350(c) and 4350(d)(2)). The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.9(a), including mailing to its stockholders the Information Statement containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, and the Company agrees to make such mailing concurrently with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be included in the Information Statement with respect to such designees and with respect to Parents officers, directors and Affiliates. After the Offer Closing, the Company shall also, upon Parents request, cause the directors elected or designated by Parent to the Board of Directors of the Company to serve on and constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company of (i) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, except for any committee established to take action with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, (ii) the board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any Company Personnel unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which the Board of Directors of the Company determined is an "Independent Director" within the meaning of NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15) and shall be an "Independent Director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 (a) During the period from the Closing Date until December 31, 2011, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Persons who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain in the employment of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") compensation (including base salary and incentive and bonus opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation) and benefits (including paid time off, 401(k), health and severance) that are materially no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of each (A) "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), excluding any defined benefit pension plan, (B) "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), (C) health or medical plan, program, policy or arrangement, excluding any retiree health or medical benefit plan, (D) bonus, incentive or deferred compensation or equity or equity-based compensation plan, program, policy or arrangement, (E) severance, change in control, retention or termination plan, program, policy or arrangement or (F) other material compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement (each, a "Parent Benefit Plan"), including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals (other than defined benefit pension plan accruals), but not in any case where credit would result in duplication of benefits. 

   

 (c) Following the Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement as of the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan transaction date) and (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date) occurs. 

   

 (d) Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement or by the Retention and Non-Competition Agreements, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), and Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Offer and the Merger constitutes a change of control or change in control, as the case may be, for all purposes under such Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements. 

  

 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time following the Closing Date, subject to Parents and the Companys compliance with any applicable severance or change of control arrangements. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from (i) terminating, or modifying the

terms of employment of, any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date
or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent any Company Benefit Plan,
Company Benefit Agreement, Parent Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries may establish or maintain; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent that, and for so long as, a Continuing Employee remains employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries through December 31, 2011, the compensation
and benefits payable to such employee during such period shall be subject to
Section 6.11(a). No covenant or other undertaking in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, policy
or arrangement, and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement will be amended shall
be effective only upon the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with
the amendment procedures of such plan, program, policy or arrangement.

 Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to 

   ##### 

  

 

enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other
parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among
other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.10. 

   

 Section 9.11 _Enforcement_. 

   

 The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 5.2, were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 5.2, in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the party seeking such injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. In the event that any party seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction or other Judgment. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Consents and Approvals_. 

   

 For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other parties by a Person duly authorized by such party to do so. 

  

 Section 9.13 _Severability_. 

   

 If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof.

EXHIBIT A 
 CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER 

    

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, Merger Sub (x) shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any tendered shares of Company Common Stock and, (y) subject to the terms of Section 1.2 and Article VIII of the Agreement, may delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for any shares of Company Common Stock or terminate or amend the Offer, if: 

  

 (i) there shall not be validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, represents at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a "fully diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities convertible or exercisable into shares of Company Common Stock regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof) on the Expiration Date (the "Minimum Tender Condition"), 

  

 (ii) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer or the Merger under any Competition Law shall not have been terminated or shall not have expired, 

  

 (iii) any of the following events shall exist on the Expiration Date or immediately prior to the Offer Closing: 

   

 (a) there shall be any Law or Judgment enacted, enforced, amended, issued, in effect or deemed applicable to the Offer, by any Governmental Entity (other than the application of the waiting period provisions of any Competition Law to the Offer or to the Merger) the effect of which is to directly or indirectly make illegal or otherwise prohibit or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

   

 (b) there shall exist or be instituted or pending any claim, suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (a) above; 

   

 (c) there shall have occurred following the execution of the Agreement any Event which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

   

(d) (1) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
the first sentence of Section 4.1(a) or in Section 4.1(c), 4.1(d)(i), the
last sentence of 4.1(e)(i), 4.1(r) or 4.1(s) that are qualified as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct in all
respects, and any such representations or warranties that are not so
qualified shall not be true and correct in any material respect, in each case
as of the date of the Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent
such representations and warranties relate to an earlier time (in which case
on and as of such earlier time); or 

   

 (2) any representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement (other than those listed in the preceding clause (1)) shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representations and warranties relate to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such earlier time), except in the case of this clause (2) to the extent that the facts or matters as to which such representations and warranties are not so true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications and limitations as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed by it under the Agreement and such failure to perform shall not have been cured to the good faith satisfaction of Parent; 

   

 (f) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company, executed by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company, dated as of the Offer Closing Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) above have not occurred; or 

   

 (g) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or modified (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) in a manner adverse to Merger Sub the Company Recommendation or Parent shall have received an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice, 

  

 (iv) the Company and Parent shall have reached an agreement that the Offer or the Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability such party has under the Agreement) giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Tender Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
