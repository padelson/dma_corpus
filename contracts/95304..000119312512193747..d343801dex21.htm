Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and
time as the Company and ETP may agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

\- 2 -   merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and
containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
PBCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger have been filed in the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or at such other, later date and time as is
agreed between the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL (such date and time is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the PBCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises

debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided
under the PBCL.

Section 1.5  _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. (a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter

successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation

\- 3 -  ARTICLE II.

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1  _Effect on Capital Stock_. (a) Subject in each case to Section
2.1(d) and Section 2.1(e), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of
any securities of the Company or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, " _Company
Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary
Shares) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive the following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "):

(i) _Mixed Election Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive a combination of common units representing
limited partner interests in ETP (" _Common Units_ ") and cash (such election,
a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to
Section 2.2 (each such share, a " _Mixed Consideration Election Share_ ") and
each No Election Share (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) shall be converted into
the right to receive the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Mixed Election Consideration_ ") of (A) $25.00 in cash
without interest (the " _Standard Cash Consideration_ ") and (B) 0.5245 of a
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common Unit (the " _Standard
Common Unit Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) _Cash Election Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive cash (such election, a " _Cash Election_ ")
has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.2 (each such
share, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive $50.00 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Election Consideration_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Cash Election Amount (as defined
below) exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount (as defined below), then,
instead of being converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration, each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the
Cash Election Consideration,  _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which
shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ "),
and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common Units
equal to the product of the Common Unit Election Consideration, _multiplied
by_ a fraction equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 

" _Cash Election Amount_ " means the product of the number of Cash Election
Shares _multiplied by_ the Cash Election Consideration.

" _Available Cash Election Amount_ " means the difference between (1) the
product of the Standard Cash Consideration _multiplied by_ the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_minus_ (2) the 

 



\- 4 -   product of (1) the sum of the number of Mixed Consideration Election Shares
and the number of No Election Shares, _multiplied by_ and (2) the Standard
Cash Consideration. 

(iii) _Common Unit Election Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock with
respect to which an election to receive Common Units (such election, a "
_Common Unit Election_ ") is properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section
2.2 (each such share, a " _Common Unit Election Share_ ") shall be converted
into the right to receive 1.0490 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Common Units (such number of Common Units, the " _Common Unit Election
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then, instead of being
converted into the right to receive the Common Unit Election Consideration,
each Common Unit Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
(A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess
_divided by_ the number of Common Unit Election Shares, and (B) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common Units equal to the product
of the Common Unit Election Consideration  _multiplied by_ a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election
Consideration _minus_ (II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this
paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election
Consideration.

(b) _Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares_.

 

(i) Each Share that is held directly by the Company in treasury and each Share
that is held directly by ETP or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such Shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

(ii) Each Share that is held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
ETP (other than Merger Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (such Shares, the "
_Subsidiary Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into such number of shares of
common stock, of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage
of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and, together with the shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation issued in respect of the Subsidiary Shares as set forth
in Section 2.1(b)(ii), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving 

 



\- 5 -   Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

(d)  _Fractional Units_. No fractional Common Units shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fractional Common Unit will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu
of such fractional Common Unit representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced
by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more
transactions of Common Units equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number
of Common Units to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by ETP pursuant to
Section 2.3(a) over (ii) the aggregate number of whole Common Units to be
issued to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.3(b) (such excess, the "
_Excess Shares_ "). No certificates or scrip representing fractional Common
Units shall be issued in the Merger. The parties acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Common Units was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to ETP
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Common Units. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to
be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional Common Units,
the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of
Shares, without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.2.

(e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares of the
Company or outstanding units of ETP shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock or unit split (including a reverse stock or unit
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or units, or any
stock or unit dividend or stock or unit distribution with a record
date during such period, the Mixed Election Consideration (including the
Standard Cash Consideration and the Standard Common Unit Consideration), the
Cash Election Consideration and the Common Unit Election Consideration and any
other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to
ETP, Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and thereafter,
all references in this Agreement to the Mixed Election Consideration
(including the Standard Cash Consideration and the Standard Common Unit
Consideration), the Cash Election Consideration and the Common Unit Election
Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be references
to the Mixed Election Consideration (including the Standard Cash
Consideration and the Standard Common Unit Consideration), the Cash Election
Consideration and the Common Unit Election Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items as so adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 2.1(e) shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) _No Dissenters Rights_. In accordance with Section 1930 of the PBCL, the
Merger will not entitle any holder of Company Common Stock to any dissenters
rights, as described in Section 1930 of the PBCL.

 



\- 6 -  Section 2.2 _Election Procedures_. (a) An election form and other appropriate
and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as ETP
shall reasonably specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed no less than thirty (30) days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as ETP and the Company
shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth business day
prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial
owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to
specify (i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with
respect to which such holder makes a Mixed Election; (ii) the number of shares
of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes
a Cash Election; and (iii) the number of shares of such holders Company
Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Common Unit Election.
Any Shares with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York
time, on the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other
time and date as ETP and the Company shall agree) (the " _Election Deadline_
") (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) shall be deemed to be "
_No Election Shares_ ," and the holders of such No Election Shares shall be
deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to such No Election Shares.

(c) ETP shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by all persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and
the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. After a Mixed Election, Cash Election or a Common Unit
Election is validly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock,
any subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock shall
automatically revoke such election. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting such Election Form, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of such shares of Company Common Stock prior to the
Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made
and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good-faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. None of ETP, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.

 



\- 7 -  Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Mailing Date, ETP shall appoint an exchange
agent mutually acceptable to ETP and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. Prior to
the Effective Time, (i) ETP shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares
(other than the Cancelled Shares and the Subsidiary Shares), certificates
representing the Common Units issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and Section
5.6(a) (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by ETP if
uncertificated Common Units will be issued) and an amount of cash sufficient
to effect the delivery of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares). Following
the Effective Time, ETP agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to
Section 2.3(c). All such certificates representing Common Units and cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent from time to time is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth business day
following the Effective Time, ETP shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and that risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the certificates or book-entry notations
representing Shares (in each case, " _Certificates_ ") in exchange for, as
applicable, cash Merger Consideration, certificates representing whole Common
Units (or book-entry notations, if uncertificated Common Units will be
issued), cash in lieu of any fractional Common Units pursuant to Section
2.1(d) and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c). Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, that number of
whole Common Units (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 and payment
by cash or check of that amount of cash Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, that amount of cash in lieu of
fractional Common Units which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c) to
which such holder is entitled, and the Shares represented by the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any cash payment
is to be made to, or any Common Units constituting any part of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of, a person other than the
person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to the payment or registration thereof that the surrendered
Certificate be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment or delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.3(c)) upon such surrender. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.3(c).

 



\- 8 -  (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No distributions with
respect to Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
Common Units represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
Common Units shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(d),
until such Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this Article
II. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i)
promptly after such surrender, (A) the number of whole Common Units (after
taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, (B) payment by cash or check of
that amount of cash Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1, (C) that amount of cash in lieu of fractional Common
Units which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d), and (D) the
amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Common Units and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole Common Units.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.3(c) shall be
deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates. After
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to ETP upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
ETP for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional Common Units pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any distributions
pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by ETP, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as ETP may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Share represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

 



\- 9 -  (g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, the ETP Parties, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.4 Withholding (a). Each of the ETP Parties, Merger Sub and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
ETP Parties, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

representation is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or in

resulting from or arising out of (A) any changes or developments in the
industries in which ETP or any of its Subsidiaries conducts its business, (B)

exception in this clause (H) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any event, change, effect, development or occurrence
underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, an ETP Material
Adverse Effect so long as it is not otherwise excluded by this definition) or
(I) any changes in the share price or trading volume of the Common Units or in
ETPs credit rating (provided that the exception in this clause (I) shall not

subclauses (A)-(B) and (E)-(G) of this clause (iii), to the extent
disproportionately affecting ETP and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,
the ETP SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the ETP
SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

schedules) of ETP included in the ETP SEC Documents fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of ETP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the

for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP

maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. ETPs disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by ETP in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ETPs management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ETPs internal control over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year
ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of Parent has
disclosed to ETPs auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors
of Parent GP (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect ETPs ability to
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in ETPs

or revocation thereof would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP
Material Adverse Effect. ETP is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, in

this Section 5.4 or pursuant to the Additional Transactions, from the date
hereof and prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination

any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding the

properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to any
person (other than any ETP Party, Merger Sub or

 



\- 53 -   their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates or
Representatives) in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with a person (other than any
ETP Party, Merger Sub or their respective directors, officers, employees,
affiliates or Representatives) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend) any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any letter of intent, term
sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, exchange agreement or any other agreement providing for any
Acquisition Transaction or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (vi) unless the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Board of
Directors of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) amend or grant
any waiver, release or modification under, or fail to enforce, any standstill
or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) take any action to make the
provisions of Subchapters F, G and H of Chapter 25 of the PBCL inapplicable to
any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction or (vii) resolve or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the first sentence of
this Section 5.4, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company, or the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
through any officer, employee or Representative, may (x) furnish non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, and afford
access to the business, properties, books or records of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries to, any person and (y) engage and participate in discussions
and negotiations with any person, in each case in response to an unsolicited,
written and bona fide Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of the
Company, prior to taking any such particular action, concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer if
(1) such Acquisition Proposal was received after the date of this Agreement
and did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.4, (2) the
Company provides to ETP the notice required by Section 5.4(b) with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, and (3) the Company furnishes any non-public
information provided to the maker of the Acquisition Proposal only pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement between the Company and such person with
provisions that are not less restrictive to such person than the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be promptly provided to
ETP (it being agreed that such confidentiality agreement between the Company
and such person shall permit such person to make any Acquisition Proposal to
the Board of Directors of the Company), and to the extent non-public
information that has not been made available to ETP is made available to the
maker of the Acquisition Proposal, provide or make available such non-public
information to ETP substantially concurrent with the time that it is provided
to such other person. Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company,
or the Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through any officer,
employee or Representative, from (1) informing any person that the Company is
party to this Agreement and informing such person of the restrictions that
are set forth in Section 5.4, or (2) disclosing factual information regarding
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or
the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the
party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise; _provided_ that, in the case of this clause
(2), (x) the Company shall in good faith determine that such information,
facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under applicable Law or
that

 



\- 54 -   failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) the Company complies
with the obligations set forth in the proviso in Section 5.4(h). So long as
the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with this Section
5.4, none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its Representatives
from contacting any persons or group of persons who has made an Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification
of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition
Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Offer,
and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 5.4.

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after its or any of its Representatives receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding
an Acquisition Transaction or non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, advise
ETP (orally and in writing) of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request
(including providing the identity of the person making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy
of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and any related draft
agreements and (y) if oral, a reasonably detailed summary thereof), in each
case including any modifications thereto. The Company shall keep ETP informed
in all material respects on a prompt basis with respect to any change to the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours following any such change).

(c) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions existing
as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Representatives and any person (other than ETE, Parent, ETP, Merger Sub or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives) that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f),
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof may
(i) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Recommendation in a
manner adverse to ETP, or (ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this Section 5.4(d), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may at any
time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, make a Change of
Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), if
(and only if): (i) (A) a written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result
from a material breach of Section 5.4(a)) is made by a third party after the
date hereof, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Offer and (C) following consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company determines that the failure to
make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this

 



\- 55 -   Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and (ii) (A) the Company provides ETP seventy-two (72) hours
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include the information with respect to such Superior Offer that is specified
in Section 5.4(b), (B) after providing such notice and prior to making such
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Offer or taking any
action pursuant to Section 7.1(h) with respect to a Superior Offer, the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with ETP during such seventy-two (72)
hour period (to the extent that ETP desires to negotiate) to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, such that the Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Offer, and (C) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement
offered in writing by ETP, and following such seventy-two (72) hour period,
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Offer if such changes offered in
writing by ETP were to be given effect; _provided_ that, in the event that the
Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section 5.4(e).

 

(f) Other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject to
Section 5.4(e) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.4(f)), nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the
Company from making a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event to the extent that (i) the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation would
be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (ii) (A) the Company provides ETP seventy-two (72)
hours prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and prior
to making such Change of Recommendation, the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with ETP during such seventy-two (72) hour period (to the extent that
ETP desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would not permit the Board of Directors to make a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.4(f), and (C) the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by ETP, and following such seventy-two (72) hour
period, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law would continue to require a Change of
Recommendation with respect to an Intervening Event.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, with
respect to SXL and its Subsidiaries, the Companys obligations under this
Section 5.4 to take an action or not to take an action shall only apply to the
extent permitted by the organizational documents and governance arrangements
of SXL and its Subsidiaries and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, SXL or the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Board of Directors of SXL GP from taking and disclosing to its
equityholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" letter

 



\- 56 -   or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses
or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless
the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not
changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company.

Section 5.5 _Filings; Other Actions_. (a) As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, ETP and the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, which will include the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of ETP and the Company shall use reasonable best

effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the

and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the

as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be made by ETP or the Company, as applicable,
without the others prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other party a reasonable

has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Common Units issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the
SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or

communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to ETP or the Company, or
any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
ETP or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders, to be held as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, to consider
the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Shareholders  Meeting_"). The Company
will, except in the case of a Change of Recommendation, through its Board of
Directors, recommend that its shareholders adopt this Agreement and will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and to take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of its shareholders required by the
rules of the NYSE or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may, in consultation with ETP, postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders
Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of quorum, (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure which the Company has determined after consultation with
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such

the shareholders of the Company prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting
and (iv) if the Company has delivered any notice contemplated by Section
5.4(e) and the time periods contemplated by Section 5.4(e) have not expired. 

 



\- 59 -  Section 5.6 _Equity-Based Awards_. (a) Each option to purchase Shares (each,
a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time,
become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash Election
Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company
Option. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the
immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within five
business days following the Effective Time.

(b) Each award of restricted share units that corresponds to Shares and vests
solely based on the passage of time (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award multiplied by (ii)
the Per Unit Cash Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall pay to the
holders of Company RSU Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately
preceding sentence (together with any dividend equivalents corresponding to
Company RSU Awards that vest in accordance with this Section 5.6(b)), less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payments, within five business days following the Effective Time.

(c) Each award of performance share units that corresponds to Shares (each, a
" _Company PSU Award_ " and the Company PSU Awards, together with the Company
Options and the Company RSU Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award (determined pursuant
to the last two sentences of this Section 5.6(c)) multiplied by (ii) the Per
Unit Cash Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holders of
Company PSU Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding
sentence (together with any dividend equivalents corresponding to Company PSU
Awards that vest in accordance with this Section 5.6(c)), less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment,
within five business days following the Effective Time. For any Company PSU
Award with respect to which the Effective Time occurs prior to the first
anniversary of the grant date for such Company PSU Award and for any Company
PSU Award granted in 2012, the number of Shares subject to such Company PSU
Award shall be equal to the target number of Shares subject to the Company PSU
Award. For any Company PSU Award with respect to which the Effective Time
occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date for such Company
PSU Award (other than any Company PSU Award granted in 2012), the number of
Shares subject to such Company PSU Award shall be equal to the greater of (x)
the target number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award, and (y) the
number of Shares that would be earned with respect to such Company PSU Award
based on the Companys actual performance immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



\- 60 -  (d) Each award under the Companys Leadership Recognition Plan that
corresponds to Shares (each, a " _Company SLRP Award_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company SLRP Award multiplied by (ii) the Cash Election
Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holders of Company
SLRP Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence,
less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payments, within five business days following the Effective Time.

(e) Each account under the Company Directors Deferred Compensation Plan
I, the Company Directors Deferred Compensation Plan II, the Company Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Company Executive Involuntary Deferred Compensation
Plan that is denominated in Shares (each, a " _Company Deferred
Share Account_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into a vested
obligation to pay cash with a value equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Deferred Share Account multiplied by
(ii) the Cash Election Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall pay to
each holder of a Company Deferred Share Account, at such time as such Company
Deferred Share Account would have been settled under its terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the cash amounts described in the
immediately preceding sentence, plus, except with respect to the Company
Executive Involuntary Deferred Compensation Plan, interest accruing at 120% of
the long-term applicable federal rate from and including the Effective Time,
through and including the payment date, less such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payments. 

(f) For purposes of this Section 5.6, " _Per Unit Cash Consideration_ " means
(i) for Company PSU Awards and Company RSU Awards granted prior to March 1,
2012, the greater of (A) the Cash Election Consideration, and (B) the highest
trading price per Share as reflected in the _Wall Street Journal_ during the
sixty-day period immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) for
Company PSU Awards and Company RSU Awards granted on or after March 1, 2012,

(g) The Company shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.6.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, ETP
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to honor all Company Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements
and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time as such agreements and arrangements may be modified
or terminated in accordance with their terms from time to time. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
to provide to each of the individuals employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the

 



\- 61 -   Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and
target cash bonus opportunity that, in each case, is no less favorable than
was provided to the Current Employee immediately before the Effective Time,
and (ii) all other compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (A) provided to such Current
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity-based
compensation), or (B) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (excluding equity-based compensation). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (x) ETP shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Current Employee whose
employment terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time
(or such longer period required by an applicable Company Benefit Plan) with
severance payments and benefits at levels and in amounts no less favorable
than the levels and amounts in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (y) during such one-year period following the Effective Time (or such
longer period required by an Company Benefit Plan), severance benefits
offered to each Current Employee shall be determined without taking into
account any reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid to such
Current Employee.

 

(b) For all purposes (including vesting and eligibility to participate and
level of benefits but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of ETP and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Current Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Current Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Current Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Current Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Current Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Current Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Current Employee, ETP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the New
Plans, was subject to such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and ETP
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Benefit Plans_ " means, with respect to any entity, any compensation or
employee benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements or other arrangements,
whether or not "employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
")), whether or not subject to ERISA, including bonus, cash or equity-based
incentive, deferred compensation, stock purchase, health,

(c) The Company shall have the right, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to pay to each Current Employee who participates in the Companys Senior
Executive Incentive Plan a pro-rata cash bonus in respect of the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs based on target performance, for the
portion of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
commencing January 1 through and including the date on which the Effective
Time occurs.

(d) ETP hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)

Effective Time, as applicable.

(e) If requested by ETP, subject to the terms of any such Company Benefit Plan
and applicable Law, the Company shall both (i) terminate any Company Benefit
Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code Section
401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii)
fully vest each Continuing Employee in his or her account balance in such
Company 401(k) Plan, in each case, effective at least one day prior to the
Closing Date (the " _ERISA Effective Date_ "). Prior to the ERISA Effective
Date, the Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of its or, as
applicable, its Subsidiarys Board of Directors authorizing such termination
and amending any such Company 401(k) Plan commensurate with its termination to
the extent necessary to comply with all applicable Laws. The Company shall
also take and/or cause its Subsidiaries to take such other actions in
furtherance of the termination of each Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may
reasonably require, including such actions as Parent may require prior to the
Effective Time to support Parent obtaining a determination letter with respect
to the termination of each Company 401(k) Plan following the ERISA Effective
Date. In addition, unless otherwise determined by Parent, the Company shall
take such actions as may be necessary to eliminate, as of no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time, from any Company 401(k) Plan, any
investment fund, election or alternative that provides for an investment
directly or indirectly in shares of Company Common Stock or that provides for
payments to be made to a participant by reference to the value of Company
Common Stock.

(f) In the event of the termination, pursuant to Section 5.7(e), of
any Company 401(k) Plan (each such terminated Company 401(k) Plan, a "
_Terminated Company 401(k) Plan_ "), Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall
cause a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, that includes a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code and that is established or maintained by Parent or
its applicable Subsidiary (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to immediately accept
eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to such individuals account balances (including loans) under such
Terminated Company 401(k) Plan, if elected by any such individuals. The
rollovers described herein shall comply with applicable Law, and Parent and
its Subsidiaries

 



\- 63 -   shall make all filings and take any actions required of such party under
applicable Law in connection therewith. Current and former employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who are participants in a Terminated Company
401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be eligible
immediately as of the Effective Time to participate in a Parent 401(k) Plan.

 

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be construed as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Benefit Plan or to prevent the amendment or
termination of any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. Nothing in this
Section 5.7 shall limit the right of ETP, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee
at any time, subject to any rights to severance or other separation benefits
accrued as of the applicable termination date under a Company Benefit Plan.
Without limiting the generality of Section 8.13, the provisions of
this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former director, officer, employee, other service provider
or independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement (including any Benefit Plan of the ETP Parties or their
Subsidiaries) for any purpose.

 

(h) The Company agrees that prior to the occurrence of a "Potential Change in
Control" as such term is defined in either of the Rabbi Trust Agreements, the
Company shall cause the Rabbi Trust Agreements to be amended to provide as
follows: (i) the Legal Defense Fund Amount (as defined in either of the Rabbi
Trust Agreements) will not be funded into either of the trusts described in
the Rabbi Trust Agreements, (ii) no amounts in respect of the indemnification
agreements set forth on Schedule 2.1 of either of the Rabbi Trust Agreements
(or any other indemnification agreements) will be funded into either of
the trusts described in the Rabbi Trust Agreements (and Schedule 2.1 of each
of the Rabbi Trust Agreements will be amended to remove all indemnification
agreements from each such schedule), (iii) any amounts funded into the trust
described in the Executive Trust Agreement in respect of the Sunoco, Inc.
Special Executive Severance Plan will be returned to the Surviving Corporation
on the 30 month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Reversion Date_ ") to
the extent such amounts have not been paid, and are not owing, to
participants as of the Reversion Date, and (iv) the reference to the Sunoco,
Inc. Special Employee Severance Plan will be removed from Schedule 2.1 of the
Executive Trust Agreement and the reference to the Sunoco, Inc. Non-Employee

Trust Agreement. The Company shall provide drafts of such amendments to ETP
prior to execution thereof and shall consider in good faith any of ETPs
comments thereon.

shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to file applications for
any FERC approval, and any other filings, determined to be required as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than 30
days after the date hereof, and shall make such filings jointly if

permit counsel for the other parties a reasonable opportunity to review and
provide comments thereon, and consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity (or members of their respective staffs) to the extent
permitted by Law. Each of the Company and the ETP Parties agrees not to
participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by

 



\- 65 -   telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed

extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the other
parties the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances.

Parties, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their best efforts to satisfy

Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and
all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Entity may assert under Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under Regulatory Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur no
later than the End Date, including without limitation, (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate

terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or the ETP Parties or their respective Subsidiaries

their ability to retain or hold, one or more of their or their Subsidiaries

interests, product lines or properties, in each case as may be required in
order to obtain all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations or to avoid the commencement of any action to
prohibit the Merger, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Merger or
delay the Closing beyond the End Date.

(e) The ETP Parties and the Company shall not take, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries not to take, any action with the intention to,
or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the obtaining of
clearance or any necessary consent of any Governmental Entity under any
Regulatory Law or the expiration of the required waiting period under any
Regulatory Law.

 



\- 66 -  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.8 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied in all respects with its obligations
under this Agreement, including this Section 5.8.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act of
1890, as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, the Robinson-
Patman Act, as amended, the FPA, the NGA, the ICA, the NGPA, the PUHCA, the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal

prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization, restraint of trade, price discrimination or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition or (ii) protect the national
security or the national economy of any nation.

Section 5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and ETP shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Except (a) following any Change of
Recommendation or (b) with respect to action taken by the Company or its
Board of Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.4, so long

efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent
they have not been previously issued or disclosed, shall be consistent with

securities exchange, each party shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or public statement with respect to the Merger and, subject

that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether

favor of the current or former, directors, officers or employees, as the case
may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in
any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, ETP and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation,

 



\- 67 -   indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any of its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving Corporations articles of
incorporation and bylaws in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim. From and after the Effective Time, ETP shall assume, be jointly
and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 5.11 without limit as to time.

(b) ETP and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
(and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any costs or expenses (including
advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
consistent with the Company Organizational Documents to repay such amounts if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities as
such occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other
fiduciary of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company). In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such
Action. 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, ETP shall cause to be
maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or arising on or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_
, that ETP shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of the coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained
pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. If the Company in its sole discretion

 



\- 68 -   elects, then the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail
policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy exceed six (6) times
the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased, ETP shall have
no further obligations under this Section 5.11(c).

(d) ETP shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the PBCL or otherwise.

 

(f) In the event ETP, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of ETP or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of
such party set forth in this Section 5.11. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
5.11 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 

(g) The obligations of ETP and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.11 shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and
legal representatives) to whom this Section 5.11 applies without the consent
of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the
Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.11 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.11, and (ii) this Section 5.11 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified
Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal representatives
against ETP and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and
assigns. 

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the ETP Parties or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and the ETP Parties shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its operations.

 



\- 69 -  Section 5.13 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any
real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned
directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall
be borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability
of shareholders of the Company.

Section 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, ETP and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Common Units (including derivative
securities with respect to Common Units) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect
to ETP, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.15 _Federal Income Tax Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement
intend that the exchange of Company Common Stock for Common Units pursuant to
the Merger qualify as an exchange to which Section 721(a) of the Code applies
and agree to file all federal (and, to the extent applicable, state and local)
income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment.

 

Section 5.16 _NYSE Listing_. ETP shall cause the Common Units to be issued in
the Merger and such other Common Units to be reserved for issuance in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.17 _Financing Assistance_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with
any financing by Parent, ETP or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or otherwise, in each case as may be reasonably
requested by ETP, Merger Sub or their Representatives. Without limiting the

Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any other liability in
connection with any financing prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) ETP shall, promptly upon request

to permit the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, shall
consult with the ETP Parties on the terms of such amendment and shall
reasonably cooperate to implement any additional

satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys willful and intentional
material breach of any material provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII. 

_TERMINATION_

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after any approval of
the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and ETP;

(b) by either the Company or ETP, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or prior to December 31, 2012 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing, other than
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c), shall have been
satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, the End Date
may be extended by either ETP or the Company from time to time by written
notice to the other party up to a date not beyond March 31, 2013, the latest
of any of which dates shall thereafter be deemed to be the End Date; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to a party if (i) the failure of
the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the material breach by such
party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such
party set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the other party has filed (and is
then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as permitted by Section
8.5;

(c) by either the Company or ETP, if an injunction shall have been entered
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to a party if such injunction was
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

 

(d) by either the Company or ETP, if the Shareholders Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company
Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

(e) by the Company, if ETP or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it
occurred or was continuing 

 



\- 75 -   to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and (ii) by its nature, cannot be
cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach or failure is capable of being
cured by the End Date, ETP does not diligently attempt or ceases to diligently
attempt to cure such breach or failure after receiving written notice from the
Company describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail (provided that
the Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein);

(f) by ETP, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) and (ii) by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach or failure
is capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company does not diligently
attempt or ceases to diligently attempt to cure such breach or failure after
receiving written notice from ETP describing such breach or failure
in reasonable detail (provided that ETP is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

(g) by ETP, prior to the Company Shareholder Approval (i) in the event of a
Change of Recommendation or (ii) the Company shall have Willfully Breached any
of its obligations under Section 5.4, other than in the case where (A) such
Willful Breach is a result of an isolated action by a person that is a
Representative of the Company (other than a director or senior officer of the
Company), (B) such Willful Breach was not caused by, or within the knowledge
of, the Company, (C) the Company takes appropriate actions to remedy such
Willful Breach upon discovery thereof and (D) Parent is not significantly
harmed as a result thereof; and

 

(h) by the Company, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and if
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
Section 5.4, in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Offer (which definitive agreement shall be entered into concurrently
with, or promptly following, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(h)); _provided_ that any such purported termination by the
Company pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) shall be void and of no force or
effect unless the Company pays to ETP the Breakup Fee in accordance with
Section 7.3(a).

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall terminate
(except for the provisions of Section 7.3 and Article VIII), and there shall

provided in Section 7.3 and, subject to Section 7.3(f), liability arising out
of or the result of, fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any
covenant or agreement or willful or intentional breach of any representation

by ETP, on the earlier of the public announcement of the Companys entry into

of same day federal funds to the account specified by ETP within three (3)
business days following termination of this Agreement, and, if within twelve

be consummated after such twelve-month period), an Acquisition Transaction,
then the Company shall pay to ETP an amount equal to the Breakup Fee minus
the ETP Expenses previously paid or reimbursed by the Company, by wire

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that in on event shall
the ETP Expenses exceed $20 million.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Breakup Fee_ " means $225 million.

 

(i) Upon payment of the Breakup Fee and/or the ETP Expenses, as applicable, to
ETP pursuant to Section 7.3(a), 7.3(b), 7.3(c), 7.3(d) or 7.3(e), the Company
shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to ETP or its unitholders; _provided_ that
nothing herein shall release any party from liability arising out of or the
result of fraud. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Breakup Fee, as applicable, on more than one
occasion. In addition, the parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements,
neither party would enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay
promptly the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company will also
pay to ETP interest on the unpaid amount under this Section 7.3, accruing from
its due date, at an interest rate per annum equal to two percentage points in
excess of the prime commercial lending rate quoted by _The Wall Street
Journal_ and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees) in

effective at the beginning of the date of such change in such prime rate.

hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b)

any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the

ETE or one of its wholly owned Subsidiaries to acquire up to 50% of the
capital stock of Merger Sub must be made within 30 days of the date of this
Agreement and shall specify the terms of any such acquisition and any related
transactions (collectively, the " _Merger Sub Transactions_ "); (B) if a
request for a Merger Sub Transaction shall be made, the ETP Parties
shall provide such additional information related to the Merger Sub
Transactions as the Company may reasonably request within 10 days of such
request; (C) the Company shall evaluate the Merger Sub Transactions in good
faith; (D) if the Company shall consent to the Merger Sub Transactions, then
ETE shall agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as if it were ETP
with respect to (w) the representations and warranties of ETP under Sections
4.1, 4.3 and 4.12, (x) the obligations of ETP under Section 5.3(a), 5.5(a)
and Section 5.8, (y) the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a), 6.2(b) and
6.2(c) and (z) the termination provisions set forth in Section 7.1(e); and (E)
the Merger Sub Transactions shall be treated as one of the Additional
Transactions for purposes of the definition of "Company Material Adverse
Effect" and Sections 5.1 and 5.4. For purposes of clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence, there shall be a presumption that such consent has been
withheld unreasonably if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with legal and financial advisors, that (A) the
Merger Sub Transactions would not reasonably be expected to delay, impede or
prevent the Merger, taking into account the provisions of Section 5.5(a) and
Section 5.8 that will be applicable to the Merger Sub Transactions, (B) the
Merger Sub Transactions would not adversely affect any of the credit ratings
of the senior unsecured indebtedness of ETP pro forma for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the time of the execution of this Agreement
as evidenced by affirmations of ETPs credit ratings by each of Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poors Rating Services, a division of
The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and (C) in each quarter thereafter, the Merger
Sub Transactions would reasonably be expected to (1) increase the future cash
distributions and distributable cash flow per Common Unit, without increasing
indebtedness of ETP, as compared to the projected future cash distributions
and distributable cash flow per Common Unit following the consummation of the
Merger without effectuating the Merger Sub Transactions, (2) result in the
same degree or greater certainty of achieving those distributions and cash
flows, as compared to the degree of certainty of achieving
those distributions and cash flows following the consummation of the Merger
without effectuating the Merger Sub Transactions, (3) result in those cash
flows being valued at least as favorably by the market, as compared to the
value that the market is expected to value such cash flows following the

 



\- 82 -   consummation of the Merger without effectuating the Merger Sub Transactions,
and (4) result in no diminution in the intrinsic value of the Common Units, as
compared to the value of such Common Units following the consummation of the
Merger without effectuating the Merger Sub Transactions. Subject to the first
sentence of this Section 8.8, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall
be null and void.

 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this Agreement is not intended to
grant standing to any person other than the parties hereto.

any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by

expand the obligations of ETE under this Agreement or the Partnership
Agreement Amendment or (ii) amend any provision of Section 5.2(b)(iv)(E) or
Article VIII in a manner that would apply ETE, also in writing and signed by
ETE) or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to
be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of Company
Shareholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further
approval of the shareholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such
amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders of
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party
hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
