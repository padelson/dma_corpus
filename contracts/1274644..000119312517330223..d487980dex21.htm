contingent payments, if any, net to the seller in cash, without interest,
upon the achievement of certain milestones, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of a contingent value rights agreement, substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , to be entered into between
Parent and Continental Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Rights Agent_ ")

(the " _CVR Agreement_ ") (the Closing Amount plus one (1) CVR, collectively,
or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, and as may be
adjusted in accordance with _Section 1.1(h)_, being the " _Offer Price_ "),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with
the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby (i)
each issued and outstanding Share not owned by Parent, Purchaser or the
Company as of the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash,
without interest, and (ii) the Company shall become a direct wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser has, by unanimous vote of all of the directors, (a) declared it

Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, (b) approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (c) resolved that the Merger shall
be effected under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved a resolution
recommending to the stockholders of the Company that they accept the Offer and
tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer; WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger may be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be

this Agreement, certain individuals and entities, in their capacity as
stockholders of the Company, has concurrently herewith entered into a Tender
and Support Agreement (collectively, the " _Tender and Support Agreements_ ")

subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely
provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to Sections
1.1(e) and 1.2(b)), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)

Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition, and the other conditions set
forth in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ ") (without limiting

Expiration Date, in each case, except as provided in Section 1.1(c) or 1.1(d)
of this Agreement. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date

terminated in accordance with Section 7.1. 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)

Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent date to which
the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the parties

an additional period of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for the minimum period

Agreement in compliance with Section 7.1 and (y) the Outside Date (such

Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately,

3  " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer
to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of

respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (y) to not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by Parent or
Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal
counsel all information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders
that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its counsel shall be

comments (including oral comments). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the
Offer.

(f) _Funds_. Without limiting the generality of Section 8.16, Parent shall
cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of
their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the
Offer.

 

(g) _CVR Agreement_. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent, the
Rights Agent and Guarantor shall enter into the CVR Agreement

reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), stock dividend or any other similar event, then the Offer Price

 



4  shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such event so as to provide Parent
and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall
the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant to this Agreement after giving
effect to any such event exceed the amount that would have been payable
pursuant to this Agreement had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in
this Section 1.1(h) shall permit the Company to take any action with respect

after the Expiration Date accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the "

pay for such Shares.

 

SECTION 1.2 _Company Actions_.

each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

Company Recommendation and include the fairness opinion of the Companys
financial advisor referenced in _Section 3.18_ and the notice and other
information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the

shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (A) to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (B) to not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become

(including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
and the Company shall give

 



5  reasonable consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel.
The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments
(including oral comments) the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
those comments (including oral comments). The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof
furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case accurate and complete as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer and the Merger (the date of the list used
to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9
are first disseminated, which date shall not be more than ten (10) days prior
to the date the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated,
the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Subject to applicable Law, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request by the Company, deliver,
and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver,
to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from
such information then in their possession or control, and, if requested by the

or Purchaser:

 

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the

cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Purchaser or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Excluded

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one

shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class or
shall have different terms, in each case as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or any other similar event, then the Merger Consideration shall be

to its securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 2.9 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_.

 

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, each holder of an
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be
provided with written notice that such holder shall, during the period
beginning on the date of such notice and ending on the Business Day preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Option Exercise Period_ "), have the right to
exercise such Company Stock Option, with such exercise conditioned on the
occurrence of the Effective Time.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option with respect to which
the applicable exercise price per Share is less than the Closing Amount
(each, an " _In the Money Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not
exercised during the Option Exercise Period, shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time in exchange for the right of the holder of such In the Money
Company Stock Option to receive, for each Share underlying such In the Money
Company Stock Option, (A) an amount in cash, without interest and subject
to deduction for any required withholding Tax, equal to the excess, if any,
of the Closing Amount over the applicable exercise price for such Share, with
the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent, and (B)
one (1) CVR.

 



8 (iii) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option other than an In the
Money Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and not exercised during the Option
Exercise Period (each, an " _Out of the Money Company Stock Option_ "), shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive
one or more cash payments, if any, from Parent with respect to each Share
subject to the Out of the Money Company Stock Option upon each Milestone
Payment Date (as defined in the CVR Agreement) in an amount, without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax, equal to (A) the
amount by which the Per Share Value Paid exceeds the exercise price payable
per Share subject to such Out of the Money Company Stock Option, less (B) the
amount of all payments previously paid with respect to such Out of the Money
Company Stock Option pursuant to this Section 2.9(a)(iii). On or prior to the
date hereof, Parent and the Company have agreed upon a model calculating the
gross cash amounts payable with respect to each Out of the Money Company Stock
Option, if any, at each Milestone Payment Date, which model is attached as
_Section 2.9(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any Out of the Money Company Stock Options
with an exercise price payable per Share equal to or greater than $4.10 shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time without any consideration payable
therefor (such cancelled Out of the Money Company Stock Options, the "
_Cancelled Company Stock Options_ ").

(b) _Company Warrants_.

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, each holder of an
outstanding Company warrant (" _Company Warrant_ ") shall be provided with

" _Warrant Exercise Period_ "), have the right to exercise such Company
Warrant, with such exercise conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective
Time.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and not exercised during the Warrant
Exercise Period shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the
right of the holder of such Company Warrant to receive, for each Share
underlying such Company Warrant, (i) an amount in cash, without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax, equal to the
excess, if any, of the Closing Amount over the applicable exercise price for
such Share, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the
nearest cent, and (ii) one (1) CVR; provided, however, that any such Company
Warrant with respect to which the applicable exercise price per Share is
greater than the Closing Amount shall be cancelled in exchange for no Merger
Consideration (such cancelled Company Warrants, the " _Cancelled Company
Warrants_ ").

 



9 (c) At the Effective Time, each RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully
vested and shall be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the
right of the holder of such RSU to receive, for each Share underlying such
RSU, (i) an amount in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax, equal to the Closing Amount, with the aggregate
amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent, and (ii) one (1) CVR.

event, not later than the second regularly scheduled payroll
date thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll
system the Closing Amount due and payable under this Section 2.9 to each
holder of In the Money Company Stock Options and RSUs.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices to each holder of Company Warrants stating that such Company Warrants

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices to each holder of Company Stock Options or RSUs setting forth each
holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plan, and stating
that such Company Stock Options or RSUs shall be treated in the manner set
forth in this Section 2.9.

(g) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Stock Plans shall terminate and (ii) no
holder of a Company Stock Option or RSU shall have any rights with respect
thereto to acquire the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries, except the right to receive the payment
contemplated by this Section 2.9 in cancellation and settlement thereof.

SECTION 2.10 _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall appoint Continental
Transfer and Trust Company to act as depository agent (the " _Depository Agent_
") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Closing Amount to which
holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_,
and to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares
to receive the aggregate Closing Amount to which holders of such Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_. Promptly after (and in any
event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after) the Offer Acceptance
Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Depository
Agent, to be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares to
receive the aggregate Closing Amount to which holders of such Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_, cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Closing Amount payable pursuant to 
_Section 1.1(i)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, to be held in trust for the
benefit of the holders of the Shares to receive the aggregate Closing Amount
to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section
2.8(a)_, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Closing Amount pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ (together with the amount
deposited pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
fund payments of the Closing Amount due pursuant to the Offer and the Merger.
In addition, on or prior to the second

 



10  regularly scheduled payroll date after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Surviving Corporation cash in U.S.
dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Closing Amount payable
to the holders of Company Stock Options and RSUs in accordance with this
Article II, but only to the extent the Surviving Corporation does not have the
cash on hand to pay such amounts.

 

(b) At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent, the Rights Agent and
Guarantor shall enter into the CVR Agreement.

 

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and, in any event, not later than seven
(7) Business Days following the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an
outstanding certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto (including instructions for providing to the
Paying Agent required Tax documentation, including, as applicable, a properly
executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8). Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal and
Tax documentation, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by Parent or the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.11), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(d) The Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated
Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), if any, whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
receipt of an "agents message" and the required Tax documentation by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request), the Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry
Share, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled.

 

(e) No interest will be paid to or accrued for the benefit of holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(f) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and
the Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 



11 (g) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.10, each Certificate
and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, without any interest thereon.

(h) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
Excluded Shares) shall be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

 

(i) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) no investment of such cash shall
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) such investments in all events shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days, or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit
of, the United States of America. If for any reason (including investment
losses) the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of
the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent
shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal
to such deficiency. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (at
Parents election).

(j) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received
with respect thereto) which remains unclaimed at the one year anniversary of
the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation, and thereafter holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(k) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares and
Company Warrants for the Merger Consideration.

(l) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Paying Agent, of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent
or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



12 (m) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser, the Company, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the

perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to
appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance

appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II, without interest. The
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any
other instruments received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle
or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of, any such demands, or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration paid to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares that have become
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

SECTION 5.2 _Unsolicited Proposals_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(c)_ and except as expressly

proposals or offers that constitute, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding

businesses, properties, assets or personnel of the Company or any of its

Acquisition Proposal, or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating an

that all non-public information previously provided by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such third party be returned or

44 Agreement. It is agreed that (1) any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.2(a) by any officer, director or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.2 by the
Company and (2) any inquiry, proposal or offer that results from any material
violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such Representatives included in the
foregoing clause (1)) shall be deemed to be not in compliance with this
Section 5.2.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time on or after the date hereof prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
(i) the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.2_ and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, then the Company shall notify Parent in writing of such
determination promptly after the Company Board makes such determination (and
in any event within 24 hours after making such determination) and the Company
may (A) furnish information and data with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and
afford such third party access to the businesses, properties, assets and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) enter into, maintain and participate in
discussions or negotiations with the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such discussions or
negotiations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will substantially
concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such third party, which was
not previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may direct
any Persons to this Agreement, including the specific provisions of this
_Section 5.2_. 

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent of the Companys (or any of its Representatives)
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or of any request for discussion,
negotiation or information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include
a copy of the applicable written Acquisition Proposal (or, if oral, the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal) and the identity
of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding
any such Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including any change in price or form of consideration or other material
amendment thereto), including by providing a copy of material documentation
relating thereto that is exchanged between the third party (or its
Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and the Company (or its
Representatives) within 24 hours after receipt thereof.

 



45 (d) The Company agrees to enforce, and not to release or permit the release of
any Person from, or to modify or waive or permit the waiver or termination of
any provision of, any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (including any
standstill or similar provisions contained therein), other than to the extent
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to provide such waiver, release or termination
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(e) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms not less restrictive in the
aggregate to the receiving party thereto than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not contain any
"standstill" or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making, or
amendment, of any Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
confidentiality agreement may contain provisions that permit the Company to
comply with the provisions of _Section 5.2_ and _5.3_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Person who has previously entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the Company relating to a potential acquisition of, or business
combination with, the Company shall not be required to enter into a new
or revised confidentiality agreement, and such existing confidentiality
agreement shall be deemed to be an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal from any third
party relating to any transaction or series of related transactions involving
any (i) acquisition or purchase by any third party, directly or indirectly, of
(A) 20% or more of the Common Stock, or any tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any third party beneficially owning 20%
or more of the Common Stock, or (B) 20% or more of the assets or businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend or other significant
corporate reorganization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
business of which constitutes 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, joint venture, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to
which the shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction
hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking
into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, and other
aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the third party making the
Acquisition Proposal, (A) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that
is more favorable to the Companys stockholders than the Offer and the Merger
(including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
writing prior to the time of such determination) and (B) is reasonably likely
of being completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ,"
references in the term "Acquisition Proposal" to (1) "20% or more" shall be
deemed to be references to "more than 50%" and (2) "80%" shall be deemed
references to "50%." 

 



46 SECTION 5.3 _Company Recommendation_

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(c)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw, qualify,
amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify, in any manner adverse to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent or Purchaser, the Companys recommending that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), or fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any third
party tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of Common Stock within
ten Business Days after commencement of such offer, (iv) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company to execute, or enter into, any
agreement, arrangement or understanding, including any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.2_) or (v) resolve or publicly propose to take any action described in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) (each of the foregoing actions described
in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

 

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
_Section 5.3(a)_, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in
response to either (1) a Superior Proposal that is first made after the date
hereof and did not result from a breach of Section 5.2 or this Section 5.3, or
(2) any material fact, event, change, development or circumstance that was
not known, or reasonably foreseeable, by the Company Board as of the date
hereof (or, if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of
which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) and not relating to (x) any
Acquisition Proposal or (y) any changes in the market price or trading volume
of Common Stock, in and of itself (it being understood that the facts or
occurrences giving rise or contributing to such change may be taken
into account) (such fact, event, change, development, circumstance or
consequences thereof, an " _Intervening Event_ "), the Company Board may, if
it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
(A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ and authorize the
Company to enter into a definitive agreement concerning a transaction that
constitutes a Superior Proposal (which agreement shall be entered into
substantially concurrently with such termination), subject in each case to
compliance with the terms of paragraph (ii) or iii below, as applicable.

 



47 (ii) In the case of a Superior Proposal, (x) no Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ may be made and (y) no termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ may be made, in either case:

 

(A) until after the fourth Business Day following written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if applicable, the material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the third party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of
any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, which shall
require a new notice period of four Business Days (provided, that the new
notice period shall be shortened to the later of (x) three Business Days
following Parents receipt of the new Notice of Superior Proposal or (y) the
expiration of the initial four Business Day period, if the only change to such
Superior Proposal is an increase in (without any change to the form of) the
per share merger consideration), and compliance with this _Section 5.3(b)_
with respect to such new notice);

(B) unless during such four Business Day period (or three Business Day
period, if applicable in accordance with paragraph (A) above), the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by
Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board to
maintain the Company Recommendation and not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement; and

 

(C) unless, after complying with paragraphs (A) and (B) above, the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, after giving due consideration to any
irrevocable changes proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent prior to
the expiration of such four Business Day period (or three Business Day period,
if applicable in accordance with paragraph (A) above).

 

(iii) In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ may be made:

(A) until after the four Business Day following written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action
and specifying the material facts underlying the determination by the Company
Board that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason for the Adverse
Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a " _Notice of Intervening
Event_ ");

(B) unless during such four Business Day period, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiate
with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 



48 (C) unless, by the expiration of such four Business Day period, the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel), taking into consideration any amendments to this
Agreement proposed by Parent, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

The provisions of this  _Section 5.3(b)(iii)_ shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening
Event, in which case such change shall require a new Notice of Intervening
Event and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions
of this _Section 5.3(b)(iii)_, except that any reference to four Business
Days shall instead be to the later of (x) three Business Days following
Parents receipt of the new Notice of Intervening Event or (y) the expiration
of the initial four Business Day period.

(c) Nothing contained in _Section 5.2_ or this  _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board or any committee thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or any disclosure requirements under
Applicable Law, or (iii) making any disclosure that constitutes a stop, look
and listen communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, which actions shall not
constitute or be deemed to constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the
properties, assets, offices, facilities, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and shall furnish Parent with such financial, operating and
other data and information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access or furnishing of information shall be conducted during normal business
hours, under the supervision of the Companys personnel and in such a manner
as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if legal counsel
for the Company reasonably determines that such disclosure would (a) be
subject to any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (b) contravene any
Law; provided, that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that
it is withholding such information or documents pursuant to clause (a) or (b)
above, and thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably
be expected to waive the applicable privilege or contravene the applicable
Law. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their Representatives not to use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 5.4 for any purpose unrelated to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



49 (b) Parent and Purchaser shall hold all documents and other information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Purchaser
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the letter agreement, dated as of January 20, 2017, between
the Company and Maillinckrodt LLC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or
information or notification provided or received by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement (or the Company Disclosure Letter) or prejudice
the rights and remedies of Parent or Purchaser hereunder. 

SECTION 5.5 _Efforts to Consummate the Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable (under Law or otherwise) in order to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest
practicable date, including by using and by causing its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to use its and their reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) prepare and file all forms, registrations and notices required under, and
seek any consents, authorizations or other approvals required under, any Law
or by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(ii) provide as promptly as possible to any applicable Governmental Entity all
information and documentary materials that may be requested pursuant to any
Antitrust Law;

(iii) obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from any
third Person, including as required under any Contract, each in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided that neither Parent nor
the Company shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other
consideration or make any other concession, waiver or amendment under any
Contract in connection with obtaining any consent without the prior written
consent of the other party; and

 

(iv) resolve all objections asserted with respect to this Agreement or the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby under any Law.

(b) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information and
provided that written materials may be redacted as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns, the parties shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the status of the matters addressed in this Section 5.5 and
shall cooperate with each other in connection with such matters, including
by:

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings or other written
submissions required or advisable under any Law and liaising with each other
in relation to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental
Entities, including cooperating in connection with their respective efforts
to obtain termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period and all
requisite clearances and approvals under any Antitrust Laws as promptly as
practicable and in any event before the Outside Date;

 



50 (ii) furnishing to outside antirust counsel for the other party all
information within its possession that is required for any application or
other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to applicable Law;

 

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any material communications from or
with any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by Law and
the applicable Governmental Entity that each of the parties has the
opportunity to attend any meeting or phone call with or other
appearance before any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
either party may limit attendance at such meeting or phone call to outside
antitrust counsel of the other party; and

 

(iv) cooperating with one another in connection with all analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that Parent shall,
on behalf of the parties and in consultation with the Company, control and
lead all communications and strategy relating to any investigation or other
inquiry that may arise in connection with any Antitrust Laws matters addressed
in this Section 5.5, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither
Parent nor the Company will consent or agree to extend the waiting period
under any Antitrust Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of Parent and Purchaser under
this Section 5.5 shall not include any obligation on Parent or Purchaser to
(i) agree to hold separate, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber, or cause a third party to purchase, any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines and/or any business or interest therein of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or (ii) agree to
any restrictions of any kind on, or modifications to, any of Parents or its
Affiliates business operations, as determined in Parents sole reasonable
discretion.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall
control the defense and settlement of all Stockholder Litigation initiated
against the Company, the Company Board or any of its or their Representatives.
The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify Parent in
writing of, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense and settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not communicate with any opposing party in any
Stockholder Litigation regarding any settlement thereof without either (i)
consulting with Parent in advance of such communication, taking into account
in good faith Parents views as to acceptable settlement terms and promptly
informing Parent of the contents of such communication, or (ii) allowing
Parents counsel to participate in such communication. The Company shall not
settle any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Without
otherwise limiting the Indemnified Partys rights with regard to the right of
counsel, following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to continue to retain Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel
selected by such Indemnified Parties prior to the Effective Time to defend any
Stockholder Litigation.

 



51 SECTION 5.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and any current or former employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") or as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, Parent will honor, and will cause its Subsidiaries to honor,
in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing employment, change in
control, retention and severance plan or agreement of or between the Company
or its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company, in
each case, in accordance with its terms in effect on the date hereof, listed
on  _Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, (ii) all obligations
in effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to outstanding restoration or
equity based plans, bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or agreements of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with its terms
in effect on the date hereof, listed on _Section 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ (excluding, for clarity, Annual Grants under the 2017 Non-
Employee Director Compensation Policy) and (iii) all vested and accrued
benefits under any employee benefit, employment compensation or similar plans,
programs, agreements or arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries listed
on _Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ and previously
provided to Parent. Parent acknowledges that the transaction contemplated
hereby shall constitute a "change in control" for purposes of each Company
Plan that uses such term or a similar term.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent
and a Company Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of their Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending twelve (12) months thereafter, to maintain for any Company
Employee who remains employed by Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries
(i) cash compensation levels (such term to include salary, bonus
opportunities, commissions and severance, but excluding equity, equity-based
and long-term incentive compensation) that are each substantially similar to
the overall cash compensation levels provided by Parent to its similarly
situated employees in the same or comparable geographic locations, and (ii)
benefits (including health, welfare and retirement benefits that in the
aggregate are substantially similar to those maintained for and provided by
Parent to its similarly situated employees in the same or comparable
geographic locations.

 

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plans), under (x) any severance-
related provisions of existing Company Plans described in  _Section 5.6(a)_
above and (y) any employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including
vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the
benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent,
its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees
service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities
(each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, except, in each case, to the
extent such treatment would

 



52  result in duplicative benefits or require recognition of service under a
newly established plan for which service is not taken into account for
employees of Parent. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall take commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be
waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give
effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations,
to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employees), other than the
parties hereto, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies with

may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any Action commenced or threatened in
writing against, relating to or involving the Offer, the Merger or the other

_however_ , that no such notification shall affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions
to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 



53 SECTION 5.9 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such Person currently covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 5.9(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the "
_Current Premium_ ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, which policies provide such Persons currently covered
by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 250% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each such
individual, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for any and all costs and expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they
are incurred; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall have made an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 5.9(b)_), judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any Action
(whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or
with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party
or as a participant other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an
" _Indemnified Party Proceeding_ ") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Partys
being or having been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise in connection with any
action taken or not taken at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Partys service in
connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she
serves or has served as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary at the request of the

 



54  Company (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit
plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues
in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or
threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x)
each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the
Company and any Indemnified Party and set forth in Section 5.9(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter; and (y) any indemnification provision
(including advancement of expenses, subject to the undertaking in this
Section 5.9 to repay advanced amounts) and any exculpation provision set forth
in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, in
each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Parent shall
pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred
by Indemnified Parties in connection with their enforcement of their rights
provided under this  _Section 5.9_. Parents and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_
,  _however_ , that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.9_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that from and after the Effective
Time the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_).

SECTION 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. The Company shall be permitted to take such steps
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Offer, the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b3 under the Exchange Act.

 



55 SECTION 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one

practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
analogous public statement with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release or make any other analogous public statement prior to such
consultation and without considering carefully and in good faith all comments
timely received from the other party, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or rule or regulation of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or the
New York Stock Exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the

Purchaser before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change effected
in accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_, and (b) Parent shall not be required to
consult with the Company before issuing any press release or making any other
public statement in connection with the issuance by the Company of any

actions to cause (a) the repayment in full on the Closing Date of all
obligations then outstanding under, (b) the release on the Closing Date in
connection with such repayment of (1) all guarantees of such obligations
under and (2) all Liens securing such obligations (including any guarantee
thereof) under, and (c) the termination on the Closing Date of, the Term Loan
Facility (such actions described in clauses (a) through (c), the " _Term Loan
Facility Terminations_ "), including by obtaining a payoff letter in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent from the Collateral Agent under the
Term Loan Facility; provided, that in no event shall this Section 5.13
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) cause any of the Term
Loan Facility Terminations to be effective until the Closing shall have
occurred; or (ii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
liability in connection with the Term Loan Facility Terminations that is

the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 5.15 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable

the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, will approve, as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each
agreement, arrangement or understanding between Purchaser, the Company or
their respective Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company that are effective as of the date of this Agreement or are
entered into after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time pursuant to which compensation is paid to such officer,
director or employee and will take all other action reasonably necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 5.18 _Transaction Expenses_. Assuming the Offer Acceptance Time occurs
on or before December 31, 2017 (the " _Measurement Date_ "), the Company will
have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to pay and fully discharge
all outstanding Transaction Expenses and Indebtedness on or prior to the
Closing. In the event the Offer Acceptance Time occurs on or before the
Measurement Date and the Companys cash and cash equivalents are insufficient
to pay and fully discharge such Transaction Expenses and Indebtedness on or
prior to Closing (the " _Closing Shortfall_ "), there shall be no adjustment
to the aggregate Offer Price or Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the CVR Agreement if such Closing Shortfall does not exceed
$250,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "). In the event the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs on or before the Measurement Date and the Closing Shortfall exceeds the
Threshold Amount, the first occurring Milestone Payment (as defined in the CVR
Agreement), if any, payable in accordance with the terms of the CVR Agreement
shall be reduced by the full amount of the Closing Shortfall. In the event the
Offer Acceptance Time occurs after the Measurement Date, promptly following
the Measurement Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of its
aggregate balance of cash and cash equivalents as of the Measurement Date ("
_Measurement Date Cash Balance_ ") and the aggregate amount of Transaction
Expenses and Indebtedness due and payable as if the Closing were to occur on
the Measurement Date (the " _Measurement Date Transaction Expenses_ ") and,
to the extent the Measurement Date Transaction Expenses exceed the Measurement
Date Cash Balance by more than the Threshold Amount (the " _Measurement

accordance with the terms of the CVR Agreement shall be reduced by the full
amount of the Measurement Date Shortfall.

 

SECTION 5.19 _Approval by Sole Stockholder_. Immediately after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Purchaser, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and in accordance with the DGCL.

(i) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if Parent or Purchaser has
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or
Purchaser is untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate, (A) if occurring or continuing at the Offer
Acceptance Time would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser
from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B)
cannot be cured on or prior to the fifth Business Day immediately before the
Outside Date or, to the extent so curable, has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after receiving such written notice thereof from the Company (or, if

_provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (i) if there has been a violation or

(d) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company:

 

(i) at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if the Company has

Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement
delivered in connection herewith. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the failure
of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Offer at the time required by
_Section 1.1(i)_ after all the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived
or the Merger on the date required by Section 2.2 after the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing and which are capable of being satisfied on the
Closing Date, assuming for purposes hereof that the date of termination is
the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived shall constitute a Willful
Breach by Parent and Purchaser, and Parent shall be liable to the Company for
such breach as provided herein notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this
Agreement, including in the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.2_,
nothing shall relieve any party for its fraud.

 

SECTION 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _Generally_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the CVR
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Offer and Merger are consummated.

 

(b) _Breakup Fee_. In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_;

 



60 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(i)_, by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), or by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) (unless the Company would have at such time been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) but for
such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i)), and (A) an Acquisition
Proposal is made directly to the Companys stockholders or is otherwise
publicly disclosed or communicated to the Company Board before such
termination and (B) within twelve months after the date of such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement in respect of any Acquisition
Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal described in clause
(A) above) (and the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently consummated) ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this clause (B),
each reference to "20% or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%");

then the Company shall pay Parent the Breakup Fee by wire transfer of same-day
U.S. dollars to the applicable account or accounts designated in writing to
the Company by Parent (x) in the case of _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_, within three
Business Days after such termination, (y) in the case of _Section 7.3(b)(i)_,
substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ and (z) in the case of _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_,
substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.
For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section 7.3(b)_ shall be payable only once with respect to _Section 7.3(b)_
and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or
more provisions hereof. In the event that Parent shall receive full payment
pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_, the receipt of the Breakup Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, the Company shall have
no further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law or in equity, to
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for
damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement (other than equitable relief to require payment of the Breakup Fee),
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming
the basis for such termination; _provided_ , that (A) nothing in this _Section
7.3(b)_ shall relieve the Company from any liabilities or damages resulting
from any fraud or Willful Breach committed by the Company prior to such
termination and (B) if the Company fails to pay the Breakup Fee in accordance
with this _Section 7.3(b) _and Parent and/or Purchaser commences a suit which
results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for the
Breakup Fee or any portion thereof, then the Company shall pay Parent and
Purchaser their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Breakup Fee from and including the date payment of such amount was due through
the date of payment, at the "prime rate" as published

 



61  in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made plus two percent (2%) (calculated daily on the
basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding). The Breakup Fee is non-refundable and shall not be offset by or
credited against any other payment. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent or Purchaser would enter into this
Agreement.

under this Agreement. As a material inducement to the Companys willingness to
enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Guarantor
hereby unconditionally guarantees (the " _Guarantee_ ") full performance and
payment by each of Parent and Purchaser of each of the covenants, obligations
and undertakings required to be performed by Parent and Purchaser under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to all
terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby
represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such
representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such
covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Parent or Purchaser shall
also be deemed to be a breach or default of Guarantor, and the Company shall
have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all
available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against any or all of Guarantor, Parent and Purchaser
in the first instance. The Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and
performance, and not of collection. As applicable, references in this
_Section 8.16_ to "Purchaser" shall also include the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time.

 

(b) Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company that (i) Guarantor is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to execute and deliver the Guarantee and to
perform its obligations hereunder, (iii) the execution, delivery
and performance of the Guarantee by Guarantor have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate or similar action on the part of Guarantor, and no
other corporate or similar proceedings on the part of Guarantor are necessary
to approve the Guarantee and (iv) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein and the compliance with the provisions herein will not, conflict with
or violate any applicable Law or agreement binding upon Guarantor, nor
require authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity, except in each case as would not impact Guarantors
ability to perform or comply with its obligations hereunder in any
material respect. None of Guarantor, Parent or Purchaser, nor any of their
Affiliates, nor any Representative of any of the foregoing, is making any
representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, written or oral,
express or implied, in connection with Guarantor or the Guarantee, except as
expressly set forth in this _Section 8.16_, and such Persons hereby expressly
disclaim any such other representations or warranties.

 

(c) The provisions of _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Article VIII_ will be deemed to
be applicable to this _Section 8.16_, and for the purposes of such
provisions, Guarantor shall be considered a "party."

[SIGNATURE PAGE TO MERGER AGREEMENT] _ANNEX I_

 

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

 

Capitalized terms used in this Annex I but not defined herein have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Agreement_ ") of which this Annex I is a part.

The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses (a) through (g) below.
Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for
payment or (subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act) pay for, and may delay the
acceptance for payment of, or (subject to any such rules and regulations) the
payment for, any tendered Shares, and, to the extent permitted by the
Agreement, may terminate the Offer: (i) upon termination of the Agreement; and
(ii) at any scheduled Expiration Date (subject to any extensions of the Offer
pursuant to Section 1.1(c) of the Agreement), if: (A) the Minimum Condition,
the Termination Condition and the condition set forth in clause (f) shall not
be satisfied by one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Expiration
Date; or (B) any of the additional conditions set forth below shall not be
satisfied or waived in writing by Parent:

 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Shares
that, considered together with all other Shares (if any) beneficially owned
by Parent and its Affiliates, represent one more Share than 50% of the sum of
(x) the total number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of
the Offer, plus (y) the total number of Shares that the Company would be
required to issue upon conversion, settlement, exchange or exercise of all
options, warrants, rights and securities (other than Cancelled Company Stock
Options and Cancelled Company Warrants) outstanding at the time of the
expiration of the Offer that are then convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable into Shares (whether then outstanding or for which the conversion,
settlement, exchange or exercise date has already occurred, but in any event
without duplication) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); provided, however, that
for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied,
the parties shall exclude Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term is
defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL);

(b) (i) each of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Sections 3.4(a)_ , _3.4(b)_ , _3.4(c)_ , _3.4(d)_ and _3.4(e)_ of the
Agreement shall, except for any _de minimis_ inaccuracies, be true and correct
as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Offer Acceptance Time as if
made as of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), (ii) each of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in clause (i) of _Section 3.1(a)_ and
Sections _3.1(b)_ , _3.2_ , _3.16_ and _3.17_ of the Agreement shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Agreement and as
of the Offer Acceptance Time as if made as of the Offer Acceptance Time
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), and (iii) each of
the remaining representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article III_ of the  Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and as
of the Offer Acceptance Time as if made as of the Offer Acceptance Time
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except for any
inaccuracies of such representations and warranties the circumstances giving
rise to which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (provided, that for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties in
this clause (iii), all materiality and Material Adverse Effect qualifications
and exceptions contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded);

(c) the Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time;

(d) since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any event,
change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(e) Parent shall have received a certificate signed by an executive officer of
the Company certifying as to the matters set forth in clauses (b) through (d)
above;

(f) no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other judgment, order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction
located in the United States or in another jurisdiction outside of the United
States in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, engage in material business operations, shall be in effect,
and no Law shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed
applicable by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction located in the
United States or in another jurisdiction outside of the United States in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, engage in material business operations, that, in any case,
enjoins, prohibits or makes illegal the acquisition of or payment for Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger; and

(g) the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms
(the " _Termination Condition_ ").

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of,
the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (including
any action or inaction by Parent or Purchaser) and (except for the Minimum
Condition) may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent and
Purchaser. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

Entity, less the Permitted Deductions, in each case as determined in
accordance with the Accounting Standards, including the accounting methods
for translating activity denominated in foreign currencies into United States
dollar amounts, as historically and consistently applied by the Company and
its Affiliates, and consistent with the audited net sales reported externally
by Guarantor in its SEC filings. Non-commercial sales or other dispositions of
the Product (i.e., sales that occur in a jurisdiction before approval, by the
FDA or other applicable Regulatory Authority to commercialize the Product in
that jurisdiction), so long as no monetary consideration is received by the
applicable Selling Entity, shall not be deemed to be "Product sold" for
purposes of calculating Product Sales. In the case of any sale of the Product
between or among any of the Selling Entities for resale, Product Sales shall
be calculated as above only on the value charged or invoiced on the first bona
fide arms-length sale thereafter to a third party; provided, however that,
where the purchasing Selling Entity is an end-user of, and does not further
sell, the Product, Product Sales shall be calculated on the value charged or
invoiced to such purchasing Selling Entity, less the Permitted Deductions, in
each case as determined in accordance with the Accounting Standards,
including the accounting methods for translating activity denominated in
foreign currencies into United States dollar amounts, as historically and
consistently applied by the Company and its Affiliates, and consistent with
the audited net sales reported externally by Guarantor in its SEC filings. If
any Selling Entity receives any consideration other than monies for the sale
of the Product, Product Sales shall include the fair market value of such
consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be
included in Product Sales: (a) Product provided for testing, administration to
patients enrolled in clinical trials or for other research purposes or (b)
Product used for test marketing, promotional or sampling purposes, _provided_
that, in each case of (a) or (b), to the extent the relevant Selling Entity is
reimbursed by a third-party payor for any of the foregoing,
such reimbursements will be included in Product Sales.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Product is sold as a
Combination Product (a " _Combination Sale_ "), the Product Sales amount for
the Product sold in such a Combination Sale shall be determined as follows:



     | (i) | Except as provided below, the Product Sales amount for a
Combination Sale in a particular country shall be calculated by multiplying
the gross amount invoiced for the Combination Sale (" _Gross Combination

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

 

SECTION 2.1 _CVRs; Holders of CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders
to receive contingent cash payments pursuant to this CVR Agreement. The
initial Holders shall be the (a) holders of Shares (other than (i) Excluded
Shares and (ii) any Dissenting Shares), (b) holders of RSUs, (c) holders of In
the Money Company Stock Options and (d) holders of Company Warrants (but
excluding any Company Warrants cancelled in accordance with Section 2.9(b)(ii)
of the Merger Agreement), in each case, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or the Offer Acceptance Time in the case of Shares validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 



7 SECTION 2.2 _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. Any
attempted transfer, in whole or in part, that is not a Permitted Transfer,
will be void _ab initio_ and of no effect.

 

SECTION 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address_.

 

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
registration of CVRs in a book-entry position for each Holder. The CVR
Register shall set forth the name and address of each Holder, the number of
CVRs held by such Holder, and the U.S. federal tax identification number of
each Holder. The Company may receive and inspect a copy of the CVR Register,
from time to time, upon written request made to the CVR Registrar. Within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of such request, the CVR Registrar shall
deliver a copy of the CVR Register, as then in effect, to the Company at the
address set forth in  _SECTION 7.2_. The Rights Agent is hereby initially
appointed "CVR Registrar" for the purpose of registering CVRs and transfers of
CVRs as herein provided.

 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in _SECTION
2.2_, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its customary policies
and guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the Holders attorney
duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal representative or the
Holders survivor, and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances
relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer
instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the
other terms and conditions of this CVR Agreement (including the provisions
of  _SECTION 2.2_), register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register.
Any transfer of CVRs will be without charge (other than the cost of any Tax)
to the applicable Holder. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to
take any action under any section of this CVR Agreement that requires the
payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable Taxes or charges unless and until
the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have been paid.
All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid
obligations of the Company and shall entitle the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this CVR Agreement as those held immediately prior
to the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR shall be valid until
registered in the CVR Register.

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change
such Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must
be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the
Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the written
notice is in proper form, promptly record the change of address in the CVR
Register.

SECTION 2.4 _Payment Terms_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall not be permitted to
issue any CVRs that have the right to receive any portion of the Milestone
Payments, except as provided in, and in accordance with the terms and

(A) deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate of the Company certifying (i)
the date of the achievement of the corresponding Milestone and (ii) the

of business in New York City, three (3) Business Days prior to the Record
Date, of CVRs received with respect to the RSUs or the In the Money Company
Stock Options, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Applicable Per Share
Milestone Payment multiplied by (ii) the number of CVRs held by each such
Holder as of the Record Date; and

(C) pay to the Rights Agent, by wire transfer to the account designated by
the Rights Agent at least five (5) Business Days prior to such Milestone
Payment Date, the aggregate amount to be paid by the Rights Agent to holders
of CVRs received with respect to Shares and Company Warrants pursuant to
_SECTION 2.4(b)(ii)_ ; and

(ii) the Rights Agent shall promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) pay to each Holder of record, as of the close of business in
New York City, three (3) Business Days prior to the Milestone Payment Date
(the " _Record Date_ "), of CVRs received with respect to the Shares or
Company Warrants, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Applicable Per
Share Milestone Payment multiplied by (ii) the number of CVRs held by each
such Holder as of the Record Date.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to
pay any Milestone Payment more than once.

 

(c) No interest or dividends shall accrue on any amounts payable in respect of
the CVRs.

 

(d) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the Parties agree
to treat the Milestone Payments from the CVRs received with respect to the
Shares and the Company Warrants, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, as
additional consideration for the Shares and the Company Warrants for all
U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes and none of
the Parties will take any position to the contrary on any U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax Return or for other U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes except as required by
applicable Law.

(e) The Parties agree, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, to
treat the Milestone Payments from the CVRs received with respect to the RSUs
and Company Stock Options, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, as
compensation for all U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes (and not to treat the receipt of a CVR as a compensation payment
itself).

(f) Except as provided in this CVR Agreement, none of the Company or any of
its Affiliates shall have any right to set off any amounts owed or claimed to
be owed by any Holder to any of them against such Holders Milestone Payment
or other amount payable to such Holder in respect of the CVRs.

 



9 SECTION 2.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, the Company and the Rights Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable under the terms of this CVR
Agreement such amounts as the Company or the Rights Agent are required to
deduct and withhold pursuant to any provision of Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this CVR Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

SECTION 2.6 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership
Interest_.

 

(a) CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will not

in any constituent party to the Merger Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates.

SECTION 2.7 _Enforcement of Rights of Holders_. Any actions seeking the
enforcement of the rights of Holders hereunder may be brought either by the
Rights Agent or the Acting Holders.

SECTION 2.8 _Ability to Abandon CVRs_. A Holder may at any time, at
such Holders option, abandon all of such Holders remaining rights in a CVR
by transferring such CVR to the Company without consideration therefor.
Nothing in this CVR Agreement shall prohibit the Company or any of its
Affiliates from offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration
from the Holders, in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole
discretion. Any CVRs acquired by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be
automatically deemed extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of
the definitions of Acting Holders, _ARTICLE 5_ and _SECTIONS_ _2.7_ and _4.3_
hereunder; provided; however, such abandoned CVRs or CVRs acquired by the
Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed outstanding as of the
applicable Record Date for purposes of calculating the Applicable Per Share
Milestone Payment and no payment shall be made with respect to such abandoned
or acquired CVRs.

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders delivered to the Company
not less than thirty (30) days in advance (but no more than once during any

and during normal business hours to such of the records of the Company, as may

directly related to their findings and shall disclose whether it
has determined that any statements set forth in the Product Sales Statements
are incorrect. The Independent Accountant shall provide the Company with a

the Acting Holders as contemplated by this _SECTION 4.3_ shall not relieve the
Company of its obligation to pay the Product Sales Milestone Payment relating
to the Product Sales Milestone for which notice of achievement has been given
in a Product Sales Statement, it being understood that the Company shall also
be obligated to pay the full amount of the CVR Shortfall, if any, determined
in accordance with SECTION 4.3(b).

(b) No later than thirty (30) days following initial access to such records
of the Company as are described _SECTION 4.3(a)_ , the Independent Accountant
shall deliver a written report to the Company and the Acting Holders of its
preliminary findings regarding Product Sales and any potentially applicable
Product Sales Milestone Payments (the " _Preliminary Shortfall Report_ ").
The Company and the Acting Holders shall have thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Preliminary Shortfall Report from the Independent Accountant
(the " _Preliminary Shortfall Report Review Period_ ") to review and comment
upon the Preliminary Shortfall Report. The Independent Accountant shall take
into consideration in good faith any comments received from the Company or the
Acting Holders during the Preliminary Shortfall Report Review Period. No
later than ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the Preliminary
Shortfall Report Review Period, the Independent Accountant shall deliver a
final written report to the Company and the Acting Holders (the " _Final
Shortfall Report_ "). If the Independent Accountant in the Final Shortfall
Report concludes that the Product Sales Milestone Payment should have been
paid but was not paid when due, then no later than sixty (60) days following
its receipt of the Final Shortfall Report, the Company shall deliver to the
Rights Agent the amount of such Product Sales Milestone Payment plus interest
on such Product Sales Milestone Payment at the Shortfall Interest Rate from
the date the Product Sales Milestone Payment Date should have occurred to the
date of actual payment (to the extent not paid on a subsequent date) (such
amount, including interest, being the " _CVR Shortfall_ "). The Rights Agent
shall pay the CVR Shortfall to the CVR Holders of record as of a date that is
three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which the Product Sales Milestone
Payment is made to the Rights Agent. The Final Shortfall Report shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Company and the Holders, shall be non-
appealable and shall not be subject to further review, absent manifest error.

 

(c) Each Person seeking to receive information from the Company in connection
with a review or audit shall enter into, and shall cause its accounting firm

agreement with the Company obligating such party to retain all such financial
information disclosed to such party in confidence pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement and not use such information for any purpose other

commercialize the Product. Without limiting the foregoing, so long as any of
the CVRs remain outstanding, in the event that the Company or, after a
transaction permitted and undertaken pursuant to this _SECTION 4.4_, any of
its respective successors, assignees or transferees: (a) consolidates or
merges with or into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger; or (b) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its

 



14  properties and assets to any Person or otherwise transfers or conveys the
Compound or Product (any such consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance, a
" _Product Transfer_ "), then, and in each such case, the Company shall
either (i) ensure that each such successor, assignee or transferee of the
Company or such assets, Compound or Product agrees to assume all obligations
of the Company, including payment of all Milestone Payments, set forth in
this CVR Agreement or (ii) the Company shall agree to remain subject to its
obligations hereunder, including payment of all Milestone Payments. Further,
in the event of an assignment by the Company to any controlled Affiliate of
the Company, but only for so long as it remains a controlled Affiliate of the

this ARTICLE 5, the Rights Agent shall be entitled to receive, and shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an opinion of counsel for the Company or any
of its Affiliates stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized

SECTION 6.1 _Successor Person Substituted_.

 

(a) All covenants, provisions and agreements in this CVR Agreement by or for

ARTICLE 7

MISCELLANEOUS 

SECTION 7.1 _Notices_.

(a) Where this CVR Agreement provides for notice to Holders of any event,
such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder affected by such event, at the Holders address as it appears in the
CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where
notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice,
nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect
the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this CVR
Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in
writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after
the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by Holders shall be filed with the Rights Agent, but such filing shall
not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance
upon such waiver.

(b) In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason
of any other cause, it shall be impracticable to mail notice of any event as
required by any provision of this CVR Agreement, then any method of giving
such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Rights Agent shall be deemed to
be a sufficient giving of such notice.

SECTION 7.2 _Notices to the Rights Agent and the Company_. All notices,
requests, instructions, demands, waivers and other communications or
documents required or permitted to be given under this CVR Agreement by any
party hereto to any other party hereto shall be in writing and delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by
facsimile, electronic mail or overnight courier to such party, in the case of
mail, facsimile or overnight courier, with a copy sent via electronic mail, at

constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter of this CVR Agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter of this CVR Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.11 _Termination_. This CVR Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect, and the parties hereto shall have no
liability hereunder, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Termination
Date, _provided_ that if any Milestone has been achieved on or prior to the
Termination Date, but the associated Milestone Payment has not been paid on or
prior to the Termination Date, this CVR Agreement shall not terminate to the
extent related to such Milestone Payment until such Milestone Payment has been
paid in full in accordance with the terms of this CVR Agreement; and
_provided_ _further_ that no termination of this CVR Agreement shall be
deemed to affect the rights of the parties to bring suit in the case of a
material breach occurring prior to such Termination Date.

 

SECTION 7.12 _Guarantee_.

(a) Guarantor shall cause the Company to comply in all respects with each of
the covenants, obligations and undertakings made or required to be performed
by the Company under this Agreement and the other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. As a material inducement to Oceras willingness to enter into
the Merger Agreement and perform its obligations thereunder, Guarantor hereby
unconditionally guarantees (the " _Guarantee_ ") full performance and payment
by the Company of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings
required to be performed by the Company under this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions
and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents,
acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such representation and
warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation,
agreement or undertaking of the Company shall also be deemed to be a breach
or default of Guarantor, and the Acting Holders shall have the right,
exercisable in their sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies
they may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly
against any or all of Guarantor and the Company in the first instance. The
Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collection.

(b) Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company that (i) Guarantor is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to execute and deliver the Guarantee and to
perform its obligations hereunder, (iii) the execution, delivery and
performance of the Guarantee by Guarantor have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or similar action on the part of Guarantor, and no other
corporate or similar proceedings on the part of Guarantor are necessary to
approve the Guarantee and (iv) the execution and delivery of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
the compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with or violate
any applicable Law or agreement binding upon Guarantor, nor require any
authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity, except in each case for filings with the SEC by
Guarantor or as would not impact the Companys or Guarantors ability to
perform or comply with its obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect. None of Guarantor, the Company, nor any of their Affiliates, nor

 



20  any Representative of any of the foregoing, is making any representation or
warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, written or oral, express or
implied, in connection with Guarantor or the Guarantee, except as expressly
set forth in this _SECTION 7.12_ , and such Persons hereby expressly disclaim
any such other representations or warranties.
