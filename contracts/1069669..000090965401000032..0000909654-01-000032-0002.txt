lien  arising under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code, 
neither Virginia Capital nor any Virginia Capital Subsidiary has been 
required to post any security pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA or Section 
401(a)(29) of the Code, and there are no facts which could be expected to 
give rise to such lien or such posting of security. No event has occurred 
and no condition exists that would subject Virginia Capital or any  Virginia
Capital Subsidiary to any tax under Sections 4971, 4972, 4976,  4977 or 4979

a member during such five-year period.   (vii) As of December 31, 1999, the
fair market value of the assets  of each Plan that is a tax qualified defined
benefit plan equaled or  exceeded, and as of the Closing Date will equal or

Neither the consideration nor implementation of the  transactions
contemplated under this Agreement will increase (A) Virginia  Capital\'s or
any Virginia Capital Subsidiary\'s obligation to make  contributions or any
other payments to fund benefits accrued under the  Plans as of the date of
this Agreement or (B) the benefits accrued or  payable with respect to any
participant under the Plans (except to the  extent benefits may be deemed

Effective Time.  5.11 Affiliates  ----------   Virginia Capital shall use
its best efforts to cause all persons who are Affiliates of Virginia Capital

Plan Determination Date with respect to the 401(k) plan of Virginia Capital,
BBandT; shall cause such plan to be merged with the 401(k) plan maintained by
BBandT; and the BBandT; Subsidiaries, or to be frozen or terminated, in each case

the Effective Time who (i) is a participant in the 401(k) plan of Virginia
Capital, (ii) becomes an employee immediately following the Effective Time of
BBandT; or of any   37   41   subsidiary of BBandT; ("Employer Entity"),
and (iii) continues in the employment of an Employer Entity until the Benefit
Plan Determination Date for the 401(k) plan, shall be eligible to participate
in BBandT;\'s 401(k) plan as of such Benefit Plan Determination Date. Any other
former employee of Virginia Capital who is employed by an Employer Entity on
or after such Benefit Plan Determination Date shall be eligible to be a
participant in the BBandT; 401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility
requirements. All rights to participate in BBandT;\'s 401(k) plan are subject
to BBandT;\'s right to amend or terminate the plan. Until such Benefit Plan
Determination Date, BBandT; shall continue in effect for the benefit
of participating employees the 401(k) plan of Virginia Capital. For purposes
of administering BBandT;\'s 401(k) plan, service with Virginia Capital and the
Virginia Capital Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with BBandT; for
participation and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit accrual.
Each employee of Virginia Capital or a Virginia Capital Subsidiary at the
Effective Time who becomes an employee immediately following the Effective
Time of an Employer Entity is referred to herein as a "Transferred
Employee."   (b) Each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate
in group hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability and other welfare
benefit plans and programs available to employees of the Employer Entity,
subject to the terms of such plans and programs, as of the Benefit Plan
Determination Date for each such plan or program, conditional upon the
Transferred Employee\'s being employed by an Employer Entity as of such
Benefit Plan Determination Date and subject to complying with eligibility
requirements of the respective plans and programs. With respect to health
care coverages, participation in BBandT;\'s plans may be subject to
availability of HMO options. In any case in which HMO coverage is not
available, substitute coverage will be provided that may not be
fully comparable to the HMO coverage. With respect to any welfare benefit
plan or program of Virginia Capital that the Employer Entity determines, in
its sole discretion, provides benefits of the same type or class as a
corresponding plan or program maintained by the Employer Entity, the Employer
Entity shall continue such Virginia Capital plan or program in effect for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees so long as they remain eligible to
participate and until they shall become eligible to become participants in
the corresponding plan or program maintained by the Employer Entity (and,
with respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying with
eligibility requirements and subject to the right of the Employer Entity to
terminate such plan or program). For purposes of administering the welfare
plans and programs subject to this Section 5.12(b), (A) service with Virginia
Capital shall be deemed to be service with the Employer Entity for the
purpose of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (if applicable)
in such welfare plans and programs, but not for the purpose of computing
benefits, if any, determined in whole or in part with reference to service
(except as otherwise provided in Section 5.12(c)), and (B) each Transferred
Employee shall receive credit for any deductibles and out-of pocket expenses
paid prior to the applicable Benefit Plan Determination Date (to the same
extent such credit was given under the analogous plan prior to such Benefit
Plan Determination Date) in satisfying any applicable deductibles or out-of-
pocket expenses.   38   42     (c) Except to the extent of commitments
herein or other contractual commitments, if any, specifically made or assumed
hereunder by BBandT;, neither BBandT; nor any Employer Entity shall have any
obligation arising from the Merger to continue any Transferred Employees in
its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any Transferred Employee
any specified level of compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or
perquisites. Each Transferred Employee who is terminated by an Employer
Entity subsequent to the Effective Time shall be entitled to severance pay in
accordance with the general severance policy maintained by BBandT;, if and to
the extent that such employee is entitled to severance pay under such policy.
Such employee\'s service with Virginia Capital or a Virginia Capital
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with BBandT; for purposes of determining
the amount of severance pay, if any, under BBandT;\'s severance policy.   (d)
BBandT; agrees to honor all employment agreements, severance agreements and
deferred compensation agreements that Virginia Capital and the
Virginia Capital Subsidiaries have with their current and former employees
and directors and which have been Disclosed to BBandT; pursuant to this
Agreement, except to the extent any such agreements shall be superseded or
terminated at the Closing or following the Closing Date. Except for the
agreements described in the preceding sentence and except as otherwise
provided in this Section 5.12, the employee benefit plans of Virginia Capital
shall, in the sole discretion of BBandT;, be frozen, terminated or merged into
comparable plans of BBandT;, effective as BBandT; shall determine in its sole
discretion.   (e) Notwithstanding and without limiting the generality of
Section 5.12(d), as soon as practicable following the date hereof but, in any
event, prior to the Effective Time, Virginia Capital shall take any and all
action necessary to terminate the ESOP as of the Effective Time, to repay
any outstanding indebtedness thereof and to allocate shares of Virginia
Capital Common Stock held thereby to the participants therein in accordance
with the terms thereof. No purchases of shares of Virginia Capital Common
Stock shall be made thereunder after the date hereof.  5.13 Directors and
Officers Protection  ---------------------------------   BBandT; or a BBandT;
Subsidiary shall provide and keep in force for a period of three years after
the Effective Time directors\' and officers\' liability insurance providing
coverage to directors and officers of Virginia Capital for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance shall provide at least
the same coverage and amounts as contained in Virginia Capital\'s policy on
the date hereof; provided, that in no event shall the annual premium on such
policy exceed 150% of the annual premium payments on Virginia Capital\'s
policy in effect as of the date hereof (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount
of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, BBandT; shall use its reasonable efforts
to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, BBandT; further agrees to indemnify all
individuals who are or have been   39   43    officers, directors or
employees of Virginia Capital or any Virginia Capital Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time from any acts or omissions in such capacities prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent that such indemnification is provided pursuant
to the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Virginia Capital on the date
hereof and is permitted under the VSCA and the NCBCA. BBandT; shall also
advance indemnifiable expenses as incurred to the extent permitted by the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Virginia Capital on the date
hereof and permitted under the VSCA and the NCBCA.  5.14 Forbearances of
BBandT;  --------------------   Except with the prior written consent of
Virginia Capital, between the date hereof and the Effective Time neither
BBandT; nor any BBandT; Subsidiary shall take any action which would or might be

inaccuracy of a representation or warranty herein that would allow for
termination of this Agreement; (iii) cause any of the conditions precedent to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to fail to be satisfied; or

ordinances or governmental actions applicable to it and to the conduct of its

the Effective Time, all reports required to be filed by it with the
Commission and any other regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over such
party, and shall deliver to BBandT; or Virginia Capital, as the case may be,
copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. If financial
statements are contained in any such reports filed with the Commission, such
financial statements will fairly present the consolidated financial position
of the entity filing such statements as of the dates indicated and the
consolidated results of operations, changes in shareholders\' equity, and
cash flows for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the
case of interim financial statements to the absence of notes and to normal
recurring year-end adjustments that are not material). As of their respective
dates, such reports filed with the Commission will comply in all material
respects with the Securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any
financial statements contained in any other reports to a regulatory authority
other than the Commission shall be prepared in accordance with requirements
applicable to such reports.  5.16 Exchange Listing  ----------------

period, Advisory Board Members, if they continue to serve in such capacity,
shall receive fees in accordance with BBandT;\'s standard schedule of fees for
service thereon as in effect from time to time. For two years after the
Effective Time, no such Advisory Board member shall be prohibited from
serving thereon because he or she shall have attained the maximum age for
service thereon (currently age 70). Membership of any person on any Advisory
Board shall be conditional upon execution of an agreement providing that such
person will not engage in activities competitive with BBandT; for two years
following the Effective Time or, if longer, the period that he or she is a
member of the Advisory Board.  5.18 Special Payments and Distributions

distributions or payments to Samuel C. Harding, Jr. or Peggy J. Newman or
