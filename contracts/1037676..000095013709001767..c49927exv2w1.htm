 2.2 _Closing_. Closing shall occur as promptly as possible and in any event (a) not later than five (5) Business Days following the later of the date that Seller has notified Buyer of the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions precedent to Sellers obligations set forth in _Article VI_ or that Buyer has notified Seller of the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions precedent to Buyers obligations set forth in _Article VI_; or (b) on such other date as Buyer and Seller may agree (the "Closing Date"). Closing shall take place at the Greenwood Village, Colorado offices of Holland and Hart LLP, attorneys for Seller, or at such other place as Buyer and Seller may agree not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and shall be effective as of 11:59:59 p.m., Mountain Time on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time"). 

  

 (a) In consideration for the sale of the Equity Interests, at Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds to a bank account (or accounts) designated by Seller not later than two (2) Business Days prior to Closing Date: 

   

 (i) Seven Hundred Sixty-One Million Dollars (US$761,000,000) (the "Unadjusted Purchase Price");

(which Unadjusted Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be the "Closing Date

 (b) On the Closing Date and simultaneously with Closing, to the extent any such amounts are not either: (x) included in the Closing Date Purchase Price as an Estimated Indebtedness Payment or (y) paid, assumed or retained by Seller (or any of its Affiliates other than the Companies) and thus remain after the Closing as the sole obligations or liabilities of either of the Companies on the Closing Date, and only to the extent not included in _Section 2.2(a)(iv)_ above, then Seller shall make or cause to be made the following payments (which, solely to the extent any such payment is to be made by one of the Companies, are referred to herein as "Estimated Closing Date Payments":

 2.3 _Undisclosed Encumbrances._  

  

 (a) For a period of forty-five (45) calendar days following the Effective Date (the "Evaluation Period"), Buyer and its Affiliates, including its and their Representatives, shall have the right to conduct such investigation concerning Sellers and/or the Companies ownership interests in and to the Mineral and/or Real Properties within the boundaries of the Coal Leases as it determines reasonably necessary. If, during the Evaluation Period, Buyer identifies any Encumbrances (i) of the nature described in clauses (i) (unless otherwise addressed in _Section 5.14_ ) or (ii) of the definition of "Permitted Encumbrances" or (ii) of the nature described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of the definition of "Permitted Encumbrances" to which Seller or either Company or any of its or their Affiliates is a party and arising after July 23, 1998, and, in either case (i) or (ii) above, which are not identified on _Section 1.1(vvvv)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Undisclosed Encumbrances") on the Effective Date, then Buyer shall deliver a Notice (the "Undisclosed Encumbrance Notice") to Seller on or prior to the end of the Evaluation Period of the identity of all such Undisclosed Encumbrances, which Undisclosed Encumbrance Notice shall include a good faith estimate, determined in accordance with generally accepted business practices in the coal mining industry in the Powder River Basin (the "Standards") of the net present value of any Liabilities arising as a result of each such Undisclosed Encumbrance (the "Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Value"), subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 2.3(e)_. If Seller disagrees with any Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Value included in the Undisclosed 

    ##### 

  

    

Encumbrance Notice, it shall, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of
the Undisclosed Encumbrance Notice, deliver a Notice to Buyer (the
"Encumbrance Disagreement Notice"), setting forth its calculation of the
estimate of the net present value of the Liabilities arising as a result of
the applicable Undisclosed Encumbrance, also determined in accordance with the
Standards, and specifying, in reasonable detail, Buyers calculation of each
Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Value contained in the Undisclosed
Encumbrance Notice with respect to which Seller disagrees and the reasons for
such disagreement. Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all
Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values contained in the Undisclosed
Encumbrance Notice other than those specified in a timely Encumbrance
Disagreement Notice. If Seller does not deliver an Encumbrance Disagreement
Notice to Buyer within such ten (10) Business Day period, Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted the schedule of Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance
Values contained in the Undisclosed Encumbrance Notice, whereupon Buyers
calculation of the Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values shall become
final and binding. 

   

 (b) If Seller timely delivers an Encumbrance Disagreement Notice to Buyer, the Parties shall use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values included in the Encumbrance Disagreement Notice within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the Encumbrance Disagreement Notice; provided, however, in no event shall the agreed upon amounts be more favorable to Buyer than reflected in Buyers calculation of the Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values included in the Undisclosed Encumbrance Notice, nor more favorable to Seller than shown in the calculations delivered by Seller pursuant to the Encumbrance Disagreement Notice. In the event the Parties are able to reach agreement, the net present value of any Liabilities arising as a result of any Undisclosed Encumbrance agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall become final and binding. 

   

 (c) If the Parties do not resolve all Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values included in the Encumbrance Disagreement Notice within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the Encumbrance Disagreement Notice, this Agreement and the remaining disputed Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values will be submitted to Randall T. Cox, P.C., or another nationally recognized mining engineering firm in the United States mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the "Engineering Referee"), for determination. Each Party shall then have five (5) calendar days to submit its prepared valuation of the remaining disputed Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values to the Engineering Referee, along with any supporting documentation and data used in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Engineering Referee to make its determination of the remaining disputed Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values in accordance with the Standards. The fees and expenses of the Engineering Referee shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. The written report of the Engineering Referee (the "Engineer Report") shall be delivered to Seller and Buyer promptly, but in any event no later than the date which is twenty (20) Business Days after such remaining disputed Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values and supporting documentation are submitted to the Engineering Referee, and the findings contained in the Engineer Report shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the Parties, in the absence of fraud. 

   

 (d) The sum of (i) the Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values delivered by Buyer as to which Seller failed to specify in a timely Encumbrance Disagreement Notice pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ , (ii) the Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values contained in a timely Encumbrance Disagreement Notice delivered by Seller as to which Buyer and Seller have agreed pursuant to  _Section 2.3(b)_, and (iii) the Estimated Undisclosed Encumbrance Values determined in the Engineer Report, without duplication, shall constitute the "Final Undisclosed Encumbrance Value" and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the Parties in the absence of fraud, and, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, by the amount thereof, subject to the limitations set forth below in _Section 2.3(e)_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) No adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ : (i) with respect to the Final Undisclosed Encumbrance Value for any individual Undisclosed Encumbrance that is less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$500,000) and (ii) unless the aggregate Final Undisclosed Encumbrance Value for all Undisclosed Encumbrances greater than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$500,000) exceeds One Million Dollars (US$1,000,000). In no event shall the limitations in _Section 8.4_ apply to any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. 

   

 2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within 180 days of the Closing Date (or, if the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3, 2.5, 8.8_, or otherwise, within 180 days of such adjustment), Buyer shall propose to Seller an allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of each Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code for its approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller shall deliver its approval or objections no later than the twentieth (20th) day following receipt of such draft allocation. If Seller delivers objections, Seller and Buyer shall consult and attempt to resolve in good faith any such objection. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree within thirty (30) days, Buyer and Seller shall refer the matter to the Independent Accountants. Buyer and Seller shall equally share the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants and their determination shall be binding on both Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall report and file Tax Returns, including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such allocation and shall take no position inconsistent therewith or contrary thereto as it relates to the Companies and their assets at Closing unless required to do so by Law. Seller shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such documents, forms and other information as Buyer may reasonably request to prepare such allocation. 

  

 2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer Sellers good faith estimates of: 

   

 (i) the Estimated Cash Payment, 

  

 (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness Payment, and 

  

 (iii) the Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment. 

 

The Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment will be accompanied by a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Seller specifying that the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment was prepared in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 2.5_ and _Exhibit E_ and shall include only
those categories of current assets and current liabilities and line
items included in, and be in a form consistent with, the Sample Calculation
of Net Working Capital set forth in _Exhibit E_ and will be based on changes
from the Reference Net Working Capital set forth in _Exhibit E_. Seller
shall deliver supporting documentation and data for the Estimated Closing
Working Capital Adjustment, the Estimated Indebtedness Payment, and the
Estimated Cash Payment. 

   

 (b) _Exhibit E_ to this Agreement sets forth a sample formula and the mechanics and methodology and Minimum Adjustment against which any Purchase Price Adjustment will be made to the Closing Date Purchase Price. As promptly as possible and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller will prepare or cause to be prepared, and will provide to Buyer: 

   

 (i) the Closing Date Balance Sheet which shall be prepared for purposes of showing the actual working capital (calculated in accordance with _Exhibit E_) as of the Effective Time; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) a written statement setting forth its detailed determination of the actual cash, cash equivalents and the cash value of all marketable securities on hand that were held by the Companies as of the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Cash Amount") and the difference between the Estimated Cash Payment and the Preliminary Cash Amount (the "Preliminary Cash Adjustment"); 

  

 (iii) a written statement setting forth its detailed determination of the actual Indebtedness that was owed by the Companies as of the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Indebtedness Amount") and the difference between the Estimated Indebtedness Payment and the Preliminary Indebtedness Amount (the "Preliminary Indebtedness Adjustment"); and 

  

 (iv) a written statement setting forth its detailed determination of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital"), and of the adjustments to the Net Working Capital based on changes to the Net Working Capital between the Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital derived from the Closing Date Balance Sheet, in each case calculated based on the sample formula and general methodology set forth on _Exhibit E_ (the "Preliminary Working Capital Adjustment"). 

 

For purposes of this _Section 2.5_ and _Exhibit E_, the Preliminary Cash
Adjustment, the Preliminary Indebtedness Adjustment and the Preliminary
Working Capital Adjustment, if any, are referred to collectively as the
"Preliminary Adjustments." 

   

 (c) From the Closing Date until the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment (as defined below), Seller and its Affiliates, including its and their Representatives, and the Independent Accountants, shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon no less than one (1) day advance notice to Buyer, to the Companies and their books, records and employees who are responsible for financial matters, in order to assist in preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and in evaluating any Disagreement Notice (as defined below). Buyer shall provide, and shall cause the Companies and Buyers accountants to provide, any assistance reasonably requested by Seller in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the above, Buyer may limit access to the extent it reasonably deems necessary to avoid unreasonable disruption of the business or of the Companies or to comply with Laws. 

   

 (d) In addition to, and not in limitation of, the access rights set forth in _Section 2.5(c)_ , on the Closing Date or on a mutually agreed upon date before or after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall jointly conduct a physical inventory count to verify the quantity of the inventory of the Companies, including all stockpiled coal and spare parts. The physical inventory count shall be conducted pursuant to procedures reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller and in a manner that ensures that the quantity of inventory can be accurately determined as of the Closing Date. The quantity of the inventory of the Companies as determined pursuant to such physical inventory count shall be set forth on a certificate of inventory signed by Buyer and Seller, which certificate of inventory shall be used by Seller in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet. 

   

 (e) If Buyer disagrees with the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or any of the Preliminary Adjustments, it shall, within thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Adjustments, deliver a Notice to Seller (the "Disagreement Notice"), setting forth its calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital and each of the Preliminary Adjustments, and specifying, in reasonable detail, those items or amounts in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or any of the Preliminary Adjustments as to which Buyer disagrees and the reasons for such disagreement. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Adjustments other than those specified in a timely Disagreement Notice. If Buyer does not deliver a Disagreement Notice to Seller within such 30-day period, Buyer shall 

    ##### 

  

    

be deemed to have accepted the Closing Date Balance Sheet and each of the
Preliminary Adjustments, whereupon the Preliminary Cash Amount shall become
the "Final Cash Amount", the Preliminary Indebtedness Amount shall become the
"Final Indebtedness Amount" and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital
shall become the "Closing Date Working Capital". 

   

 (f) If Buyer timely delivers a Disagreement Notice to Seller, the Parties shall use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Closing Date Working Capital, the Final Cash Amount or the Final Indebtedness Amount, which in no event shall be more favorable to Seller than reflected in any of the Preliminary Adjustments, nor more favorable to Buyer than shown in the calculations delivered by Buyer pursuant to the Disagreement Notice. If the Parties do not resolve all disputed items or amounts within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the Disagreement Notice, this Agreement and the disputed items and amounts will be submitted to KPMG LLP, or another nationally recognized public accounting firm in the United States mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the "Independent Accountants"), for determination of the appropriate Final Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.5_. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. The written report of the Independent Accountants (the "Report") shall be delivered to Seller and Buyer promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after such disputed items are submitted to the Independent Accountants, and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the Parties. 

   

 (g) In the absence of fraud, the foregoing procedures for resolution of disputes concerning calculation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Adjustments set forth in  _Sections 2.5(c)_ and _2.5(e)_ shall be final and the exclusive means of calculating and resolving the same. No Party shall challenge or be entitled to bring any Claim pertaining to such calculation or resolution; provided that if a Party fails to make the payment required within the time period set forth in _Section 2.5(h)_, such procedures shall not preclude the Party to whom such payment is owed from bring any necessary action to collect such amount, and the indemnification provisions of _Article VIII_ shall not apply to such matter. 

   

 (h) The "Purchase Price Adjustment" shall equal the sum of the following: 

   

 (i) (A) if the Final Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Cash Amount, the positive amount by which the Final Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Cash Payment; or (B) if the Estimated Cash Amount exceeds the Final Cash Amount, the negative amount by which the Estimated Cash Amount exceeds the Final Cash Amount; and 

  

 (ii) (A) if the Final Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, the negative amount by which the Final Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness Payment; or (B) if the Estimated Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Final Indebtedness Amount, the positive amount by which the Estimated Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Final Indebtedness Amount; and 

  

 (iii) (A) if the Closing Date Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the positive amount by which Closing Date Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital; or (B) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the Closing Date Working Capital, the negative amount by which Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the Closing Date Working Capital. 

 

If the Purchase Price Adjustment, as so calculated, is a positive number, then
the Closing Date Purchase Price shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the Purchase Price Adjustment, and if the Purchase Price Adjustment,
as so calculated, is a negative number, then the Closing Date Purchase Price
shall be 

  ##### 

  

   

decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the Purchase Price Adjustment. The
Closing Date Purchase Price plus or minus the Purchase Price Adjustment, if
any, shall be the final purchase price for the Equity Interests (the
"Purchase Price"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this  _Section
2.5(h)_ to the contrary, no increase or decrease to the Preliminary Closing
Date Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to this _Section 2.5(h)_ unless
the Purchase Price Adjustment exceeds the Minimum Adjustment, in which case
the entire amount of such adjustment shall be made. Within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment, Buyer
shall pay Seller or Seller shall pay Buyer, as the case may be, a sum of
money equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment. Any amount payable pursuant to
this _Section 2.5(h)_ will be made in immediately available federal funds,
by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Party receiving
such payment.

ARTICLE V 
 COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES 

   

 5.1 _Required Approvals  Permits, Coal Leases, Coal Sales Contracts and Material Contracts_. 

  

 (a) The Parties acknowledge that, to the extent that the Acquisition is considered to be a transfer of some or all of the Permits and Coal Leases by the Governmental Entity with regulatory jurisdiction in respect of such Permit or Coal Lease, it is possible that Buyer and Seller will need to obtain consent to the transfer of such Permits and Coal Leases from certain Governmental Entities in order to effect such transfers and consummate the Acquisition. The Parties also acknowledge that the Acquisition may require certain other Required Approvals to be obtained, as listed on _Exhibit D_. 

   

 (b) Promptly following the Effective Date, each Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts and cooperate in good faith with the other Parties to make all necessary applications, filings and requests, furnish all required supporting materials, pay all fees and application payments, and take all other actions reasonably required to obtain all Required Approvals as described below. 

   

 (i) _Permits and Coal Leases_. Subject to the mutual cooperation provision in  _Section 5.1(b)_, Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining all Required Approvals relating to the transfer of Permits and Coal Leases by the Governmental Entity with regulatory jurisdiction in respect of such Permits or Coal Leases, at its cost and expense. Seller agrees to promptly provide all information and true and correct versions of documentary material in Sellers or one of the Companies possession or control that may be reasonably requested by Buyer or any Governmental Entity in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain Required Approvals for the Permits and Coal Leases.

The Parties shall consult with each other regarding any changes to the Permits requested by the appropriate Governmental Entities. The Parties shall agree to all reasonable modifications that will take effect as of the Closing to those Permits issued by Governmental Entities that are requested by such Governmental Entities as a condition to granting consent to the transfer of such Permits and upon the request of either Buyer or Seller shall evidence such agreement in writing in a form satisfactory to the Party making such request acting reasonably; _provided,_ that such modifications shall take effect only in the event of a Closing.

Reasonable Efforts to obtain all Required Approvals relating to Transferred
Contracts; provided that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be obligated to incur
any material obligations or conditions with respect to such
Transferred Contracts or in connection with the obtaining of such Required
Approvals. Each Party agrees to promptly provide all information and true
and correct versions of the documentary material in its possession or control
that reasonably may be requested by the other Party in connection with
the efforts to obtain Required Approvals for the Transferred Contracts. In
the event any Required Approval is not obtained prior to the Closing with
respect to a Transferred Contract, such Transferred Contract shall be deemed
to be an Excluded Contract. 

  

 (iv) _Excluded Contracts_. Set forth on _Schedule 5.1(b)(iv)_ of the Disclosure Schedule are those Material Contracts which are not being transferred to Buyer in connection with the Acquisition (the "Excluded Contracts").

 (a) To the extent that it has not already done so, each Party shall, as promptly as is reasonable, and in any event not more than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, file, or cause to be filed, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (the "HSR Form") and any applicable foreign antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall request early termination of the applicable waiting periods with respect thereto, and Buyer shall pay all of the filing fees in connection therewith. Each Party shall bear the fees and expenses of its counsel in preparation of any such filings. 

   

 (b) Each Party shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, including the expenditure of material funds and the payment of reasonable fees and costs (including the fees of lawyers and other experts) to (i) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, and any foreign antitrust Laws, and any state takeover or similar statute, and to cause the receipt of Required Approvals under the HSR Act, any applicable foreign Law or any state takeover or similar statute, as soon as practicable, and (ii) cooperate promptly and fully with the other Party to make all necessary additional applications, filings and requests, furnish all required supporting materials, and take all other actions reasonably required to, and, in each case, supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Entity (including the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice) pursuant to the HSR Act, related Law, or any applicable state or foreign antitrust Law, and cooperate in connection with any filing under any applicable antitrust Law and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are commenced by any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the generality of the Parties undertaking pursuant to this  _Section 5.2(b)_, subject to _Section 7.1_, Buyer shall, at its expense and cost, use its best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party (including any Governmental Entity) in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing by the date that is three hundred sixty five (365) days from the initial filing of the HSR Form. 

   

 (c) Buyer and Seller will consult with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any legal proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act, related Law, or any applicable state or foreign antitrust law. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any legal requirement, in connection with any 

    ##### 

  

    

legal proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act, related Law, or any
applicable state or foreign antitrust Law, each of Buyer and Seller will
permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such legal proceeding and
if practicable, to have access to, review in advance and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with such legal proceeding. Each Party
shall promptly notify the other Parties of any communication it or any of its
Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that
are the subject matter of this Agreement, including any second request from
governmental entities. Each Party shall pay its respective the costs and fees
relating to any such review, preparation of additional materials, and
requests for additional information resulting from or in connection with
such filings. 

   

 5.3 _Surety Bonds_. Buyer shall obtain surety bonds and/or letters of credit or provide other financial obligation or assurances acceptable to the regulating Governmental Entity, including any changes required or requested by a regulating Governmental Entity (collectively, "Substitute Surety Bonds"), which Substitute Surety Bonds shall be effective as of the Closing Date and in full substitution for all of the surety bonds and letters of credit listed on _Section 5.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule ("Existing Surety Bonds"), and shall obtain the release of all of the Existing Surety Bonds in connection therewith. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller with respect to all Liabilities arising out of or relating to any such Existing Surety Bonds to the extent they arise in the first instance in connection with the period following the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by Buyer of Notice from Seller of a Claim for indemnification hereunder, fully indemnify Seller from any Claim or demand of, or Liability with respect to, all or any of the Existing Surety Bonds to the extent arising in the first instance with respect to the period following the Closing in the event that such Existing Surety Bonds have not been released to Seller prior to Closing, and such indemnification obligation shall not be subject to any limitations on liability set forth in _Section 8.4_. 

  

 5.4 _Guaranties_. Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies) have provided certain guarantees, indemnities and similar obligations relating to Coal Sales Contracts with third parties (each, an "Existing Guaranty"). If and only to the extent that there is an Existing Guaranty related to a Coal Sales Contract to be transferred from Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies) to Buyer or its Affiliates (including, if Closing occurs, one of the Companies) as of the Closing Date, then Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to cause the release of each such Existing Guaranty and the substitution of Buyer and/or an Affiliate of Buyer as the guarantor, indemnitor or responsible party (a "Substitute Guaranty") under each such Coal Sales Contract effective as of the Closing Date. To the extent that a Substitute Guaranty related to a Coal Sales Contract transferred by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies) to Buyer or its Affiliates (including, if Closing occurs, one of the Companies) is not in effect as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, with respect to any Liabilities arising out of or relating to any such Existing Guaranty to the extent they arise in the first instance in connection with the period following the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by Buyer of Notice from Seller of a Claim for indemnification hereunder, fully indemnify Seller from any Claim or demand of, or Liability with respect to, any Existing Guaranty related to a Coal Sales Contract transferred by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies) to Buyer or its Affiliates (including, if Closing occurs, one of the Companies) that is not in effect as of the Closing Date to the extent they arise in the first instance in connection with the period following the Closing, and such indemnification obligation shall not be subject to any limitations set forth in _Section 8.4_. 

  

 5.5 _Operations During the Interim Period_. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, during the Interim Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the

 5.8 _Company Employees_. 

  

 (a) Buyer or its Affiliates shall maintain, for a period of at least six months following the Closing Date, the employment of each Company Employee employed as of the Closing Date, except for the Excluded Employees, on such terms and conditions required by this _Section 5.8_. In the event Buyer or one of its Affiliates elects to terminate a Company Employee without cause during the six month period following the Closing Date, then Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall pay such Company Employee a severance amount equal to the greater of (A) the amount of severance benefits such Company Employee would have been entitled to under Sellers or Buyers severance plan (whichever offers greater severance benefits) then in effect, if any, or (B) the product of (i) one-half of such Company Employees annual base salary or aggregate hourly wages for the preceding twelve (12) month period, as the case may be, and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the six month period following the Closing Date determined from the date of termination and the denominator of which is 180. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyers benefit plans and programs which, in the aggregate, shall be reasonably equivalent in value to the wages, compensation levels and benefit plans provided to the Company Employees on the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall provide each Company Employee with credit for all service for vesting and eligibility purposes only under each employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of Buyer or its Affiliates in which such employee is eligible to participate, except to the extent that such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service and in accordance with the eligibility and vesting requirements contained under such plans. With respect to each group health plan or welfare plan provided by Buyer as of the Closing Date in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees, provided that if such plan is provided under an insured arrangement, such waiver will occur only to the extent otherwise permitted under the applicable insurance contract or agreement, provided, further, that Buyer shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to procure such waivers and (ii) provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such group health plan. 

   

 (d) Benefits accrued on or before the Closing Date with respect to all Company Employees who are participants in Sellers Retiree Benefits or Sellers Pension Plan shall be "locked and frozen" as of the Closing Date and Seller shall retain sole liability for the payment of such benefits as and when employees become eligible therefor under such plans. For purposes of this Section, the term "locked and frozen" means that employees who are plan participants shall retain their vested accrued benefits under Sellers Retiree Benefits or Sellers Pension Plan as of the Closing Date. Seller shall amend Sellers Pension Plan if necessary to ensure that all Company Employees who are participants in such plan as of the Closing Date shall become fully vested in their accrued benefits. 

   

 (e) Seller will cause Sellers Savings Plan to be amended in order to (i) provide that the Company Employees shall be fully vested in their accounts under Sellers Savings Plan and (ii) permit such individuals to elect to the extent permitted by Law, not later than six months after the Closing Date, to have their interest in Sellers Savings Plan transferred to any savings plan established or maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates at the discretion of the participant. As of the Closing Date, all employee contributions by the Company Employees and all obligations of Seller to make contributions in respect of such employees under Sellers Savings Plan shall cease. Seller and Buyer shall take such other steps as are required by Law or are otherwise necessary in order to permit the transfer of assets and liabilities from Sellers Savings Plan to any savings plan established by Buyer or one of its Affiliates. 

   

 (f) No provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person or organization, including without limitation employees or former employees (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Companies or Seller, unions or other representatives of such employees or former employees, or trustees, administrators, participants, or beneficiaries of any Employee Benefit Plan, and no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall create such third-party beneficiary rights in any such Person or organization in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan, including a currently existing Employee Benefit Plan. In addition, no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall amend, cause to be amended or be construed to be an amendment to, any Employee Benefit Plan or any plan sponsored by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer. This provision shall be given effect even if ratification or execution of this Agreement complies with an amendment procedure in any plan. 

    ##### 

  

     

 5.9 _Notification_. Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer will each, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, provide Notice to the other of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of the other Partys representations and warranties made as of the Effective Date or of any default in any material respect of the other Partys performance of its covenants and agreements herein; provided, however, subject to _Section 4.10(c)_, any failure to do so shall not waive any rights or remedies of the applicable Party.

 (c) The provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_ and _Section 5.10(b)_ shall not apply to information to the extent that the recipient Party: (i) can demonstrate at the time of disclosure is in the public domain; (ii) can demonstrate that after disclosure is published or otherwise becomes part of the 

    ##### 

  

    

public domain through no fault of the recipient Party or its Affiliates or its
or their respective Representatives (but only after, and only to the extent
that, it is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain); (iii)
can demonstrate by independent written documents already was in the

obtained from the disclosing Party or its Affiliates (whether in conjunction
with the Acquisition or previously disclosed), and that without breach of any
obligation to a third party, the recipient is free to disclose to others;
(iv) can demonstrate was received by it after the time of disclosure from a

 (d) Seller agrees that following the Effective Date through the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date that this Agreement is terminated, neither Seller, the Companies or any of their Affiliates, nor any broker, agent or other person acting on behalf of them, shall, directly or indirectly, through any representative or otherwise, solicit or entertain offers from, negotiate with or in any manner encourage, discuss, accept, or consider any proposal of any other Person relating to the acquisition of the Mine, the Equity Interests, the equity interests of the Subsidiary, or all or substantially all of the assets of the Business, whether directly or indirectly, through purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise. 

   

 (e) The Parties expressly agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.10_, that any such breach will result in imminent and significant harm to the Parties, and that the harmed Party shall be entitled to equitable relief for any such breach, including injunction and specific performance, for any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies for any such breach, but shall be in addition to all other legal and/or equitable remedies available to such harmed Party. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ supersede and replace the Confidentiality Agreement on and as of the Effective Date and the Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated at the Effective Date other than rights and obligations of the Parties that had accrued thereunder prior to the Effective Date. 

   

 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except for announcements of the Parties and/or their respective Affiliates that have been pre-approved by Seller and Buyer for release on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date, as the case may be, a Party shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing without affording Buyer or Seller, as applicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the same; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may make a public disclosure it believes in good faith after consultation with legal counsel is required by Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities. 

  

 5.12 _Supplemental Disclosure By Seller_. 

  

 (a) Seller may, from time to time prior to, but no less than four (4) Business Days prior to, Closing, by Notice to Buyer, amend, supplement, modify, create or add any section of the Disclosure Schedule in order to add information to, or change information previously set forth in, the Disclosure Schedule supplied to Buyer to the extent required to be added as a result of events or circumstances first occurring subsequent to the Effective Date. 

   

 (b) No such amendment, supplement, modification, creation or addition shall: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) be evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties or disclosures previously made by Seller are no longer true and correct; or 

  

 (ii) be deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of Seller for purposes of satisfying _Section 6.3(a)_; _provided_ that if any such amendment, supplement, modification, creation or addition would result in a Material Adverse Effect and Buyer waives the non-compliance with such condition and permits the Closing to occur, any such amendment, supplement, modification, creation or addition shall be effective to cure and correct for all other purposes any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant that would have existed if Seller had not made such amendment, supplement, modification, creation or addition, and all references to any section of the Disclosure Schedule that is amended, supplemented, modified, created or added as provided in this _Section 5.12_ shall for all purposes after Closing be deemed to be a reference to such section of the Disclosure Schedule as so amended, supplemented, modified or added. 

  

 5.13 _Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 2.9_ with respect to Transfer Taxes, or as expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller shall bear its own respective costs and expenses (including legal, accounting and consulting fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Acquisition. 

  

 5.14 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all separate entity Tax Returns for the Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date. For purposes of filing any Wyoming severance Tax Return (and any ad valorem Tax Return based on such severance Tax Return), to the extent permitted by Law, the Parties agree to close the taxable period with respect to such returns on the Closing Date. The allocation of such Wyoming severance Tax Liability (and any ad valorem Tax Liability) shall be determined in accordance with  _Section 5.14(d)_. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with the past practice of the Companies, unless otherwise required by Law. Seller shall permit Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing. Buyer or the Companies shall file such Tax Returns and shall pay the Tax shown thereon promptly at the direction of Seller. The cost of preparing such Tax Returns shall be borne by Seller. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 5.14(a)_, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Income Tax Returns for the Companies with respect to all periods up to and including the Closing Date and shall bear the cost of preparing such Income Tax Returns. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Taxes of the Companies, whether owed by the original Tax Return, amended Tax return, or as a result of an audit, with respect to such periods within ten (10) Business Days of payment by Buyer or the Companies of such Taxes and, without duplication, shall reimburse Buyer for Income Taxes imposed on any Company relating to any period prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Companies, other than the Tax Returns which Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, pursuant to _Section 5.14(a)_. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with the past practice of the Companies, unless otherwise required by Law. If any such Tax Return relates to any period beginning before the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller for its review, comment and approval a copy of the proposed Tax Return no later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing date of such Tax Return (including extensions thereof). Seller and Buyer shall consult and attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such proposed Tax Returns. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by the Companies or the treatment of an item shown on such Tax Return within fifteen (15) days, Buyer and Seller shall refer the matter to the Independent Accountants. Buyer and Seller shall equally share the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants and the 

    ##### 

  

    

determination of the Independent Accountants as to the amount owing by the
Companies with respect to the proposed Tax Returns shall be binding on both
Buyer and Seller for purposes of filing such Tax Returns. Subject to _Section
5.14(c)_, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Taxes of the Companies with
respect to such periods within ten (10) Business Days of payment by Buyer or
the Companies of such Taxes. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this _Section 5.14_, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Income Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire taxable period; and (ii) be the obligation of Seller, who shall pay such Taxes when due. Buyer shall be liable for all other Taxes and shall pay such Taxes when due. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with past practices of the Companies and shall be in conformity with the Code and any other applicable authorities except to the extent required by any Law. 

   

 (d) Any Wyoming severance Tax (and any ad valorem Tax based on such severance taxable value) shall be treated as attributable to the period ending on the Closing Date to the extent the coal which constitutes the base upon which such Tax was levied was severed on or before the Closing Date, sold on or before the Closing Date and the revenue from such sale was received on or before the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate fully and promptly, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns ("Tax Preparation") and (ii) any suit, action, inquiry, proceeding, administrative or judicial appeal, audit, litigation or other similar proceeding with respect to Taxes (a "Tax Contest"). Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Seller and Buyer agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller upon receipt by Buyer or its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened Tax Contest which may affect the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of, or otherwise relate to, Seller in respect of Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to represent all interests in any Tax Contest which will likely affect the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of Seller or Sellers Affiliates (and not Buyer or Buyers Affiliates), and to employ counsel of its choice in such Tax Contest; provided, however, that if the Tax Contest may affect the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of Buyer or any Buyer Affiliate, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax Contest, and Buyers consent shall be required prior to the settlement of any Tax Contest where Buyer may have any Liability, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller and its counsel in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any said Tax Contest. Buyer shall have the sole right, at its expense, to represent all interests in any other Tax Contest involving the Companies, and to employ counsel of its choice in such Tax Contest; provided, however, that if the Tax Contest may affect the Tax Liabilities or indemnification obligations hereunder of Seller or any Sellers Affiliate, Buyer shall keep 

    ##### 

  

    

Seller informed of the progress of such Tax Contest, and Sellers consent
shall be required prior to the settlement of any Tax Contest, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (f) Upon written request of Seller, Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax Return (other than an amended Income Tax Return) of any Company or claim for Tax (other than Income Tax) refund on behalf of any Company for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, provided that taking such position will not subject either Buyer, the Companies, or any of their Affiliates to additional Taxes or reduce any Tax asset or Tax attribute of Buyer or any Company. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on such amended Tax Return prior to filing and Buyer shall incorporate Sellers reasonable comments. The cost of preparing such amended Tax Return shall be borne by Seller. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any Tax refund received with respect to such amended Tax Return, net of any costs incurred by Buyer under this _Section 5.14(e)_. 

   

 (g) Any amended Tax Return of the Company or claim for Tax refund on behalf of any Company for any period ending after the Closing Date shall be filed, or caused to be filed, only by Buyer. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make or cause to be made, any such filing, to the extent such filing, if accepted, reasonably might change the Tax Liability or reduce a Tax asset or Tax attribute of Seller or any Company for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (h) Buyer shall not file an election under Treasury regulation 301.7701-3 or any comparable provisions of applicable Law of state or local jurisdiction to cause either of the Companies to be treated as anything other than disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal Tax purposes (or for purposes of such state or local jurisdiction), where such election has an effective date prior to the second day after the Closing Date. 

   

 5.15 _Assistance with Accounting Matters_. 

  

 (a) No later than 120 days from the Effective Date (unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties), Seller shall create or cause to be created and deliver to Buyer a copy of the audited balance sheet of the Companies at December 31, 2008 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the one year period then ended (prepared on a combined carve-out basis with such adjustments and allocations as Seller and its auditors may reasonably determine to fairly present that same (the "Audited Financial Statements"), for use by Buyer in meeting its requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, accompanied by an opinion of independent public accountants, which Audited Financial Statements shall comply as to form and content with all applicable requirements of Regulation S-X and will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Parties agree to mutually cooperate and provide updated information to one another with regard to the preparation and status of the Audited Financial Statements in order to assist with the scheduling of the Closing of the Acquisition. 

   

 (b) Seller will cooperate in good faith, and will instruct the Companies and its auditors to cooperate in good faith, with Buyer, at Buyers cost and expense, in connection with Buyers creation of all financial and other information, if any, necessary for Buyer to prepare pro forma financial statements and information in accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. 

   

 (c) Seller acknowledges that the Audited Financial Statements and opinion will be filed with the SEC and hereby consents to such filing, and Seller agrees to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain for Buyer any necessary consents to such filing from the public accounting firm performing such audit, subject only to such firms normal internal review, which consents shall be

Thereafter, Buyer shall have sixty (60) days within which to evaluate such Real Property Not Conveyed and to determine whether or not Buyer desires, in its sole discretion, to obtain ownership or control of such Real Property Not Conveyed, which it shall be entitled to do at no cost or expense. If Buyer elects to acquire any such Real Property Not Conveyed, then Buyer shall notify Seller prior to the end of such 60-day period, after which the Parties shall take such actions as shall be reasonably necessary to transfer, or cause to be transferred, such interest held by Seller, Jacobs Ranch, the Subsidiary or any such Affiliate, at no cost or expense, the ownership or control of such real property (whether by deed, lease, sublease or otherwise) from Seller or the relevant Affiliate of Seller as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days following Buyers notice of its intention to so acquire such Real Property Not Conveyed. 

   

 (c) On or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Buyer, Seller will assign, or cause to be assigned, to Jacobs Ranch (i) the current accounts receivable relating to the Coal Sales Contracts as of the Effective Time, and (ii) the unpaid accounts payable owed to unaffiliated third parties attributable to the Business as of the Effective Time, including without limitation, production Taxes, severance Taxes, reclamation Tax, black lung Tax and royalties attributable to the accounts receivables assigned to Jacobs Ranch pursuant to subsection (i), and in each case, Jacobs Ranch shall reflect such accounts receivable and unpaid accounts payable on its books and records, including on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to collect, and assist Buyer in the collection of, all such accounts receivable as the same become due, and shall remit to Buyer as promptly as possible any and all amounts received from any third parties with respect to such accounts receivable in accordance with Section 3 of the Arch Coal Supply Agreement, without any right of set off by Seller.

 (b) any breach or violation of any covenant, agreement or undertaking in this Agreement made by Seller or its Affiliates including, prior to Closing, the Companies; 

   

 (c) any fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional misconduct of Seller in connection with this Agreement; and 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) any employment by Seller or any Affiliate of, or services rendered to Seller or any Affiliate by, any finder, broker, agency, or other intermediary, in connection with the Acquisition, or any allegation of any such employment or services.

 8.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. The following procedures shall apply in respect of any Third Party Claim or other Claim for indemnification arising hereunder: 

  

 (a) As promptly as practical, but in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of a Claim by any third party (a "Third Party Claim") or after such Person obtains actual knowledge of the existence of a Claim other than a Third Party Claim, in each case with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive indemnification from the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") for any Liability, such Indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim; or (ii) material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon Notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim alleging any criminal or quasi-criminal wrongdoing (including fraud).

In any Third Party Claim with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of 

    ##### 

  

    

such Third Party Claim, shall have the right to participate in such matter and
to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense. The Party that has
assumed defense of a Third Party Claim, whether the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to keep the other Party reasonably apprised of the
status of the defense against the Third Party Claim and to cooperate in good
faith with the other Party with respect to the defense of any such Third
Party Claim. No Party may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment in connection with any Third Party
Claim with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld
only where such Party would be materially negatively impaired by such
settlement, compromise or consent to entry of judgment. 

   

 8.4 _Liability Limits_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Sellers obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Party from Liability shall be limited, in the aggregate, as follows:

The foregoing limitations shall not apply to a claim for indemnification to the extent such claim is based upon a breach of any of the Tax Representations, Tax covenants to make any payment or reimbursement contained in _Sections 5.14(a)_ through 5.14(d), or as a result of any fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 (ii) for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of Liability indemnifiable by Seller, the amount of each Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments by Seller under _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_ shall be limited to, the amount of Liability that remains after deducting therefrom any third Person insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or other similar payment actually received by a Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim. 

  

 (b) IN ANY CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO PARTY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFIT OR REVENUE, ANY MULTIPLE OF REDUCED CASH FLOW, INTERFERENCE WITH OPERATIONS, OR LOSS OF LENDERS, INVESTORS OR BUYERS, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS (OTHER THAN CLAIMS BY AN ASSIGNEE).

evidence and documentation of the nature and extent of the Liability as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 8.6 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival of Covenants_. The respective representations and warranties made by each party contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and, notwithstanding the Closing Date and notwithstanding any investigation or inquiries made by or on behalf of a Party, shall continue in full force and effect until the end of the Survival Period, except that: (i) any such representations and warranties relating to Tax matters (the "Tax Representations") shall survive the Closing Date and continue in full force and effect until after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation, including any suspensions, tollings or extensions thereof; (ii) a claim for any breach of any of such representations and warranties involving fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement may be made at any time following the Closing Date, subject only to applicable limitation periods imposed by Law; and (iv) no party shall be entitled to indemnification for breach of any representation and warranty set forth in the representations and warranties of each party unless a Claim Notice of such breach has been given to the Indemnifying Party within the period of survival of such representation and warranty as set forth herein. The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their terms, and, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, no party shall be entitled to indemnification for breach of any such covenant or agreement unless a Claim Notice of such breach has been given to the Indemnifying Party within the period of survival of such covenant or agreement. 

  

 8.7 _Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date_. Following the Closing, in the absence of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement, the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_ shall provide the exclusive remedy for breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 8.8 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered, to the extent permissible under Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

 Each Notice shall be effective (i) if delivered personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by nationally recognized overnight courier service, when delivered at the address specified in this _Section 9.1_ (or in accordance with the latest unrevoked direction from such Party), and (ii) if given by facsimile, when such facsimile is transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this _Section 9.1_ (or in accordance with the latest unrevoked direction from such Party), and confirmation is received; in both such cases if given on a Business Day during the normal business hours of the recipient and on the Business Day during which such normal business hours next occur if not given during such hours. 

   

 9.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Acquisition is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Acquisition be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 9.3 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.3_ , neither Party may assign this Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any person without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that (A) either Party may assign this Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations hereunder without prior written consent of the other Party (i) to one or more of its Affiliates so long as such Party remains primarily obligated hereunder or (ii) in connection with a change in control of such Party or the sale of all, substantially all or a material portion of the assets of such Party, and (B) Buyer may assign, pledge or mortgage all of its rights and interests under this Agreement to any provider of financing as security for Buyers or its Affiliates obligations under all documents and instruments evidencing, guaranteeing or executed by them in connection with any such financing. 

  

 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is exclusively for the benefit of Seller, and its successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and for the benefit of Buyer, and its respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Seller, under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third Person any remedy, Claim, Liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

 9.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Colorado, excluding conflicts of law principles thereof that would require or permit the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. 

  

 9.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of Colorado located in Denver, Colorado, in any action, suit or proceeding brought by or against such Party in connection with, arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Acquisition or any document contemplated by or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the Acquisition, and each Party hereby waives and further agrees not to assert as a defense in any such suit, action or proceeding any Claim that such Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such courts, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such courts. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING FROM, BROUGHT UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACQUISITION. 

  

 9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (including by facsimile) to the other Parties as required hereunder. 

  

 9.8 _Amendment; Modification_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented at any time except in a writing signed by Buyer and Seller. 

  

 9.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. Certain agreements and other matters are listed or described in the Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only, notwithstanding the fact that, because they do not rise above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they are not required by the terms of this Agreement to be listed in the Disclosure Schedule. In no event shall the listing of such agreements or other matters in the Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden or otherwise amplify Sellers representations and warranties, covenants or agreements expressly set forth in this Agreement, and nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall influence the construction or interpretation of any of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement. The headings contained in the Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the information contained in the Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement. Furthermore, the disclosure of a particular item of information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be taken as an admission by Seller that such disclosure is required to be made under the terms of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller made or given in this Agreement. Any fact or item set forth in the Disclosure Schedule that is required to be so set forth pursuant to a particular Section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section of this Agreement, if such disclosure would permit a reasonable person to find such disclosure relevant to such other Sections. The specification of any Dollar amount in the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any Disclosure Schedule hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including its Exhibits and Schedules, including the Disclosure Schedule) and other documents incorporated herein by reference constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all other prior
