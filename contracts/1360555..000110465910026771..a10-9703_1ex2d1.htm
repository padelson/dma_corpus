Parent_ "), CGI FAIRFAX CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and STANLEY, INC.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by U.S. Parent
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent and U.S. Parent propose
to cause Merger Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of Company Common
Stock of $37.50 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to
the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in
cash, without interest, subject to any reduction for any applicable
withholding Taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and the Company Board has resolved to recommend that the
holders of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and that they vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company
held for that purpose;

  



  

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company have approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub
into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain executive officers of the Company are entering into a
separate tender and voting agreement, pursuant to which such individuals are
agreeing, among other things, to tender their shares of Company Common Stock
in the Offer and to vote their respective shares of Company Common Stock in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein; and

        
   

  



  

WHEREAS Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the
Offer and the Merger;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# ARTICLE I _ 
  
 The Offer and the Merger_

  

# 

  

## SECTION 1.01. _The Offer._ (a) Subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than ten
business days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
and U.S. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer within the
meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent and U.S. Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay
for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are
subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A. The initial expiration date
of the Offer shall be midnight New York City time on the 20th business day
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole or
in part, any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce
the Offer Price, (iii) waive or amend the Minimum Tender Condition (as
defined in Exhibit A), add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify
any condition set forth in Exhibit A in any manner adverse to the holders of
the Company Common Stock, (iv) except as otherwise provided in this Section
1.01(a), extend the Offer, (v) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer or (vi) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to
the holders of Company Common Stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger
Sub may, in its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company, extend
the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer.  In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the
Offer any condition to the Offer is not satisfied, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent and U.S. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for one or
more consecutive increments of not more than five business days each (or for
such longer period as may be agreed by the Company); _provided_ , _however_
, that Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent and U.S. Parent shall
not be required to cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date. In addition, Merger Sub may and, if requested by the Company,
Merger

  



        
   

  



  

## Sub shall, make available one or more "subsequent offering periods", in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, of not less than ten
business days. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent and U.S. Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, pay for (subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant to Section
2.02(h)) all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
Offer.

  

## 

  

### (b)  On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent, U.S. Parent and
Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and
the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub
all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested by Parent, U.S. Parent
and Merger Sub for inclusion therein. Each of Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent,
U.S. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as
so amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities
laws. Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel in writing any comments that Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing of
the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the
SEC or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents,
Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or
response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent, U.S.
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company or its counsel, recognizing that the
ultimate form and content of the Offer Documents and the response to any
comments of the SEC will be the responsibility of Parent, U.S. Parent and
Merger Sub.

  

### 

  

### (c)  Parent and U.S. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of
Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions._ (a) The Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ").

  

## 

  

### (b)  Subject to Section 5.03(b), on the date the Offer Documents are
filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") describing the recommendations referred to in Section 3.04(b), and
shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Company Common Stock. Parent,
U.S. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or reasonably requested by
the Company for inclusion therein. Each of the Company, Parent, U.S. Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. The Company
shall provide Parent, U.S. Parent and their counsel in writing any comments
that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments.
 Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment
or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the mailing thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent, U.S. Parent
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final version thereof),
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent, U.S. Parent or their counsel, recognizing that the
ultimate form and content of the Schedule 14D-9 and the response to any
comments of the SEC will be the responsibility of the Company.

  

### 

  

### (c)  In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer
agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common
Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance
(including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and
computer files) as Parent or U.S. Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the Companys stockholders. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.05(a)), and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent, U.S. Parent
and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any

  



        
   

  



  

### such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such
information then in their possession or control.

  

### 

  

SECTION 1.03. _Top-Up Option._ (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub
an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, to purchase at
a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer a number of
newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal
to (and not less than) the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly
or indirectly owned by Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of
the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall
not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (and
not reserved for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The
Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, at such time as Parent, U.S.
Parent and Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, own at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (determined on a fully diluted
basis) (i) following the expiration of the Offer and any subsequent offering
period and (ii) prior to the fifth business day after the applicable
expiration date of the Offer or any subsequent offering period. The
obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Shares upon the
exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that no provision
of any applicable Law and no Judgment, injunction, order or decree shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise.

  



  

### (b)  The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery
of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance
with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). In the event
Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the
Company three business days prior written notice, specifying (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at
the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such
purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the
information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up
Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price
owed by Merger Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i)
in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance by Merger
Sub to the Company of a promissory note bearing interest at 5% per annum,
which shall have full recourse to Parent and U.S. Parent and shall mature on
the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 1.04. _The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.06). At the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.05. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
shall take place at a place mutually acceptable to Parent, U.S. Parent and
the Company on the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence
of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at Closing), or at such other time and date as shall be agreed
upon in writing among Parent, U.S. Parent and the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not
have been satisfied or waived on such second business day, then the Closing
shall take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall
have been satisfied or waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.06. _Effective Time._ On the Closing Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter the parties shall duly file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or certificate of
ownership and merger, as the case may be (in any such case, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at
such other time as Parent, U.S. Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.07. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.08. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at
the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit B and, as so amended, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

  

## 

  

### (b)  The Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which shall contain such provisions as are necessary to give
full effect to the exculpation and indemnification provided for in Section
6.06) shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 1.09. _Directors._ The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall from and after the Effective Time be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.10. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to

# ARTICLE II _ 
  
 Effect on the Capital Stock of the 
 Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

  

# 

  

## SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

## 

  

##### (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share
of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

##### 

  

##### (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._  Each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent, U.S.
Parent or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

##### 

  

##### (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ (i) Subject to Sections
2.01(b) and 2.01(d), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the highest price per share of Company
Common Stock paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest.

  

##### 

  

(ii) The cash payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is referred to collectively as the " _Merger
Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares
held in book-entry form, representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
(a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) As provided in Section 2.02(h), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable
Tax Laws.

  



  

##### (d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent and U.S. Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
and Parent and U.S. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent and U.S. Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

##### 

  

## SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and U.S. Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and U.S. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying
Agent to be held in trust for the benefit of holders of Certificates all the
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c)
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

## 

  

### (b)   _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or U.S. Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent or U.S. Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates

  



        
   

  



  

### in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent and U.S. Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
amount of Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (c)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or U.S. Parent,
upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or U.S.
Parent, as the case may be, and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof
with respect to the payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon.

  



        
   

  



  

### (e)   _No Liability._ None of Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.05), any such
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (f)   _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent or U.S. Parent. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to,
or as directed by, Parent or U.S. Parent. In no event, however, shall such
investment or any such payment of interest or income delay the receipt by
holders of Certificates of the Merger Consideration, or otherwise impair such
holders rights hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (g)   _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent or U.S. Parent by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect
of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (h)   _Withholding Rights._ Parent, U.S. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including any
payments made pursuant to the Offer and any payments made in respect of the
Appraisal Shares) to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any
holder of Company Restricted Stock or Company Employee Stock Options, such
amounts as Parent, U.S. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code (as defined in Section 3.11(c)) or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority by Parent, U.S. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of Company Restricted
Stock or Company Employee Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, U.S. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

officer of the Company by others within those entities.

## SECTION 5.02. _Control of the Operations._ Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or U.S. Parent, directly or indirectly, rights to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and the Company
Subsidiaries operations.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 5.03. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate the submission of any Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, term sheet or
other similar instrument with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or
(iii) enter into, continue, conduct, engage or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information
with respect to, or otherwise knowingly take any action to facilitate, any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions and negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and shall request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, the Company and its Representatives may, in response to a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Company Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal was
made after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of this Section
5.03(a), and subject to compliance with Section 5.03(c), (x) provide access
or furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of a
revised

  



        
   

  



  

## Company Takeover Proposal) with such person and its Representatives
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company will provide Parent
and U.S. Parent with all non-public information regarding the Company that
has not previously been provided to Parent or U.S. Parent that is provided to
any person making such Company Takeover Proposal.

  

## 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.02); _provided_ that
(i) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement need not contain any "standstill"
or similar covenant and (ii) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
may include provisions that are less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, so long as the
Company offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement concurrently with
execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to (y) include
substantially similar provisions for the benefit of the parties thereto and
(z) waive any "standstill" or similar covenant to the extent such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement does not contain any "standstill" or similar
covenant.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Company Takeover Proposal_ "
means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, including by way of a tender offer, exchange
offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination,
15% or more of the Company Common Stock or 15% or more of the consolidated
total assets of the Company, other than the Transactions.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Company Proposal_ "
means any bona fide written offer that was made after the date hereof and did
not result from a breach of Section 5.03(a) made by a third party that, if
consummated, would result in such person (or in the case of a direct merger
between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the consolidated total
assets of the Company, and which offer the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its independent
financial advisor) (i) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
the holders of Company Common Stock than the Transactions (taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and
any changes to the terms of the Offer or this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Company Proposal or otherwise, in each case as the
Company Board determines to be relevant) and (ii) is reasonably capable of
being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal as the Company Board determines to be
relevant.

  



  

(b)  Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub,
or

  



        
   

  



  

propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, U.S.
Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or
any such committee of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such
action (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to herein as
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or permit the Company
to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement relating
to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with Section 5.03(a)), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the acceptance
for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the
Company Board may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
(1) a Superior Company Proposal or (2) any material event, development,
circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts (including any
change in probability or magnitude of circumstances) not related to a Company
Takeover Proposal that was not known to the Company Board as of the date of
this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which
were not reasonably known to or reasonably understood by the Company Board as
of the date of this Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in each case
referred to in the foregoing clause (1) or (2) only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and its independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided, further_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall provide Parent and U.S. Parent with no less than five business
days notice of any Adverse Recommendation Change prior to such change, or (y)
in response to a Superior Company Proposal, resolve to accept such Superior
Company Proposal and concurrently cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); _provided, further_ that no
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) may be made unless
the Company Board shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent
that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
(a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall contain a description
of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change), and Parent
does not make, within five business days after receipt of such notice, a
proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisor, cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Company Proposal
to no longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal. If Parent has in
good faith proposed to the Company revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement during the five business day
period prior to the Company terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(f), the Company agrees that the Company and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (so long as
Parent and its Representatives are

  



        
   

  



  

negotiating in good faith) regarding any such revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Any material
changes to the financial terms or any material change to other material terms
of such Superior Company Proposal occurring prior to the Companys
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) shall require the
Company to provide to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new three
business day period and, in determining whether to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(f), the Company Board shall take into account any
such changes.

  



  

(c)  In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in
this Section 5.03, the Company shall, as promptly as possible and in any
event within one business day after the receipt thereof, advise Parent and
U.S. Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal
or request for information or inquiry that expressly contemplates or that
the Company believes could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such
Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any change to the
financial terms, conditions or other material terms thereof) and the identity
of the person making any such Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry.
The Company shall keep Parent and U.S. Parent reasonably apprised of any
related material developments, discussions and negotiations related to any
such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

  



  

(d)  Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.03(d) shall not
affect the obligations of the Company and the Company Board under Sections
5.03(a) and 5.03(b) (it being understood that neither any "stop, look and
listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, nor any accurate disclosure of factual
information to the Companys stockholders that is required to be made to such
stockholders under applicable Law or in satisfaction of the Company Boards
fiduciary duties or applicable Law, shall be deemed a modification of the
Company Boards approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement).

  



  

# ARTICLE VI _ 
  
 Additional Agreements_

  



  

## SECTION 6.01. _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting._ (a)
If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required
by Law, the Company shall, at Parents and U.S. Parents request, as soon
as practicable following

  



        
   

  



  

## the expiration of the Offer, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company, Parent and U.S.
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall notify
Parent and U.S. Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC
or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent and U.S. Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.  If at any
time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur
any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders
such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall provide Parent and
U.S. Parent and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall provide Parent and
U.S. Parent and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review all
amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to
requests for additional information prior to their being filed with, or sent
to, the SEC. The Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent, U.S. Parent or their counsel, recognizing
that the ultimate form and content of the Proxy Statement, any amendments and
supplements thereto, and any response to requests for additional information
will be the responsibility of the Company. The Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC.

  

## 

  

### (b)  If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents and U.S. Parents request, as
soon as practicable following the expiration of the Offer, duly call,
establish a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, through the
Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger as permitted by Section 5.03(b). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent acquires at least
90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties
shall, at the request of Parent and U.S. Parent, take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders meeting
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  

### 

  

### (c)  Parent and U.S. Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common
Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of
Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to
applicable Law and, with respect to any classified or controlled unclassified
materials, to Parents, U.S. Parents and their Representatives compliance
with any security clearance requirements and procedures or export controls
requirements (to the extent reasonably determined necessary by the Company in
order to comply with applicable Law), and upon reasonable prior written
notice, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
to, afford to Parent, U.S. Parent and to their Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time to all their properties, offices, personnel and books and records and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent and U.S. Parent all financial,
operating and other data and information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent or U.S. Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access shall not interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by such employees of their normal duties. None of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to (i) provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably
be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege)
or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement or (ii) provide access to or to disclose such portions
of documents or information relating to pricing or other matters that are
highly sensitive where such access or disclosure, as determined by the
Companys counsel, is reasonably likely to result in antitrust difficulties
for the Company or its affiliates. No investigation by Parent or U.S. Parent
or any of their respective Representatives and no other receipt of
information by Parent or U.S. Parent or any of their
respective Representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect
any representation or warranty of the Company or any covenant or other
provision in this Agreement. All information exchanged pursuant to this
Section 6.02 shall be subject to the non-disclosure agreement dated February
23, 2010, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
").

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.03. _Standard of Efforts; Notification._ (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, unless, to the extent
permitted by Section 5.03(b), the Company Board approves or recommends a
Superior Company Proposal, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly
as practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, Consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an

  



        
   

  



  

## action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary Consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed
and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, (A) the
Company and the Company Board shall, if any state takeover statute or similar
Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate and minimize the effect of such Law on
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, (B) the Company, Parent and
U.S. Parent shall promptly make all appropriate filings under any Antitrust
Law, including the notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act, and
take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act and (C) the Company, Parent and U.S. Parent shall
promptly (1) prepare, prefile and, no earlier than five business days
thereafter, file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to Exon-Florio
with respect to the Transactions, and shall provide CFIUS with any additional
or supplemental information requested by CFIUS or its member agencies during
the Exon-Florio review process within three business days of receipt of such
request, or if the Company, Parent and U.S. Parent mutually agree to seek an
extension in relation thereto, such longer period as CFIUS may allow, and, in
cooperation with each other, shall take all commercially reasonable
steps advisable, necessary or desirable to finally and successfully complete
the Exon-Florio review process as promptly as practicable; (2) submit to
the Defense Security Service of the United States Department of Defense ("
_DSS_ ") and, to the extent applicable, any other Governmental Entity,
notification of the Transactions pursuant to the NISPOM and any other
applicable national or industrial security regulations, and request from DSS
(and, to the extent applicable, such other Governmental Entity) approval to
operate the business of the Company pursuant to the existing U.S. Parent
Special Security Agreement (the " _U.S. Parent Federal SSA_ "); (3) submit to
the United States Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
notifications of the Transactions pursuant to the ITAR; and (4) make any
other submissions under Exon-Florio that are requested by CFIUS to be made or
that the Company, Parent and U.S. Parent mutually agree should be made in
connection with the Transactions. The Company, Parent and U.S. Parent shall
provide to each other such assistance, information and cooperation as is
reasonably required to obtain any such actions, nonactions, waivers,
Consents, approvals, orders and authorizations (including providing necessary
information, assisting in responding to any inquiries and attending joint
meetings with either Government or prime contractor customers advocating the
Offer, the Merger and the Transactions) and, in connection therewith,
shall notify the other person promptly following the receipt of any material

  



        
   

  



  

## comments from any Governmental Entity and of any request by any
Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional information in
respect of any registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such
Governmental Entity, shall give the other person the opportunity to attend
and participate in any meetings or conferences with the Department of
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, CFIUS, DSS, Department of State or any
other Governmental Entity and shall supply the other person with copies of
all correspondence between such person or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions (except for correspondence involving
personal identifier information (as defined in the applicable Federal
regulations) of Parent or U.S. Parent). In furtherance of the foregoing, if,
at the end of the initial 30-day review period under Exon-Florio, CFIUS
offers the parties an opportunity to withdraw and resubmit their joint Exon-
Florio notice regarding the Transactions in order to avoid an investigation
by CFIUS, and either the Company or Parent opts to request withdrawal and
resubmission in response to such offer by CFIUS, then the other party shall
agree to join the request for withdrawal and resubmission at the end of such
initial 30-day review period and immediately resubmit their joint Exon-Florio
notice regarding the Transactions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and its Representatives shall not be prohibited under this Section
6.03(a) from taking any action permitted by Section 5.03.

### (b)  Without limiting any other obligations of Parent and U.S. Parent
hereunder, Parent and U.S. Parent shall accept (i) all restrictions or
conditions imposed or requested by DSS on (A) the conduct or structure of
any business or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(including any requirement by any Governmental Entity to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of any assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary)
or (B) access by Parent or U.S. Parent to technology, operations, products
or other activities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (ii)
such other restrictions or conditions imposed or requested by DSS on the
operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or on Parents or U.S.
Parents control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including any
Reasonable Changes (as defined below) to the U.S. Parent Federal SSA);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Parent shall not be required to accept any
such restrictions or conditions, other than Reasonable Changes to the U.S.
Parent Federal SSA, with respect to Government Contracts that collectively
represent annual Company revenues in excess of $150.0 million (a " _Material
Limitation_ ") and (2) Parent shall in all cases be permitted, in its sole
discretion, as an alternative to accepting any such restrictions or
conditions, to sell or otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell or otherwise
dispose of, any Government Contracts or related assets. For purposes of this
Section 6.03(b), " _Reasonable Changes_ " shall mean any change to the U.S.
Parent Federal SSA that does not (w) substantially reduce Inside Director (as
defined in the U.S. Parent Federal SSA) representation on the Board of
Directors of U.S. Parent, (x)  significantly restrict the visitation and
communications rights of Parent and its affiliates under the U.S. Parent
Federal SSA in a manner that precludes Parent and its affiliates from
overseeing the operations of the U.S. Parent, (y) adversely impact the right
of Parent to appoint and replace members of the Board of Directors of U.S.
Parent such that

  



        
   

  



  

### it has a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent and its
affiliates to oversee the operations of the U.S. Parent or (z) impose
restrictions on the operations, access or other activities of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that are exclusively required under a Proxy Agreement
or Voting Trust under the NISPOM and other applicable rules and regulations
but not a Special Security Agreement, in each case other than any such change
that applies to every company governed by a Special Security Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c)  Parent, U.S. Parent and the Company shall work together in good
faith and use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain assurances that, in accordance with the NISPOM and other applicable
rules and regulations, the Surviving Corporation will be granted National
Interest Determinations (" _NID_ ") required for authorizing continued access
to proscribed information following the Effective Time to the extent
necessary for the Surviving Corporation to continue to perform the Government
Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the grant or support by customers of
Government Contracts of favorable NIDs shall not in any event be a condition
to the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction
contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

### (d)  The Company shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Parent or
U.S. Parent to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits Parents or U.S. Parents freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary; _provided_ that any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other

obligations under this Section 6.06(b) by causing the Company to obtain, on

material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
to such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required

### 

  

### (c)  From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted

Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section
6.06(c) for Losses arising out of actions or omissions by the Indemnified

undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

### (d)  This Section 6.06 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs

entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  

###

the Company shall promptly, at the option of Merger Sub, either increase the
size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its
current directors as is necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above. At such time,
the Company shall take all action necessary to cause individuals designated
by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole

Company, other than Section 3.19, Section 4.06, the last sentence of Section
6.02, Section 6.07, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall

or release any party hereto from any liability arising out of its willful
breach of this Agreement or any fraud.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 8.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at
any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;

agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.  Subject to the
proviso in Section 8.03, no extension or waiver by the Company shall require
the approval of the stockholders of the Company. Any agreement on the part of
a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.  The failure or
delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall
any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

  



         
 

  



  

## SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of

U.S. Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or
the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors.  Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the election
or appointment of Merger Subs designees to the Company Board pursuant to
Section 6.10 and prior to the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the Independent Directors shall be required for the Company to (i) amend or

an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section or
Article of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
 The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning

be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto",

disclosures included in such Filed Company SEC Documents that constitute
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking statements.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.05. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule or law, or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.06. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including by facsimile), all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more

rights or remedies, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise.

and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent, U.S. Parent or to any of
Parents other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, but no such
assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this
Agreement.  Any purported

  



        
   

  



  

## assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.10. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this
Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and
binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing
and executed and delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized
by such party to do so.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.11. _Enforcement._ (a) The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be unavailable, any Federal court
located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the
parties hereto (a) irrevocably submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any Federal court located
in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any Transaction in any court other than the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
shall be unavailable, any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and
(d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any suit, action or
proceeding directly or indirectly related to or arising out of this Agreement
or any Transaction.

  

## 

  

(b) Parent hereby appoints U.S. Parent as its authorized agent (the "
_Authorized Agent_ "), upon whom process may be served to enforce this
Agreement in any action, suit or proceeding that may be instituted in any
court described in this Section 9.11. Parent agrees to take any and all
action, including the filing of any and all documents, that may be necessary
to establish and continue such appointment in full force and effect
as aforesaid. Parent agrees that service of process upon the Authorized
Agent shall be, in every respect, effective service of process upon Parent.

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have duly
executed this Agreement, all as of the date first written above.

the rights of Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub, Parent and
U.S. Parent and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, may
be asserted by Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Merger
Sub, Parent and U.S. Parent in

  



        
   

  



  

whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent, U.S. Parent,
Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances
shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
