7 ARTICLE 2.

MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; PURCHASE PRICE; ADJUSTMENTS



Section 2.1 _Membership Interests_ _._ At the Closing, but effective as of the
Effective Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller shall sell, transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall purchase and acquire from Seller, the Membership Interests, free and
clear of any Encumbrances other than transfer restrictions imposed thereon by
applicable securities Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall cause
the Companies to transfer the Excluded Assets to Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Companies), prior to the Closing, and neither Purchaser nor
any of the Companies shall have any right, title or interest in or to the
Excluded Assets from and after Closing; provided, however, any such transfer
of the Excluded Assets from Company to Seller or its Affiliates shall be on an
"as is, where is" basis without any warranty of, indemnity of or liability
to the Company.



Section 2.2 _Purchase Price and Adjustments; Escrow._



(a) The aggregate consideration payable by Purchaser to Seller for the
Membership Interests (the _"_ _Purchase Price_ _"_ ) shall consist of
$367,730,870.00 (the _"_ _Base Purchase Price_ _"_ ) plus or minus, as the
case may be, the difference between the Net Working Capital as of the
Effective Date and the Net Working Capital as of the Balance Sheet Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date is
greater than the Net Working Capital as of the Balance Sheet Date, then the
difference shall be added to the Base Purchase Price. If Net Working Capital
as of the Balance Sheet Date is greater than the Net Working Capital as of
the Effective Date, then the difference shall be subtracted from the Base
Purchase Price. In addition, the Base Purchase Price shall be subject to
adjustment as provided in Sections 2.2(b), 2.2(c), 2.2(d), 2.2(e), 3.4, 6.15
and 9.2. 



(b) The Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of EBITDA of the
Companies for the period from the Balance Sheet Date to the Effective Date.



(c) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the aggregate amount of all
costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities relating to preparing for
drilling, drilling, equipping (including installing surface equipment) and
completing the wells and other Properties listed on the attached _Schedule
2.2(c)_ (and for any other wells not assigned an Allocated Value on _Exhibit
B_ for which Purchaser has approved Seller incurring such expenditures), in
each case to the extent such amounts have been paid by the Seller or any of
its Affiliates (including any of the Companies) prior to the Closing Date,
including costs of title review, filing for permits, surface damage and access
payments, access road construction and site preparation.



(d) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted for the actual aggregate gas
imbalance (net of royalties) affecting the Properties that exists as of the
Effective Date. Such imbalance in Mcf volumes shall be multiplied by $2.00 per
Mcf to determine the dollar amount of the imbalance adjustment to the
Purchase Price. The value so calculated of any net imbalance owing to the
Seller shall be added to the Purchase Price and the value so calculated of any
net imbalance owing by the Seller shall be subtracted from the Purchase
Price.



(e) Purchaser shall deposit $11,031,926.10 upon execution of this Agreement
by wire transfer of immediately available funds (the _"Earnest Money"_ ),
which shall be deposited and held by Seller in an account designated by
Seller, as earnest money and part of the Purchase Price. At the Closing, any
interest earned on the Earnest Money shall be applied to the Purchase Price.
If the Earnest Money is returned to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall
also receive any interest accrued  



 

8  thereon. If the Earnest Money is retained by the Seller as liquidated
damages pursuant to Section 2.6, then the Seller shall also retain any
interest accrued thereon.



Section 2.3 _Closing._ The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., at the offices of
Gable and Gotwals, 100 West 5th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma on the later of (i)
September 30, 2005, (ii) the second Business Day following closing of that
certain equity buyout transaction in respect of EXCO Holdings, Inc. as
described in the Form 8-K filed on August 29, 2005 filed by EXCO Resources,
Inc. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but not later than
October 14, 2005, or (iii) the second Business Day following the satisfaction
or waiver of any condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, or such
other date as Purchaser and Seller may mutually determine. The date on which
the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."



Section 2.4 _Effective Date._ The _"_ _Effective Date_ _"_ of the transaction
set forth in this Agreement shall be the first calendar day of the month in
which the Closing Date occurs, unless the Closing Date occurs after the tenth
(10th) calendar day of such month in which case the Effective Date shall
be the first calendar day of the month immediately after the month in which
the Closing Date occurs. The phrase "on or after the Effective Date" as used
herein means on or after 7:00 a.m. central time on the Effective Date.



Section 2.5 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Reconciliation._



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date or the
Effective Date, whichever is later, and in any event within 90 days
thereafter, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a calculation of Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Date and a calculation of any other
adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for in this Agreement, together
with reasonably detailed supporting information (the _"_ _Closing Statement_
_"_ ). The Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date shall be calculated
in the same manner as reflected on _Exhibit C_ (demonstrating the calculation
of Net Working Capital as of the Balance Sheet Date).



(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall each provide
the other Party and its representatives reasonable access to the records
relating to the calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date
and the calculation of any other adjustments to the Purchase Price provided
for in this Agreement as such other Party shall reasonably request and that
are available.



(c) Within 60 days after PurchaserÂ’s receipt of the Closing Statement,
Purchaser shall notify Seller as to whether Purchaser agrees or disagrees with
the Closing Statement and, if Purchaser disagrees, such notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement. If Purchaser
provides a notice of agreement or does not provide a notice of disagreement
within such 60 day period, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the
calculations and the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement delivered by
Seller, which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. If any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, then
Purchaser and Seller shall each use Reasonable Efforts for a period of 30
days thereafter to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations
in the Closing Statement.



(d) If, at the end of the 30-day resolution period, the Parties are unable to
resolve any disagreements as to items in the Closing Statement, then KPMG LLP
(or such other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing as
may be mutually selected by Purchaser and Seller) shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. If KPMG LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity
and the Parties are unable to agree upon a replacement, then Seller shall
within 10 days  



 

9  deliver to Purchaser a listing of three other accounting firms of recognized
national or regional standing and Purchaser shall within 10 days after
receipt of such list, select one of such three accounting firms (such firm as
is ultimately selected pursuant to the aforementioned procedures being the _"_
_Accountant_ _"_ ). The Accountant shall be charged with determining as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on
which such dispute is referred to the Accountant, any disputed items required
to determine the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date and any
other adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for in this Agreement. The
costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by
Purchaser. The determination of the Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Such amounts as finally determined by
the Accountant shall be used to determine the Purchase Price.



(e) Within five Business Days after the date on which the last disputed item
required to determine the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date
and any other adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for in this
Agreement is resolved pursuant to this Section 2.5, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Purchase Price minus the
Estimated Purchase Price, or Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of the Estimated Purchase Price minus the Purchase Price,
in each case together with interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (determined, as
applicable, on the Effective Date and at the end of each 30 day period
thereafter) plus 1% on such excess from the Effective Date to the date of
payment.



Section 2.6 _Breach or Failure to Close._



If Seller performs all of SellerÂ’s obligations under this Agreement, and if
within five (5) days after the date specified for Closing as provided herein,
the Purchaser fails to make any payment or to perform any of PurchaserÂ’s
obligations under this Agreement, and Purchaser shall not have terminated this
Agreement as permitted in Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.2, then the Earnest
Money (and any interest accrued thereon) shall be retained by Seller as
liquidated damages for the breach of this Agreement by Purchaser.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, retention of
the Earnest Money shall be SellerÂ’s sole remedy for any failure to make
payment or performance of any obligation of Purchaser prior to Closing. Seller
and Purchaser agree that such amount is intended as liquidated damages, and
not as a penalty, and is a reasonable amount for liquidated damages under
this Agreement, and that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to
determine actual damages. If the Purchaser performs all of PurchaserÂ’s
obligations under this Agreement, and if within five (5) days after the date
specified for Closing as provided herein, Seller fails to perform any of
SellerÂ’s obligations under this Agreement, and Seller shall not have
terminated this Agreement as permitted in Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.2, then
Purchaser shall be entitled to cancel and terminate this Agreement and receive
from Seller (i) a refund of the Earnest Money, together with all interest
accrued thereon, and (ii) reimbursement of all of PurchaserÂ’s actual out of
pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the recovery of the amounts set forth in (i) and (ii) above shall
be PurchaserÂ’s sole remedy for SellerÂ’s failure to perform any of SellerÂ’s
obligations under this Agreement prior to Closing.

(q) Any Encumbrances or other matters as to the ownership of the mineral,
royalty or surface estate dating from sovereignty to the date of acquisition

the normal course by an experienced and competent title attorney giving a
drilling or division order title opinion with respect to any Property, if a
drilling or division order title opinion had been rendered as to such
Property, and where such Encumbrances or other matters do not have a material
adverse impact on the Allocated Value of the specific Property so encumbered
when taking into account the age, remoteness, magnitude, nature and past

impact when taking into account the age, remoteness, magnitude and nature of
such Encumbrances or other matter;

(ii) which would be accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the
business of owning and operating oil and gas properties.



Section 3.4 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments._



(a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of Section 3.1, Purchaser must
deliver a written claim notice to Seller promptly after becoming aware of a
Title Defect but in any event on or before the date that is two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing (the _"Title Claim Date"_ ), except as
otherwise provided under Section 3.5. Such notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a specific description of the alleged Title Defects, (ii)
the Wells or Units affected, (iii) the Allocated Values (as described below)
of the Wells or Units subject to the alleged Title Defects, (iv) supporting
documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney
or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Defects and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the
Allocated Values of those Wells or Units are reduced by the alleged Title
Defects and the computations and information upon which PurchaserÂ’s belief is
based. Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of Section 3.1
for which Seller has not been given proper written notice as described above
on or before the Title Claim Date. The term _"Allocated Value"_ for any asset
of the Companies equals the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such
asset as described on _Exhibit B_. Seller, to the extent it desires to assert
a Title Benefit, must deliver to Purchaser, on or before the Title Claim
Date, a similar written notice as to each Title Benefit asserted.



 

13 (b) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date, Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable, but in any case by the Title
Claim Date, deliver to Seller a written notice including (i) a specific
description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Wells affected, and (iii) the
computations and information upon which PurchaserÂ’s belief is based. Seller
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser a
similar notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title
Benefit discovered by Seller. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title
Benefits of which neither Party has given notice on or before the Title Claim
Date, except to the extent Purchaser has failed to give a notice that it was
obligated to give under this Section 3.4(b).



(c) Seller and any Company shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to attempt, at SellerÂ’s sole cost, to cure or remove, on or before the
Closing Date, any Title Defects.



(d) With respect to each Well or Unit affected by Title Defects reported under
Section 3.4(a) and not cured during the period permitted under Section
3.4(c), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount (the _"Title Defect
Amount"_ ) equal to the reduction in the Allocated Value for such Well or Unit
caused by such Title Defects, as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(g).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4(d), no reduction
shall be made in the Purchase Price with respect to any Title Defect for which
Seller at its election executes and delivers to Purchaser a written indemnity
agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, under
which Seller agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser and its successors and assigns from any and
all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Title Defect.



(e) With respect to each Well or Unit affected by Title Benefits, the Purchase
Price shall be increased by an amount (the _"Title Benefit Amount"_ ) equal to
the increase in the Allocated Value for such Well or Unit caused by such
Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(h).



(f) Section 3.4(d) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to SellerÂ’s breach
of its representations and warranties in Section 3.1.



(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:



(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;



(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance which is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the affected Well or Unit;



(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue
interest for any Well or Unit and (B) the net revenue interest or percentage
stated on _Exhibit A_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of
the Allocated Value of such Well or Unit multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the net revenue interest decrease or percentage
ownership decrease and the denominator of which is the net revenue interest or
percentage ownership stated on _Exhibit A_ , provided that if the Title Defect
is not effective or does not affect a Well or Unit throughout its
entire term, the Title Defect Amount determined under this Section
3.4(g)(iii) shall be reduced accordingly;



(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Well or Unit of a type
not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) immediately above, the Title
Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into  



 

14  account the Allocated Value of the Well or Unit so affected, the portion of
CompaniesÂ’ interest in the Well or Unit affected by the Title Defect,
the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the affected Well or Unit, the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation;



(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A) an
individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given prior to
the Title Claim Date shall only be subject to adjustment under this Article 3
(except for adjustments required by Section 3.5) if the Title Defect Amount
with respect to such claim exceeds $100,000, (B) the aggregate Title Defect
Amount attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any given Well or
Unit shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Well or Unit and (C) except
for adjustments required by Section 3.5, there shall be no Purchase Price
adjustment for Title Defects unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Title Defect Amounts for all Wells or Units for which claim notices were
timely delivered in accordance with Section 3.4(a) exceed $2,000,000, and then
only to the extent that such amount exceeds $2,000,000;



 

(vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title
Defect Amount shall not be greater than the lesser of (A) the reasonable cost
and expense of curing such Title Defect or (B) the share of such curative work
cost and expense which is allocated to such Well or Unit pursuant to
subsection (vii) below; and



(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Well shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses (A) included in another Title
Defect Amount hereunder, (B) included in a casualty loss under Section 3.5, or
(C) for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the
adjusted Purchase Price. To the extent that the cost to cure any Title Defect
will result in the curing of all or a part of one or more other Title Defects,
such cost of cure shall be allocated for purposes of Section 3.4(g)(vi) among
the Wells or Units so affected on a fair and reasonable basis.



(h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Well or Unit multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the net revenue interest increase and the denominator
of which is the net revenue interest stated on _Exhibit A_ , provided that if
the Title Benefit is not effective or does not affect a Well or Unit
throughout the entire life of the Well or Unit, the Title Benefit Amount
determined under this Section 3.4(h) shall be reduced accordingly.



(i) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts by a date not less than ten (10) days after the
Title Claim Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date,
the Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section
3.4(i). During the 30-day period following the Title Claim Date, Title Defect
Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to a title
attorney with at least 10 yearsÂ’ experience in oil and gas titles in the
location that is the subject of the dispute, as selected by (A) mutual
agreement of Purchaser and Seller or (B) absent such agreement during the
30-day period, by the American Arbitration Association (the _"Title
Arbitrator"_ ). The Title Arbitrator shall not have had an affiliation with
either Party or their Affiliates within the seven (7) year period preceding
the arbitration, or have any financial interest in the dispute, controversy or
claim. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Tulsa, Oklahoma and shall
be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the  



 

15  American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section. The Title ArbitratorÂ’s determination shall
be made within 45 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall
be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
this Sections 3.4 and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of
the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.
Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested
third parties to advise the arbitrator, including without limitation title
attorneys and petroleum engineers. In no event shall any Title Defect Amount
exceed the estimate given by Purchaser in its claim notice delivered in
accordance with Section 3.4(a) and in no event shall any Title Benefit Amount
exceed any estimate given by Seller in a claim notice delivered in accordance
with Section 3.4(b). The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Purchaser shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Title Arbitrator.



(j) Seller may at its option and sole cost continue, after the Closing but
prior to the date of the final adjustment to the Purchase Price as provided
in Section 2.5, to attempt to cure or remove any Title Defects. If any Title

shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to
the business of Seller or the Companies. Purchaser agrees to abide by any
safety rules or rules of conduct reasonably imposed by Seller, the Companies
or the operator of such properties, as the case may be, with respect to
PurchaserÂ’s access and any information furnished to Purchaser or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 6.2. Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller, the Companies and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents from and against any and all Losses asserted
against or suffered by them relating to, resulting from, or arising out of,
examinations or inspections made by Purchaser or its representatives pursuant
to this Section 6.2, except to the extent such Losses relate to, result from
or arise out of, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or
the Companies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller, which may
be withheld for any reason, (i) Purchaser shall not contact any suppliers to,
or customers of, any of the Companies or their Affiliates, and (ii) Purchaser
shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the
properties or facilities of any of the Companies.



Section 6.3 _Consents._ For up to 180 days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Purchaser, at PurchaserÂ’s request, in endeavoring to obtain
any consents required with respect to Material Contracts, Leases or Permits;
provided, however, that such efforts shall not require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to incur any expenses or Liabilities or provide any financial
accommodation or to remain secondarily or contingently liable for any
Liability with respect thereto to obtain any such consent.



Section 6.4  _Regulatory Approvals._ [Intentionally Omitted]



Section 6.5 _Further Assurances._ Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use (and
Seller shall cause each Company to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest
practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



Section 6.6 _Confidentiality._ Purchaser acknowledges that the information
provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement
between EXCO Resources, Inc. and Seller dated August 3, 2005 (the  _"_
_Confidentiality Agreement_ _"_ ), the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference.



 

26 Section 6.7 _Preservation of Records._ Purchaser shall cause each Company to
preserve and keep the records relating to the Company for a period of seven
(7) years from the Closing Date, or, if longer, as required by Law. Purchaser
shall cause each Company to make such records and personnel available as may
be reasonably required by Seller in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims or indemnification claims by, Legal Proceedings or tax audits
against or governmental investigations of Seller or any of its Affiliates or
in order to enable Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby. In the event Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after that
time, Purchaser shall cause the applicable Company first to give ninety (90)
days prior written notice to Seller, and Seller shall have the right at its
option and expense, upon prior written notice given to Purchaser within that
ninety (90) day period, to take possession of the records within one hundred
and eighty (180) days after the date of such notice.



Section 6.8 _Use of Name._ Purchaser agrees that (i) it has no right, title or
interest in or to the name "ONEOK," "ONEOK Energy Resources," "ONEOK Energy
Resources Company," "ONEOK Energy Resources Holdings," "ONEOK Texas Energy
Holdings," "ONEOK Texas Energy Resources" or any service marks, trademarks,
trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related
thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing, including any derivations,
modifications or alterations thereof, and any word, name or mark confusingly
similar thereto (collectively, the _"_ _ONEOK Marks_ _"_ ), (ii) it shall
have no right to use the ONEOK Marks after the Closing Date, (iii) it shall
immediately after the Closing, change the name of each Company to remove the
names "ONEOK," "ONEOK Energy Resources," "ONEOK Energy Resources Company,"
"ONEOK Energy Resources Holdings," "ONEOK Texas Energy Holdings," "ONEOK Texas
Energy Resources" or any variations thereof from the name of the Company, and
otherwise cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with Seller or
any of its Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all ONEOK Marks from all
materials including any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery,
packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms,
computer software, technical guidelines, standards and procedures and
other materials. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Seller or its
Affiliates from using any of the ONEOK Marks before or after Closing.



Section 6.9 _Employee and Benefit Matters._



(a) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall offer employment to each of the
employees listed on _Schedule 6.9(a)_ (the _"_ _Company Employees_ _"_ ).
_Schedule 6.9(a)_ includes each Company EmployeeÂ’s name, position or job title
and work location, all as of the date hereof, unless otherwise specified
therein.



(b) Purchaser or its Affiliates may, but shall not be obligated to,
offer employment to all or any of the employees listed on _Schedule 6.9(b)_
(the _"_ _Additional Available Employees_ _"_ ). _Schedule 6.9(b)_ includes
each Additional Available EmployeeÂ’s name, position or job title and work
location, all as of the date hereof, unless otherwise specified therein. The
Company Employees who accept offers of employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates, together with any Additional Available Employees who receive and
accept offers of employment with the Purchaser or its Affiliates, are
collectively referred to as the _"_ _Transferred Employees_ _"_. Seller or its
Affiliates shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make offers of
employment to any Company Employees or Additional Available Employees.



 

27 (c) Each offer of employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates to a Company
Employee or to an Additional Available Employee shall be consistent with the
provisions of this Section 6.9 and shall remain open for a period of at least
fifteen (15) days. On or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Seller as to each Company
Employee and each Additional Available Employee who has accepted employment
with the Purchaser or its Affiliates, and each Company Employee and each
Additional Available Employee who has rejected or not responded to an offer
of such employment. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates with respect to all Losses relating to or arising out of the
employee selection and employment offer process described in the
preceding provisions of this Section 6.9 (including any claim of
discrimination or other illegality in such selection and offer process). The
transfer of employment of each Transferred Employee, as described in this
Section 6.9, shall be effective as of the Effective Date.



(d) The terms of employment (including all benefits) of the Transferred
Employees by the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be substantially similar or
superior to those terms of employment and benefits provided by Purchaser and
its Affiliates to their employees in similar positions and with similar
responsibilities as of the Closing Date. Effective as of the Effective Date,
all Transferred Employees shall cease to be employees of Seller or its
Affiliates. For a period of not less than one (1) year following
the Effective Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall pay each Transferred
Employee a base salary or wage not less than that paid by Seller or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall provide to each Transferred Employee an opportunity to earn
bonuses on the same basis as similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates.



(e) Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Employee and his or her eligible
dependents (including all such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s dependents
covered immediately prior to the Closing Date by a Seller Plan that is a
group health plan) to be covered under group health, prescription drug, dental
and similar type welfare benefit plans maintained by Purchaser or its
Affiliates that (i) provide benefits to the Transferred Employee and such
eligible dependents effective immediately upon the Closing Date and (ii)
credit such Transferred Employee, for the year during which such coverage
under such plans begin, with any deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
expenses already incurred during such year under Seller Plans that provide
similar benefits.



(f) Purchaser shall cause the employee benefit plans and programs maintained
after the Closing by Purchaser and its Affiliates to recognize
each Transferred EmployeeÂ’s years of service and level of seniority with
Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for purposes of terms of
employment and eligibility, vesting and benefit determination (but not benefit
accrual) under such plans and programs, including paid vacation, paid sick
time, severance benefits and employer contribution rates under retirement
plans. Purchaser shall cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods,
insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations or
restrictions under each employee welfare benefit plan or program sponsored by
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates so that each Transferred Employee will be
fully eligible to participate in each welfare Benefit Plan of the Purchaser
or its Affiliates as of Closing, except to the extent such Transferred
Employee was not eligible to participate in SellerÂ’s Benefit Plans as of
Closing.



(g) Seller shall permit each Transferred Employee to elect on the Closing Date
(or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable) a direct rollover of his or
her rolloverable account balance under the ONEOK Thrift Plan to a defined
contribution plan designated by Purchaser (the _"_ _Purchaser Savings Plan_
_"_ ), and Seller shall cause the ONEOK Thrift Plan to deliver to the
Purchaser Savings  



 

28  Plan as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date the promissory
notes and other loan documentation, if any, of the Transferred Employees
who have elected such a direct rollover in accordance with the procedures
prescribed by Seller. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and take such
actions, if any, as are necessary to permit the continuation of loan
repayments by Transferred Employees to the ONEOK Thrift Plan by payroll
deductions during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending 90 days
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that if a Transferred Employee
makes a direct rollover election as described in this Section 6.9(g) within
such 90-day period, then Seller shall cause the ONEOK Thrift Plane to continue
to accept loan repayments from such Transferred Employee by payroll deduction
until the date of such direct rollover. Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser
Savings Plan to accept the direct rollover of electing Transferred EmployeesÂ’
benefits in cash and, if applicable, promissory notes that are not accelerated
from the ONEOK Thrift Plan. Seller represents, warrants and agrees
with respect to the ONEOK Thrift Plan, and Purchaser represents, warrants and
agrees with respect to the Purchaser Savings Plan, that, as of each date of a
rollover described in this Section 6.9(g), such plan (i) is intended to
satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code and
(ii) will have received, or a pending application will have been timely filed
for, a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
regarding such qualified status.



(h) Claims of Transferred Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and
dependents for medical, dental, prescription drug, life insurance, and/or
other welfare benefits ( _"_ _Welfare Benefits_ _"_ ) (other than disability
benefits) that are incurred before the Effective Date shall be the sole
responsibility of the Seller Plans. Claims of Transferred Employees and their
eligible beneficiaries and dependents for Welfare Benefits (other than
disability benefits) that are incurred on or after the Effective Date shall
be the sole responsibility of Purchaser and the Companies. For purposes of the
preceding provisions of this paragraph, a medical/dental claim shall be
considered incurred on the date when the medical/dental services are rendered
or medical/dental supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose or
when the course of treatment began. Claims of individuals receiving long-term
disability benefits under a Seller Plan as of the Effective Date shall be the
sole responsibility of the Seller Plan. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, claims of Transferred Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and
dependents for short-term or long-term disability benefits from and after the
Effective Date shall be the sole responsibility of Purchaser and the
Companies (without regard to whether the circumstances giving rise to such
claim occurred before, on or after the Effective Date). Claims for workersÂ’
compensation benefits for Transferred Employees arising out of occurrences
prior to the Effective Date shall be the responsibility of Seller. Claims for
workersÂ’ compensation benefits for Transferred Employees arising out of
occurrences on or after the Effective Date shall be the responsibility
of Purchaser.



(i) Seller and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary or appropriate so
that the account balances under the Seller FSP of each Transferred Employee
who has elected to participate therein in the year in which the Closing Date
occurs shall be transferred, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
to the Purchaser FSP, and so that the contribution elections of each such
Transferred Employee as in effect immediately before the Closing Date remain
in effect under the Purchaser FSP for the remainder of the year in which the
Closing Date occurs. If the aggregate amount of the transferred account
balances of Transferred Employees is negative, then Purchaser shall pay Seller
the amount of such aggregate negative balance promptly following the account
balance transfer. If the aggregate amount of the transferred account balances
of Transferred Employees is positive, then Seller shall pay Purchaser the
amount of such aggregate positive balance promptly following the account
balance transfer.



 

29 (j) If Purchaser (1) fails to offer employment to any Company Employee or (2)
during the period from the Closing Date until the first anniversary date
thereof, terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee, other than for
retirement, resignation, death, disability or Cause (as defined below in this
paragraph), then, in either such case, Purchaser shall cause each such
employee to be provided with (i) payment in full for all accrued but unused
vacation time, plus (ii) severance benefits (which shall be paid in a single,
lump sum payment) equal to the highest level of severance benefits described
in the severance plan that Purchaser and its Affiliates make available to
their similarly situated employees and that would have been provided to such
employee if his or her employment had been terminated under circumstances
entitling such employee to such benefits under such severance plan; provided,
however, that in no event shall any such severance benefits be less than two
(2) weeks of base pay for each year of recognized service (with the years of
service rounded to the nearest full year), subject to, for purposes of this
proviso, a minimum of ten (10) weeks of annual base pay. For the purpose of
calculating the amount of any severance compensation in respect of such
severance benefit, Purchaser shall ensure that each such employeeÂ’s period of
service prior to the Closing Date is taken into account as set forth in
Section 6.9(c). For purposes of this Section 6.9(j), the term  _"_ _Cause_
_"_ shall mean that the employee (1) has engaged in gross negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of the duties of his or her employment,
(2) has materially breached any material provision of any written agreement
between the employee and his or her employer, (3) has willfully disregarded
any written corporate policies established by his or her employer, (4) has
willfully engaged in conduct that the employee knows or should know is
materially injurious to his or her employer, or (5) has been convicted of a
crime involving moral turpitude or any felony.



 

(k) All service credited under the vacation policies of Seller or its
Affiliates for Transferred Employees for the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, including unused balances as set forth on Schedule 6.9(a) and
Schedule 6.9(b), as may be increased or decreased as of the Closing Date based
on actions of the Transferred Employees after the date hereof, shall be
recognized by Purchaser. 



(l) Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to (1) give rise to any
rights, claims, benefits, or causes of action to a Transferred Employee or (2)
prevent, restrict, or limit the Purchaser, following the Closing Date, from
modifying or terminating any of its benefit plans, programs or policies from
time to time as it may deem appropriate, subject only to compliance with the
express provisions of this Section 6.9 for the benefit of Seller.



Section 6.10 _Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules._ From time to time
prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right to supplement or amend the
Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the
delivery of the Schedules pursuant to this Agreement. No such supplement or
amendment shall have any effect on the satisfaction of the condition to
Closing set forth in Section 7.1(a).



Section 6.11 _Company Guarantees._



(a) Purchaser and Seller shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from the respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller, on or before the Closing, valid and binding written
releases of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), as applicable,
from any liability or obligation, whether arising before, on or after the
Closing Date, under any Company Guarantees in effect as of the Closing. To
the extent necessary, Purchaser agrees to provide substitute guarantees with
terms that are at least as favorable to the counterparty as the  



 

30  terms of the applicable Company Guarantees and to furnish letters of credit,
institute escrow arrangements, post surety or performance bonds or make
other arrangements as the counterparty may reasonably request. If any Company
Guarantee has not been released as of the Closing Date, then Purchaser and
Seller shall each continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts after
the Closing to cause each such unreleased Company Guarantee to be released
promptly.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, Seller
and its Affiliates may, in their sole discretion, take any action to
terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit their liability under any and
all outstanding Company Guarantees.



(c) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and after the Closing for any Losses arising out of or relating to any Company
Guarantees to the extent arising from or related to matters involving the
Company or Purchaser.



Section 6.12  _Intercompany Contracts; Intercompany Balances._ Except as set
forth on _Schedule 6.12_ , all contracts, agreements and arrangements
(excluding any Tax sharing or allocation agreements) between and among any
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Company), on the other hand, including hedging arrangements, shall continue in
full force and effect, unaffected by the consummation of this Agreement.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.12_ , all intercompany balances between
and among any Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than any Company), on the other hand, shall be eliminated by dividend,
capital contribution, discharge or otherwise in their entirety effective as
of the Effective Date.



Section 6.13 _Insurance._ Until Closing, Seller shall keep, or cause to be
kept, all material insurance policies maintained by the Seller for the benefit
of the Companies, or suitable replacements therefor (which may
include policies containing terms equal or more favorable than the policies
that they are replacing), in full force and effect.



Section 6.14 _Environmental Remediation._ Purchaser shall not conduct (or have
conducted on its behalf) any material remediation operations with respect to
any claimed Losses relating to a breach of SellerÂ’s representation or warranty
pursuant to Section 4.16 or any claim relating to the subject matter of such
representation or warranty without first giving Seller notice of the
remediation with reasonable detail at least 45 days prior thereto (or such
shorter period of time as shall be required by any Governmental Authority).
Seller shall have the option (in its sole discretion) to conduct (or have
conducted on their behalf) such remediation operations. If Seller shall not
have notified Purchaser of their agreement to conduct such remediation
operations within such specified period, then Purchaser may conduct (or have
conducted on its behalf) such operations. Purchaser and Seller agree that any
remediation activities undertaken with respect to any CompanyÂ’s assets,
whether conducted by Purchaser or Seller, shall be reasonable in extent and
cost effective and shall not be designed or implemented in such a manner as
to exceed what is required to cause a condition to be brought into compliance
with Environmental Laws. All remediation activities conducted by Seller under
this Agreement shall be conducted to the extent reasonably possible so as not
to interfere substantially with PurchaserÂ’s operation of any CompanyÂ’s assets.



Section 6.15 _Vehicle Leases._ With respect to the vehicles listed on the
attached _Schedule 6.15_ (the _"Leased Vehicles"),_ Seller shall cause the
Companies to purchase such Leased Vehicles from the applicable lessors,
pursuant to the terms set forth in the applicable leases or as otherwise  



 

31  required by such lessors, and the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
actual amount paid to the applicable lessors to purchase the Leased
Vehicles. 



Section 6.16 _Transition Services._ Seller and Purchaser hereby agree to
negotiate in good faith to enter into a transition services agreement as
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto before the Closing, provided
however, that nothing in this Section 6.16 shall create a condition to
Closing, and the failure of Seller and Purchaser to mutually agree upon a
transition services agreement shall not affect the parties obligations to
close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser understands
and agrees that SellerÂ’s obligation to provide transition services under the
transition services agreement shall be limited to the provision of: (i)
reasonable office space, (ii) reasonably necessary IT services, and (iii) to
the extent permitted by any third party licensor of Seller, access to
SellerÂ’s accounting, land, production reporting and measurement systems.
Seller shall provide such transition services at SellerÂ’s cost. Purchaser
and/or Company, as applicable, each agree to provide to Seller transition
services and access to Company records as is reasonably necessary to allow
Seller to perform all customary accounting and financial reporting activities
related to SellerÂ’s ownership, control and/or operation of the Company,
including monthly, quarterly and year-end financial and tax reporting.
Purchaser shall provide such transition services at PurchaserÂ’s cost. Neither
Party shall be obligated to acquire new, additional or different personnel,
equipment or resources, or to acquire or establish any separate hardware or
software platforms to perform such transition services. The Parties may use
Affiliates, contractors, subcontractors, vendors or other third parties to
provide some or all of the transition services. Unless otherwise specifically
provided in a mutually agreed upon transition services agreement, the
transition services will be available only for a period of six (6) months from
the Closing Date. Purchaser understands and agrees that Seller shall have no
obligation to provide transition services to Purchaser to the extent the
Company Employees or the Additional Available Employees that typically provide
such services are no longer available to Seller.

ARTICLE 9.

TAX MATTERS



Section 9.1 _Transaction Taxes._ All transfer, documentary, recording,
notarial, sales, use, registration, stamp and other similar taxes, fees and
expenses (including, but not limited to, all applicable stock transfer, real
estate transfer or gains Taxes and including any penalties, interest and
additions to such tax) ( _"_ _Transaction Taxes_ _"_ ) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne
by Purchaser, to the extent that Purchaser is legally obligated to pay those
Transaction Taxes, and shall be borne by the Seller, to the extent that Seller
is legally obligated to pay Transaction Taxes, regardless of whether the tax
authority seeks to collect such Taxes from Seller or Purchaser. Purchaser and
the Seller shall cooperate in timely making and  



 

34  filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of
laws relating to such Transaction Taxes. Seller shall prepare all tax
filings related to any Transaction Taxes. Fifteen (15) days prior to making
such filings, Seller shall provide to Purchaser SellerÂ’s work papers for
PurchaserÂ’s review and approval. Ten (10) days prior to the filing date,
Purchaser shall provide to Seller approval of such work papers. Within ten
(10) days of receiving notice from Seller of the amount of Transaction Taxes
due, Purchaser shall pay such amount to Seller for remittance to the
applicable Governmental Authority. Seller shall give prompt written notice to
Purchaser of any proposed adjustment or assessment of any Transaction Taxes
with respect to the transaction, or of any examination of said transaction in
a sales, use, transfer or similar tax audit. In any proceedings, whether
formal or informal, Seller shall permit Purchaser to participate and control
the defense of such proceeding and shall take all actions and execute all
documents required to allow such participation. Seller shall not negotiate
a settlement or compromise of any Transaction Taxes without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.



 

Section 9.2 _Real and Personal Property Taxes._ All real and personal property
Taxes and assessments arising with respect to the Companies shall be prorated
between Purchaser and Seller based on the relative periods of time the
Companies were owned by each Party or their respective Affiliates (based on
the Effective Date) during the fiscal period for which such Taxes are imposed
by the applicable Tax Authority (as such fiscal period is or may be reflected
on the bill rendered by such Tax Authority). Purchaser shall pay to Seller at
Closing (or an appropriate increase shall be made to the Purchase Price), to
reflect SellerÂ’s estimate of PurchaserÂ’s pro rata share of each CompanyÂ’s ad
valorem tax liability for the calendar year in which Closing occurs. Upon
receipt by Seller of the tax bill, invoice or other statement regarding such
real and personal property Taxes, Seller shall calculate the actual pro rata
share of such tax bill, invoice or other statement attributable to each of
Purchaser and Seller. Seller shall forward, as soon as practicable, to
Purchaser a copy of such tax bill, invoice or statement along with the
supporting documentation relating to the calculation of the pro rata share to
Purchaser. If PurchaserÂ’s actual pro rata share of the CompaniesÂ’ ad valorem
tax liability is greater than the estimated amount paid by Purchaser, as set
forth above, then Purchaser shall forward to Seller payment in immediately
available funds of the additional amount of its pro rata share of such Taxes.
If PurchaserÂ’s actual pro rata share of such tax liability is less than the
estimated amount paid, then Seller shall forward to Purchaser the difference
in such amounts. Seller will pay the full amount of the tax bill, invoice or
statement to the applicable Tax Authority. In the event Purchaser
first receives a tax bill, invoice or statement relating to any Company from
a Tax Authority for ad valorem taxes for the year in which Closing occurs,
Purchaser shall immediately forward such tax bill, invoice or statement to
Seller. Purchaser will be responsible for filing all ad valorem Tax Returns
for each all of the Companies for the calendar years 2006 and beyond.



Section 9.3 _Taxes Based on Revenues._ All sales, franchise, gross receipts
and other similar Taxes based upon revenues relating to any Company shall be
prorated between Purchaser and Seller, with Seller being obligated to
reimburse Purchaser only for the portion of any such Tax that is applicable to
the cash received by Seller prior to the Effective Date that relates to
the revenues of the Company being taxed. Upon receipt by Purchaser of the Tax
Return, tax bill, invoice or other statement regarding such Taxes, Purchaser
shall calculate the pro rata share of such Tax Return, tax bill, invoice or
other statement attributable to Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser then shall
forward, as soon as practicable, to Seller a copy of such tax bill, invoice or
statement along with the supporting documentation relating to the calculation
of the pro rata share to Seller. Seller then shall forward to Purchaser
payment in immediately available funds of its pro rata share of such Taxes as
soon as  



 

35  practicable in advance of the due date of the tax bill, invoice or statement
and in time to avoid the incurrence of penalties or interest. Upon its
receipt of such payment, Purchaser will pay the full amount of the tax bill,
invoice or statement to the applicable Tax Authority. In the event Seller
first receives a tax bill, invoice or statement relating to the revenues of
any Company from a Tax Authority, Seller shall immediately forward such tax
bill, invoice or statement to Purchaser.



Section 9.4 _Section 338(h)(10) Election._ Purchaser and Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall make timely, joint elections under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10) and any
comparable election under foreign, state or local tax law (the " _Elections"_
) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Membership Interests pursuant
to this Agreement. Purchaser shall be responsible for and control the
preparation and filing of the Elections in accordance with the allocation of
the Purchase Price described in Section 9.5 below. In particular, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser all information reasonably requested to enable Purchaser
to prepare Forms 8023 and all attachments required to be filed therewith (the
" _Forms"_ ), including the schedule of data required by the Forms, no later
than ninety (90) days before the Forms are due to be filed. Once prepared by
Purchaser, a draft copy of the Forms shall be forwarded to Seller for its
approval at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing due date for the Forms
and which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Forms
shall be duly executed by an authorized person for each Party and duly and
timely filed by Purchaser on behalf of Purchaser and Seller (or its applicable
Affiliate). The Purchaser and Seller will file all Tax Returns (including the
Forms) in a manner consistent with such election. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller agrees that any income and
gain recognized as a result of, and in accordance with (i) the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election will be included in SellerÂ’s Federal and
applicable foreign, state and local income tax returns. Seller shall be liable
for and shall timely pay to the appropriate Governmental Authorities
an amount equal to the resulting Tax liability attributable to the Section
338(h)(10) Election, and (ii) if the 338(h)(10) Election is disallowed by the
Governmental Authority and such disallowance is agreed to by Seller or upheld
by any court (in whole or in part), provided such court decision is final and
nonappealable, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the
amount of such Tax liability.



Section 9.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price._ As promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the _"_ _Allocation Statement_ _"_
) allocating the Purchase Price among the assets of the Companies
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder and consistent with the allocation set forth on
_Exhibit B_. Seller shall have fifteen (15) days to review the Allocation
Statement and shall notify Purchaser of any disputes with the allocation as
set forth in the Allocation Statement. Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date that is sixty (60)
days prior to the due date of the Tax Returns that reflect the allocation. If
Seller and Purchaser cannot resolve the disputed allocation prior to such
date, then Seller and Purchaser shall refer the dispute to the Accountant to
review and to determine the proper allocation (it being understood that in
making such determination, the Accountant shall be functioning as an expert
and not as an arbitrator). The Accountant shall deliver to Seller and
Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than
thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Accountant), a
determination of the allocation. This determination will be binding on the
Parties hereto and all Tax Returns filed by Purchaser, Seller and each of
their Affiliates shall be prepared consistently with such allocation. The
cost of such review and report shall be borne by Purchaser.



 

36 Section 9.6 _Conflict._ In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Article 9, on the one hand, and the provisions of Article 10, on the
other hand, the provisions of this Article 9 shall control.



ARTICLE 10.

INDEMNIFICATION 



Section 10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants._ The
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until nine (9) months after the Closing Date, except
that (a) the representations and warranties in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.20,
5.1, 5.2, 5.5 and 5.6 shall survive until the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date, and (b) the representations and warranties in Section 4.10 shall survive
the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
and (c) the representations and warranties in Section 3.1 shall expire as of
the Title Claim Date as provided in Section 3.6. All of the covenants made by
each Party in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and shall continue in full force and effect
after the Closing indefinitely until all obligations with respect to any such
covenants are fulfilled in their entirety.



Section 10.2 _Indemnification by Seller._



(a) Subject to Sections 6.10, 10.1 and 10.5 hereof, Seller hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, the Companies and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents, attorneys,
representatives and permitted assigns (collectively, the _"Purchaser
Indemnified Parties"_ ) from and against any Losses incurred by any of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties based upon or arising directly from any breach
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by Seller in
this Agreement; provided, however _,_ that the sole remedies for breach of
SellerÂ’s representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 relating to
Title Matters are only those remedies set forth in Article 3, and SellerÂ’s
indemnification obligations under this Section 10.2(a) shall not apply
thereto.



(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall not have any liability
under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent that such
Loss relates to action taken by Purchaser or any other Person (other than
Seller in breach of this Agreement) after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate
any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to the Loss.



(c) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and the
Company against any failure by Seller to pay all Taxes (i) incurred
with respect to the 338 (h)(10) Election and (ii) relating to the Company and
its subsidiaries for all Tax Periods (or portions thereof) that end on or
prior to the Closing Date, including other liabilities, costs, expenses
(including without limitation attorneysÂ’ and accountantsÂ’ fees and expenses),
losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of or
incident to SellerÂ’s failure to pay such Taxes.



Section 10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser._

 



(a) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.5, Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold Seller and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives and permitted assigns
(collectively, the _"Seller Indemnified Parties"_ ) harmless from and
against any Losses incurred by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties based
upon or arising directly from (i) any  



 

37  breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by
Purchaser in this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section
10.2(a), all Liabilities of any of the Companies arising on, before or after
the Closing Date.



(b) Seller shall take and cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably
be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to
the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to the Loss.



Section 10.4 _Indemnification Procedures._



(a) In the event that any Legal Proceeding shall be instituted, or that any
claim shall be asserted, by any Person in respect of which payment may be
sought under Sections 10.2 or 10.3 hereof (an _"Indemnification Claim"_ ), the
indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice in reasonable detail of
the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge that is
covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The
indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim that relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim
that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall, within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the written notice of the Indemnification
Claim, notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the
indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim that relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim. If the
indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Indemnification Claim, the
indemnified party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of
such Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the indemnifying party if, (i) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The Parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.4 to the contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying partyÂ’s willingness to
accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of
Section 10.5, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified
party declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to
contest such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the
indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to
pay hereunder, subject to the applicable limitations of Section 10.5, shall
be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that the  



 

38  indemnified party declined to accept plus the Losses of the indemnified
party relating to such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection
of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes
any payment on any Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified
party with respect to such Indemnification Claim.



(b) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the
indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums
due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter.



Section 10.5 _Limitations on Indemnification._



(a) A Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert an Indemnification
Claim pursuant to Section 10.2(a) with respect to representations and
warranties of the Seller only to the extent the Purchaser Indemnified Party
gives notice of the Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 10.4(a) prior to
the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in Section 10.1 for
such representation and warranty. Any Indemnification Claim not made in
accordance with Section 10.4(a) by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties on or
prior to the applicable date set forth in Section 10.1 or herein, and
SellerÂ’s indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will be irrevocably
and unconditionally released and waived by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10, Seller shall not
have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section 10.2(a), (i)
for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is less than $100,000
and (ii) in respect of each individual item where the Loss relating thereto is
equal to or greater than $100,000, unless the aggregate amount of all such
Losses exceeds $11,031,926.10, and then only to the extent of such excess. In
no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses to be paid by Seller under
Section 10.2(a) exceed $36,773,087.00.



(c) No representation or warranty of Seller contained herein shall be deemed
untrue or incorrect, and Seller shall not be deemed to have breached a
representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
circumstance or event of which (i) is disclosed in response to another
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or (ii) Purchaser is
aware as of the date of this Agreement.



(d) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification
under this Article 10 in respect of any matter that is taken into account in
the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price made pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.



(e) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 10 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
indemnified party under insurance policies, and net of any Tax Benefit
realized by Purchaser with respect to such Losses. Purchaser and/or Company
shall be obligated to seek such Tax Benefits and pursue any recoverable
amounts under insurance policies, provided however that Seller shall make
payment to Purchaser or Company, as applicable, for any indemnifiable costs
and expenses, as such costs and expenses are incurred by Purchaser or Company.
Purchaser or Company, as applicable, shall promptly remit to Seller any  



 

39  amounts recovered or Tax Benefits realized to the extent Seller has
previously made payment to Purchaser and/or Company for such Losses.



(f) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the condition, operations,
assets (including all plugged or abandoned wells) and business of the
Companies and, in making its determination to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties has
relied on the results of PurchaserÂ’s independent investigation.



(g) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges that the Properties and other
assets of the Companies have asbestos-containing materials. Seller hereby
disclaims all liability and responsibility with respect to any claims or
Liabilities arising therefrom or related thereto, and Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges that
it shall have no claims against Seller or its Affiliates with respect thereto.



Section 10.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments._ Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article 10 as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income
tax purposes.



Section 10.7 _NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES._ NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR PROVIDED FOR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE
LAW, NO PARTY SHALL, IN ANY EVENT, BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PERSON, EITHER IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT, FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF SUCH OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING LOSS OF FUTURE REVENUE,
INCOME OR PROFITS, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR
OPPORTUNITY RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH HEREOF, WHETHER OR NOT
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES HAS BEEN DISCLOSED TO THE OTHER PARTY
IN ADVANCE OR COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FORESEEN BY SUCH OTHER PARTY. THE
EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
AS SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY SUCH DAMAGES
SOUGHT BY THIRD PARTIES AGAINST A PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR A SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY, AS THE CASE MAY BE, IN CONNECTION WITH LOSSES THAT MAY BE
INDEMNIFIED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE 10.



Section 10.8 _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY._ SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 2.6,
SELLER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF THE OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES,
AND PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF THE OTHER PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
BREACH OR INACCURACY, OR ALLEGED BREACH OR INACCURACY, OF ANY REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT, SHALL BE INDEMNIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE 10 AND THE
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PURCHASE PRICE SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 2.2(b), 2.2(c),
2.2(d), 2.2(e), 3.4, 6.15 AND 9.2. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, SELLER, ON
BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF THE OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, AND  



 

40  PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF THE OTHER PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING RIGHTS OF
CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY TORT OR BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED
UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT), KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, WHICH EXIST OR MAY
ARISE IN THE FUTURE, THAT IT MAY HAVE AGAINST THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES
OR THE PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, AS THE CASE MAY BE, ARISING UNDER OR
BASED UPON ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAW (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LAW RELATING
TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS OR ARISING UNDER OR BASED UPON ANY SECURITIES LAW,
COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE).

42 Section 11.6 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process._  



(a) Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified
Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of
Oklahoma over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action or
proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts.
Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties,
and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection that they may now or hereafter have to the

inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of Seller,
on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties, and
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.



(b) Each of Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller
Indemnified Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other

the content thereof.

upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to

obligations hereunder may be made by either Seller or Purchaser, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other Party hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void. No assignment of any obligations hereunder
shall relieve the Parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.



Section 11.9 _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as

As a result of the simultaneous closing of that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of September 19, 2005 by and between ONEOK, Inc., an
Oklahoma corporation ("ONEOK") and Purchaser, whereby Purchaser will acquire
all of the outstanding capital stock of Seller, Purchaser, Seller and ONEOK
hereby agree that, from and after Closing, all of PurchaserÂ’s and/or CompanyÂ’s
post-Closing payment and performance obligations to Seller under this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of ONEOK, rather than to the benefit of
Seller, and, likewise all of SellerÂ’s post-Closing payment and performance
obligations to Purchaser under this Agreement shall be paid or performed, as
applicable, by ONEOK, rather than by Seller.
