2007, among TRANS MERIDIAN INTERNATIONAL, INC., a British Virgin Islands
company (" _Parent_ "), TME Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("

INTRODUCTION

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have

stock, par value $0.0006 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), at a price
per Share of $3.00, without interest (such price or such higher price as may
be paid for Shares in the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer Price_ ") net to the seller in cash without interest thereon, subject
to any applicable withholding taxes or stock transfer taxes payable;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ")
by unanimous vote of its disinterested members has (i) determined that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the stockholders of the Company, (ii) approved the Offer, (iii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and declared its advisability in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _DGCL_
") and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock
accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub and adopt this Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants contained in
this Agreement and for other valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article 8_ hereof and subject to the conditions set forth in Annex I
hereto (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), as promptly as practicable but in
no event later than the tenth Business Day following the satisfaction of the
condition precedent described in _Section 7.3_ (the " __ _Financing
Condition_ __"), Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the  



 

1  Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "))
the Offer to purchase all outstanding Shares at the Offer Price. The
obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer will be subject only to the Tender Offer Conditions. The
Offer Price shall be net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject
to reduction only for any applicable withholding taxes or stock transfer
taxes payable by the seller. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. As used in
this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " means any day that is not a Saturday,
Sunday or other day on which banks are required or authorized by law to be
closed in New York City, New York.

(b) Merger Sub specifically reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at
any time or from time to time in its sole discretion to waive any condition
of the Offer, to increase the Offer Price and to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the
prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) decrease the
Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii)
decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii)
change or waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I hereto), (iv)
impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions, (v)
extend the expiration of the Offer except as permitted in this _Section
1.1(b)_, or (vi) amend any other term of the Offer in any manner materially
adverse to the holders of Shares. The Offer shall provide for an initial
expiration date (as may be extended as provided in this _Section 1.1(b)_, the
" _Expiration Date_ ") of 20 business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) from the date of commencement of the Offer. Subject to
the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of
all the Tender Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date, Merger Sub
will accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date of the
Offer. Merger Sub shall be entitled (but shall not be obligated) to extend the
Offer, without the consent of the Company, (i) if at the initial Expiration
Date or any extension thereof (including pursuant to the proviso below), any
of the Tender Offer Conditions is not satisfied or waived, (ii) for any period
required by applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or the
American Stock Exchange (" _AMEX_ ") applicable to the Offer, or (iii) for
any period required by applicable law. If all conditions to the Offer have
been satisfied or waived as of any Expiration Date, Merger Sub may, without
the consent of the Company, provide for a subsequent offering period (as
contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act), which subsequent
offering period shall not exceed 20 Business Days. In addition, Merger Sub,
may, without the consent of the Company, increase the Offer Price and extend
the Offer to the extent required by law in connection with such increase. On
or prior to the date(s) that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for
payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Merger Sub the funds necessary to pay for all
Shares that Merger Sub becomes so obligated to accept for payment and pay for
pursuant to the Offer.

(c) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Merger Sub shall file with the SEC (i) a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
with respect to the Offer and (ii) a Rule 13e-3 Transaction Statement on
Schedule 13E-3 (the " _Schedule 13E-3_ "), which shall be filed as part of the
Schedule TO. The Schedule TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an
offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any
related summary  



 

2  advertisement (collectively, together with the Schedule 13E-3 and with all
respective supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to as the "
_Offer Documents"_ ). Merger Sub shall disseminate to holders of Shares the
Offer Documents to the extent required by law. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent or Merger Sub all information concerning the Company
that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in
this Agreement. The Company represents that any such information supplied by
the Company that is included in the Offer Documents will not, at the time
such information is furnished to Parent or Merger Sub, contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and Merger Sub further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to stockholders of the Company, in
each case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub will provide the Company and its
counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of any
oral comments Parent or Merger Sub receives from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and will provide
the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses and
telephonic notification of any oral responses of Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions._

(a) The Company shall file with the SEC and mail to the holders of Shares, on
the date of the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer Documents, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") reflecting the
Company Recommendation (as defined below) and shall disseminate the Schedule
14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Schedule 14D-9 will set forth, and the Company hereby represents, that the
Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i)
determined by unanimous vote of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors that the transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the
Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approved the Offer and the Merger and approved and
adopted this Agreement and declared its advisability in accordance with the
DGCL and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock
tender their shares into the Offer and vote to adopt this Agreement (clauses
(i) through (iii) collectively, the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Recommendations in the
Offer Documents and to the inclusion of copies of the Schedule 14D-9 with the
Offer Documents mailed or otherwise furnished to the Companys stockholders.
The Company further represents that, prior to the execution hereof, Jefferies
and Company, Inc. (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") has delivered to the
Board of Directors of the Company its written opinion that the consideration
to be received for the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair
to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than officers, directors and
other Affiliates (as defined in _Section 1.3(a)_) of the Company; Parent; and
their respective Affiliates)  



 

3  from a financial point of view. The Company further represents and warrants
that it has been authorized by the Company Financial Advisor to permit,
subject to prior review and consent by the Company Financial Advisor (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the inclusion of the fairness
opinion (or a summary thereof) in the Offer Documents and in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company described in this
_Section 1.2(a)_.

(b) The Company represents that the Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable U.S. federal securities laws and,
on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given
to the Companys stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, agree promptly to correct any information provided by either of
them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company,
in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities law. The Company will provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of any oral
comments the Company may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt thereof and will provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel with a copy of any written responses and
telephonic notification of any oral responses of the Company or its counsel.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish Merger Sub
with mailing labels, security position listings, any beneficial owner lists
and any available listing or computer list containing the names and addresses
of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date and
shall furnish Merger Sub with such additional information (including, but not
limited to, updated lists of holders of Shares and their addresses, mailing
labels and lists of security positions and non-objecting beneficial owner
lists) and shall provide such other assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Companys record
and beneficial stockholders.

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable law and to the rights of the holders
of the Companys 20% Junior Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the "
_Junior Preferred Stock_ "), promptly upon the payment by Merger Sub for
Shares pursuant to the Offer and from time to time thereafter, Merger Sub
shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the
product of (x) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the
Company (determined after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by (y) the percentage that the aggregate number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent or its  



 

4  Affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding, and the
Company shall, upon request of Merger Sub, promptly take all actions necessary
to cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected, including, if necessary,
seeking the resignations of one or more existing directors, increasing the
number of authorized directors or amending its bylaws; _provided_ , _however_
, that prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have at least two members who are not officers, directors, employees or
designees of Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
(" _Purchaser Insiders_ "), _provided_ , _further_ , that if the number of
directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to fill such
vacancy with a director who is not a Purchaser Insider. In no event shall
Merger Subs designees be less than a majority of the Board of Directors so
long as Parent and Merger Sub collectively own a majority of the outstanding
Shares. The Company shall also cause the designees of Merger Sub to
constitute the same percentage of representation as is on the Board of
Directors of the Company after giving effect to this _Section 1.3_ on each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, including, if necessary,
seeking the resignations of one or more existing directors, increasing the
number of authorized directors or amending the applicable bylaws. In addition,
promptly upon the payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer and
from time to time thereafter, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate all
members of the board of directors (or equivalent body) and each committee
thereof of each Company Subsidiary. The provisions of this _Section 1.3_
shall not limit any rights that Merger Sub, Parent or any of their Affiliates
may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise. As used in this
Agreement, " _Affiliate_ " means, when used with respect to any Person (as
defined in _Section 3.5_), any other Person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such Person.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Merger Subs designees to the Board
of Directors of the Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to such section and rule in order to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 1.3_ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to
stockholders promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment
thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Merger Sub has
not theretofore designated directors or timely provided the
requisite information) such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under such section and rule in order to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3_. Parent and Merger Sub will
supply any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and
Affiliates required by such section and rule to the Company.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
this _Section 1.3_ and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company
of time for performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, or any waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder will require
the concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office
who are not Purchaser Insiders (or in the case where there are two or fewer
directors who are not Purchaser Insiders, the concurrence of one director who
is not a Purchaser Insider) if such amendment, termination, extension or
waiver would be reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the minority
stockholders of the Company.



 

5 Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the acceptance by Merger Sub of, and
payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer, to purchase that number (but not
less than that number) of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up
Shares_ ") as is equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub and any Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub
taken as a whole, at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share
more than 90% of the total shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the Top-Up
Option be exercisable (x) for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in
excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common
Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock
for purposes of this _Section 1.4_, any shares of Company Common Stock held
in the treasury of the Company), or (y) if the issuance of shares of Company
Common Stock by the Company in connection with the exercise of the Top-
Up Option by Merger Sub would violate applicable rules of the AMEX, (ii)
Merger Sub shall, concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give
written notice to the Company that as promptly as practicable following such
exercise, Merger Sub shall (and Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub to)
consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the Top-Up Option may not be
exercised if any provision of applicable law or any judgment, injunction,
order or decree of any Governmental Authority (as defined in _Section
2.7(d)_) shall prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority or the Companys stockholders in connection with the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Top-Up Shares in respect of such
exercise, which action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action,
filing has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable. Payment by
Merger Sub of the purchase price for the Top-Up Option may be made, at Merger
Subs option, by delivery of (i) immediately available funds by wire transfer
to an account designated by the Company or (B) a demand note issued by Merger
Sub in customary form that is secured by, and has recourse only against, the
stock to be issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option in a principal face amount
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock being purchased
pursuant to the Top-Up Option multiplied by the Offer Price.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the shares of Company Common Stock
that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. Purchaser and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Merger Sub agrees
that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise
thereof will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to
or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning
of the Securities Act.

(f) _Shares of Company Common Stock of Dissenting Stockholders_.

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all of
the shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by holders of Company Common Stock who
shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing an appraisal of the "fair
value" of such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and terminated
and shall cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting Shares other

Offer Price as provided in  _Section 2.6(b)_, upon surrender in the manner
provided in _Section 2.7_, of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock.

such demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Company Common Stock
exercising appraisal rights shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation
out of its own funds.

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Company Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for
the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") to receive in trust the funds to which holders of Company
Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. From time
to time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
make available, to the Paying Agent cash in amounts and at times necessary for
the prompt payment of the Offer Price as provided in _Section 2.6(b)_ upon
surrender of certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock as
provided herein. All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent.



 

9 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ "),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Certificates in exchange for the Offer Price as provided in _Section 2.6(b)_.
Parent will use its reasonable efforts to cause provision to be made for
holders of Company Certificates to procure in person immediately after the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions and to deliver in
person immediately after the Effective Time such letter of transmittal and
Company Certificates in exchange for the Offer Price. Upon surrender of a
Company Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Offer Price, and the Company
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Company Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this  _Section 2.7(b)_, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Offer Price pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Company
Certificate.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_.
All cash paid upon the surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Company Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article 2_.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Company
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Offer Price,
payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the  



 

10  Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Certificates shall
not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any payment
pursuant to this _Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority, the Offer Price in respect of such Company
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. As used in this
Agreement, " _Governmental Authority_ " shall mean any multinational, federal,
provincial, territorial, state, municipal, local, or other governmental or
public department, regulatory or administrative authority, court, commission,
board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, tribunal or judicial or arbitral
body or entity, whether United States or foreign.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company
Certificates evidencing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Offer Price required
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, which shall include
indemnities and the posting of a bond which are acceptable to Parent, of that
fact by the holder thereof with such assurances as the Paying Agent, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Offer Price may
reasonably require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates. 

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer or the Merger any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are
required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law,
including, without limitation, any tax law of the Republic of Kazakhstan. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made.

Section 2.8 _Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time and without any action on the part of any holder of
any outstanding Option (hereinafter defined), whether vested or unvested,
exercisable or unexercisable, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall immediately and fully vest, and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth below in this _Section 2.8_, each such
Option shall terminate and be cancelled at the Effective Time and each holder
of an Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall receive,
in settlement of each Option a Cash Amount. The " _Cash Amount_ " shall be
equal to the net amount of (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price over the exercise price per share of such Option, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Option, less (B) any applicable
withholdings for Taxes. If the exercise price per share of any Option equals
or exceeds the Offer Price, the Cash Amount therefor shall be
zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) payment of the Cash Amount is
subject to written acknowledgement, in a form acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation, that no further payment is due to such holder on account of any
Option and all of such holders rights under such Options have terminated and
(ii) with respect to any person  



 

11  subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, any Cash Amount to be paid to
such person in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ shall be paid as soon as
practicable after the payment can be made without liability to such person
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. As used in this Agreement, " _Option_
" means any option granted, and not exercised, expired or terminated, to a
current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Transmeridian
Exploration Incorporated 2006 Incentive Plan, the 2001 Incentive Stock Option
Plan or the 2003 Stock Compensation Plan (as amended and restated) (" _Company
Stock Plans_ ").

(b) At the Effective Time, all restrictions on the then outstanding shares of
Restricted Stock (as defined below) shall immediately lapse, and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth below, each holder of Restricted Stock will
be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall receive, in settlement of
each share of Restricted Stock, the Offer Price. As used in this Agreement, "
_Restricted Stock_ " means any outstanding award of restricted Company Common
Stock with respect to which the restrictions have not lapsed, and which award
shall not have previously expired or terminated, to a current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of

Company Stock Plan or any other contract or agreement entered into by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 2.8_, all
rights under any Option and any provision of the Company Stock Plans
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any successor thereto shall be cancelled. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, as of
and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 2.8_, no
person shall have any rights under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan,
program or arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof.

(d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall, without cost to the
Company, cause to be effected any necessary amendments to the Company Stock
Plans and any other resolutions, consents or notices, in such form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, required under the Company Stock Plans or any Options
and take any other actions necessary to give effect to the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.8_ and obtain the acknowledgements required
under _Section 2.8(a)_.

(d) The Company Employee Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401
of the Code or other tax-favored treatment under applicable laws do so qualify
and a favorable determination letter or opinion letter to that effect has been
issued by the IRS with respect to each such Company Employee Benefit
Plan, and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Company
Benefit Plans that could cause the loss of such qualification or tax-favored
treatment, or the imposition of any liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA or

any material liability.

payment, (ii) acceleration of the time of any payment, vesting of any payment
or funding of compensation or benefits, (iii) any increase in the amount

, _further_ , that any such disclosure relating to a Takeover Proposal (other
than a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Change in the Company Recommendation (defined below) unless the Board
of Directors of the Company unconditionally reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure; (B) if (under circumstances in which the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this _Section 6.8_ and
prior to the acceptance for purchase of Shares in the Offer) the Company
receives an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal from a third party which did
not result from a breach of this _Section 6.8_ that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company and its representatives may conduct such
additional discussions and provide such information as the Board of Directors
of the Company shall determine, but only if, prior to such provision of such
information or conduct of such additional discussions (1) such third party
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement in customary form that is
no less favorable to the Company, including any standstill provisions included
therein, and no less restrictive than the confidentiality and non-disclosure
provisions of _Section 6.7(b)_ (and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this _Section
6.8_) and (2) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

(b) After commencement of the Offer, the Board of Directors shall not fail to
make, withdraw, recommend or modify in a manner adverse to the Parent or
Merger Sub the Company Recommendation or publicly recommend any Takeover
Proposal or otherwise take any action or make any statement inconsistent with
the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to the acceptance for purchase of Shares in the Offer and subject to the
Companys compliance with its obligations under this  _Section 6.8_, the
Companys Board of Directors may (x) withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, amend, modify or qualify the recommendation,
approval, adoption or declaration of advisability by the Companys Board of
Directors of this Agreement, the Merger or the Company Recommendation
(collectively, a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ ") if the Board of
Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that it is required to do in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (y) recommend, or publicly propose
to recommend any Takeover Proposal, or to the extent permitted pursuant to
and in compliance with _Section 8.1(g)_, to the extent applicable, allow the
Company to enter into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of
subclause (y) above only after the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
Prior to taking any action in accordance with subclause (x) or (y) above, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) given Parent and Merger Sub
at least five Business Days prior written notice that the Companys Board of
Directors intends to take such action (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal
will require a new notification from the Company to Parent and Merger Sub and
a new five Business Day period) and provided Parent and Merger Sub have not,
within such five Business Day period, made a proposal to revise the terms of
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) fully considered any such
response by Parent and Merger Sub and concluded that,  



 

47  notwithstanding such response, such Change in Company Recommendation
continues to be required by fiduciary duty under applicable law. Immediately
upon satisfaction of the Financing Condition, the Company shall cease and
cause to be terminated and shall cause its Affiliates and the Company
Subsidiaries and its or their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents to terminate all then existing discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to,
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
furnished prior to the date that the Financing Condition is satisfied.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub) relating to any direct or indirect (A) acquisition, merger,
consolidation, reorganization, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation,
direct or indirect business combination, asset acquisition or other similar
transaction (including any single or multi-step transaction) involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of (1) assets or businesses that
constitute, represent or generate 10% or more of the total revenue, operating
income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole immediately prior to such transaction, or (2) 10% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other class of capital stock
of the Company or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
any of the Companys Subsidiaries in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) purchase or sale of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 10% or
more of any class of capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and (ii) the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Takeover
Proposal to effect a merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange,
tender offer, recapitalization, liquidation, direct or indirect business
combination, or other similar transaction as a result of which the Companys
stockholders cease to own at least 90% of the voting securities of the
ultimate parent entity resulting from such transaction or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, which in any such case is on
terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel),
taking into account all relevant factors, including any conditions to such
Takeover Proposal, the timing of the closing thereof, the risk of
nonconsummation, the ability of the Person making the Takeover Proposal to
finance the transaction contemplated thereby (which, to the extent financing
is required, must be represented by a bona fide commitment letter in full
force and effect as of the date that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal (but
only if such determination is made after the Financing Condition has been
satisfied)), any required governmental or other consents, filings and
approvals, (A) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the terms of any
proposal by Parent to modify the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) and (B) is reasonably likely to be financed and otherwise
completed without undue delay.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.8(b)_, after the date that
the Financing Condition is satisfied, neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall effect any Change in the Company
Recommendation, or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal. Prior to  



 

48  such date, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof from taking any such action. For
purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company Recommendation shall
include any approval or recommendation (or public proposal to approve or
recommend), by the Board of Directors of the Company of a Takeover Proposal,
or any failure by the Board of Directors of the Company to recommend against
a Takeover Proposal.

(e) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.8_, the Company shall immediately (and in any event, within 24
hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, any
request for information with respect to any such Takeover Proposal, or
any inquiry with respect to or which could result in such a Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal
or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same and shall
immediately provide Parent with a copy of any such written request or
Takeover Proposal or other document relating to such a Takeover Proposal. The
Company will keep Parent promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours) and
fully informed of the status and details (including amendments) of any such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry and shall promptly (and in any event,
within 24 hours) provide Parent with a copy of any non-public information
furnished to the Person making such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who acts as a
fiduciary under any of the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any
other agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been
provided to Parent and are set forth in Section 6.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, including provisions relating to the advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, shall survive the
Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other agreements.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, to the full extent permitted under
the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect as of the date hereof, the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part
out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, and will reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing herein shall impair any rights to indemnification
of any Indemnified Party referred to in _Section 6.9(a)_ above. Promptly
after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.9(b)_ of notice
of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against an Indemnifying Party  



 

49  under this _Section 6.9(b)_, notify the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify an Indemnifying Party
will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified
Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action is brought
against any Indemnified Party and it notifies an Indemnifying Party of the
commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other
Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party (who shall not,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), be counsel to the Indemnifying Party),
and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense thereof (and so long as the Indemnifying Party
satisfies such obligations), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such
Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.9(b)_ for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect
of which any Indemnified Party is or would reasonably be expected to be
or have been a party and indemnity could properly have been sought hereunder
by such Indemnified Party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on any claims that are
the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as
to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf
of an Indemnified Party. In no event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section 6.9(b)_ to pay the fees
and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
single action in any one jurisdiction except to the extent that, in the
opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more of such
Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date
of this Agreement (the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a period of not less than six
years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former
directors or officers and (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or
lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Entity be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 150% (the
" _Maximum Amount_ ") of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance (which the Company represents and warrants to be not more than
$254,756) to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If the
amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
procure and maintain for such six-year period as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause
coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail"
policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Companys
existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of
this _Section 6.9(c)_.



 

50 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this _Section
6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this _Section 6.9_ applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.9_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section
6.9_). 

(e) The foregoing provisions shall not in any way restrict or preclude any
sale, liquidation or dissolution of any Subsidiary (including the Surviving
Entity) of Parent after the Effective Time.

(f) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section
6.9_.

Section 6.10 _State or Foreign Takeover Laws_. If any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
apply to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall promptly, upon the request
of Parent, (i) take all reasonable action to ensure that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) otherwise act to
eliminate the effects of such takeover statute, law or regulation.

Section 6.11 _Expenses_. As used below in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " shall
include all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees
and expenses of outside counsel, accountants, financing sources, investment
bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates)
incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the due
diligence, authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance
of this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement, the solicitation of stockholder approvals, and all other matters
related to the consummation of the Merger (subject to reasonable
documentation). Subject to _Section 8.3_, each party shall bear solely and
entirely, all Expenses that they incur.

Section 6.12 _Preferred Stock_. Promptly upon the request of the Parent (but
in no event prior to the Merger Subs payment for Shares tendered in the
Offer) the Company shall take all actions requested by Parent to redeem
(including payment therefor) the Senior Preferred Stock and the Junior
Preferred Stock in accordance with their respective certificates of
designation.

Section 6.13  _Financing_. Parent will provide the Company with periodic (but
at least weekly) reports regarding the status of the negotiation of the
definitive documentation referred to in _Section 7.3_ (including as to the
status of submission of documents to the proposed lenders, approval by the
lenders and signature of definitive loan documents) and its other efforts  



 

51  pursuant to this _Section 6.13_. In the event that Parent, in its sole
discretion, provides drafts of the definitive documentation for Parents and
Merger Subs financing to the Company, any such drafts and any other written
information made available to the Company relating to such financing shall be
deemed to be furnished for information purposes only and shall be deemed
Information furnished by Parent and therefore subject to the confidentiality
and non-disclosure provisions of _Section 6.7(b)_.

Section 6.14 _Offer for Senior Notes_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, the parties agree that Merger Sub or an Affiliate thereof
may, in Parents sole and absolute discretion, commence an offer to purchase
with respect to all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
senior secured notes due 2010 issued by Transmeridian Exploration Inc. (the "
_Notes_ "), on pricing terms determined by Parent and subject to such other
terms and conditions as are determined by Parent, to be consummated
substantially simultaneously with the payment by Merger Sub for Shares
pursuant to the Offer using funds provided by Parent (the " _Debt Tender
Offer_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Tender
Offer shall be conditioned on the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
this Agreement and payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer. The
Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives to,
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer.

(b) If Parent advises the Company in writing that, in its reasonable judgment
based on the advice of the dealer manager of the Debt Tender Offer, there is
a significant possibility that the Requisite Consent for the Notes will not be
obtained and preparations should be made to defease the Notes, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such preparations, and
if such Requisite Consent is not timely received, the Company, if requested
by Parent, shall defease the Notes in connection with and at the time of the
payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer or at a date subsequent
thereto as requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall
not be required to defease the Notes, provide any irrevocable notice or take
any other irrevocable act regarding such defeasance unless (i) such action is
taken simultaneously with or after the time of the payment by Merger Sub for
Shares pursuant to the Offer and (ii) Parent shall have deposited, or caused
to be deposited, the amount of funds necessary to effect such defeasance as
provided and calculated in accordance with the terms of the indenture
applicable to such Notes. If there is more than one dealer manager for the
Debt Tender Offer, the term dealer manager as used in this _Section 6.14(b)_
shall refer to the lead dealer manager of the Debt Tender Offer.

(c) As part of the Debt Tender Offer for the Notes, Merger Sub or an Affiliate
thereof may solicit the consent (the " _Consent Solicitation_ ") of the
holders of the Notes to certain amendments to the indenture applicable to such
Notes (as heretofore supplemented) as determined by Parent, which amendments
shall be set forth in the Debt Offer Documents (the " _Indenture Amendments_
"), and to obtain, as soon as practicable after the date of the commencement
of the Debt Tender Offers, the requisite consent of holders of the Notes (the
" _Requisite Consent_ ") to authorize the Indenture Amendments. Promptly upon
receipt of the Requisite Consent, the Company shall, shall cause any
applicable Company Subsidiary to, and  



 

52  shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustees to,
execute a supplemental indenture incorporating and giving effect to the
Indenture Amendments, which shall become operative concurrently with the time
of the payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt
Tender Offer).

 

(d) In connection with any Debt Tender Offer, Parent shall prepare all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with such Debt Tender
Offer, including the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal and
other related documents (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ "). Parent
shall cooperate with the Company with respect to the preparation of the Debt
Offer Documents and provide it with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon such documents. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent or
Merger Sub all information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the Debt Offer Documents. The Company represents that any such
information supplied by the Company that is included in the Debt Offer
Documents will not, at the time such information is furnished to Parent or
Merger Sub, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Debt Offer Documents if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Debt Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to holders of the Notes, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to which this Annex is attached, except

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, Merger Sub shall not be

terms of the Merger Agreement, amend the Offer, if (i) there shall not be
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date for
the Offer that number of Shares which, when added to any Shares already owned
by Parent, its Affiliates or their respective subsidiaries, represents at
least a majority of the total number of outstanding Shares on a fully diluted
basis (which shall mean, as of any time, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding, together with all shares of Company Common Stock

warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or securities, convertible or
exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock or otherwise) on the date of

for any Shares any of the following conditions shall exist or have occurred:

enforced, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer by

indirectly: (i) make the acceptance for payment of, or payment for or purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, illegal, or otherwise restrict or prohibit
the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii)
result in a significant delay in or restrict the ability of Merger Sub to
accept for payment, pay for or purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer or to
effect the Merger or make materially more costly the making of the Offer or
the consummation of the Merger, (iii) render Merger Sub unable to accept for
payment or pay for or purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer, (iv) restrain or
prohibit Parents ownership or operation (or that of its Affiliates) of all or
any material portion of the business, assets or products of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (v) impose a limitation on the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub effectively to acquire, hold, transfer or exercise full
rights of ownership of some or all of the Shares, including the right to vote
any Shares acquired or owned by Merger Sub or Parent on an equal basis with
all other Shares on all matters properly presented to the Companys
stockholders, (vi) require Parent or any Affiliate to divest or otherwise hold
separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or take any other
action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any
business, asset or property owned by the Parent or any of its Affiliates or
the Surviving Corporations businesses, assets or properties, or (vii)
otherwise, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect;

Parent, has a reasonable probability of success;

(c) (i) it shall have been publicly disclosed or Merger Sub shall have
otherwise learned that beneficial ownership (determined for the purposes of
this paragraph (c) as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) of 25% or more of the outstanding Shares has been acquired by any Person
other than Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof (A) shall have withdrawn, modified, changed
or qualified (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) its
recommendation, approval, adoption or declaration of advisability, as the case
may be, of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger in any respect adverse to
Parent, (B) shall have approved or recommended to the stockholders of the
Company any Takeover Proposal, or (C) shall have failed to reaffirm publicly
and unconditionally its recommendation to the Companys stockholders that they
tender their Shares in the Offer, which public reaffirmation must be made
within two days after Parents written request to do so (or prior to the
Expiration Date, if earlier), (iii) a third party shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect
to a Takeover Proposal, or (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

provided a written request to the Company pursuant to Section 5 of the

including the appointment or election of a director or directors designated by
the holders of the Junior Preferred to the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof;

(e) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms, or the Company and Merger Sub and Parent shall have reached an
agreement that the Offer or the Merger Agreement be terminated;

(f) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Sections 3.2, 3.11, 3.23 and 3.26 of the Merger Agreement shall not be true
and correct as if such representations and warranties were made at the time of
such determination (except as to any such representation or warranty that
speaks as of a specific date, which must be untrue or incorrect as of
such date); (ii) any of the other representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in the Merger Agreement, when read without any exception or
qualification as to materiality or reference to Company Material Adverse
Effect, shall not be true and correct as if such representations and
warranties were made at the time of such determination (except as to any such
representation and warranty which speaks as of a specific date, which must be
untrue or incorrect as of such date) except where the failure to be so true
and correct would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) the Company shall have
breached or failed to observe or perform in material respects any of its
obligations, covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement;

(g) there shall have occurred, and continued to exist, (i) any general
suspension of, or limitation on prices for, trading in securities on the AMEX,
(ii) a declaration of  



 

ANNEX 1 - Page 2  a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in
the United States, or a material limitation (whether or not mandatory) by
any Governmental Authority on the extension of credit by banks or other
lending institutions or (iii) a declaration of war against a foreign
sovereignty by the United States Congress; or

(h) since the date of this Agreement there shall have occurred any event,
change, effect or development that, individually or when considered together
with any other event, change, effect or development, has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may
be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in their reasonable
discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
