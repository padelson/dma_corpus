entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree

_provided_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the

Shares;  _provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to make available to
the Exchange Agent any Merger Consideration for Dissenting Shares or to the
extent that the Company has made available any amounts in accordance with

Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the

proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may

 



16  reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented
by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the closing of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock nine
(9) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to four (4) years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Authority), any shares of Company Stock represented by
such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.02_,
shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing who is entitled to, and who has demanded, appraisal for
such shares ("Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware
Law ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to perfect
or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. Any such
holder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\.
At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Share that immediately
prior to the Effective Time

 



17  represented Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
the right to appraisal (or had not properly demanded appraisal under Section
262), such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares, withdrawals of such demands
and other instruments served pursuant to Section 262, and Parent shall have
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not (a) make any payment or commitment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands or (b) waive any failure to perfect any right to
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262\.

Section 2.05. _Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) _Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option
to purchase shares of Company Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan
(each, a "Company Stock Option") (whether or not vested and exercisable at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time) that is then outstanding under the
Company Stock Plan shall be treated as follows: (i) where the exercise price
per share under a Company Stock Option is less than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall, automatically and without any action on
behalf of the holder thereof, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each
holder of such Company Stock Option an amount in cash (subject to deduction
for any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.07_), determined by multiplying (A) the excess of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (B) the
number of shares of Company Stock underlying the outstanding portion of such
Company Stock Option had such holder exercised the outstanding Company Stock
Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) where the
exercise price per share under such Company Stock Option equals or exceeds the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without
any payment therefore. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of seven
(7) Business Days prior to, and conditional upon the occurrence of, the
Closing, each holder of an outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option,
whether or not such Company Stock Option is then vested and exercisable,
shall be entitled to exercise such Company Stock Option in full by providing
the Company with a notice of exercise and full payment of the applicable
exercise price in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan and related award agreement. Each such Company Stock Option that is
exercised in accordance with the prior sentence, shall not be entitled to any
payments under this _Section 2.05(a)_ , and any shares of Company Stock
received upon exercise shall instead be subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.02_
hereof.

 

(b) _Restricted Stock._ Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
share of Company Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan which is
subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions ("Company Restricted Stock")
that is then-outstanding shall be treated as follows: (i) each share of
Company Restricted Stock that is time-based shall automatically and without
any action on behalf of the holder thereof become fully vested and the
restrictions thereon shall lapse; and (ii) each share of Company Restricted
Stock the vesting of which is performance-based shall automatically
and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof become fully vested
and the restrictions thereon shall lapse.

 



18 (c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan._ Effective as of the date of
this Agreement, the Board or the compensation committee of the Board will
adopt such resolutions and take such other reasonable actions as may be
reasonably necessary to provide that with respect to the Company Stock
Purchase Plan: (i) participants in the Company Stock Purchase Plan may not
alter their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan), (ii) no participation period will be commenced after the date
of this Agreement, and (iii) each right to purchase shares of Company Stock
(each, a "Company Purchase Right") under the Company Stock Purchase Plan that
is outstanding on the date of this Agreement and remains outstanding after
such time shall be treated as follows: such Company Purchase Right shall
automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof, be
exercised on the Purchase Date (as defined in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan), and (A) if the Purchase Date is on or before the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver shares of Company Stock in accordance with the
terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan (and such shares shall be treated as
other outstanding shares in accordance with this Agreement) and (B) if the
Purchase Date is after the Effective Time, the Company shall pay each holder
of such Company Purchase Right an amount in cash (in lieu of Company Stock)
determined by multiplying (x) the Merger Consideration by (y) the number of
shares of Company Stock that would otherwise have been delivered under such
Company Purchase Right. Any remaining accumulated but unused payroll
deductions shall be distributed to the relevant participants without interest
as soon as administratively practicable following the Purchase Date and the
Company Stock Purchase Plan will terminate at such time.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any resolutions
which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 2.05_ and (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary consents or make any amendments to the terms of any outstanding
Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock, Company Purchase Right and/or
Company Stock Plan or Company Stock Purchase Plan to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and (ii) take all
actions as may be reasonably necessary to terminate all Company Stock Plans
and the Company Stock Purchase Plan as of the Effective Time. All payments
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ shall be made at or as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, pursuant to the Companys ordinary payroll
practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding as set forth
below in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.07_.

 

Section 2.06. _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of Company Stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Stock) shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, stock split or
combination, any stock dividend or distribution thereon with a record date
during such period, or any other similar transaction, but excluding any change
that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to
purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take
any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement,
including _Section_ __ _ 6.01_.

 



19 Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to (i) the
making of such payment under any provision of Tax law and (ii) the disposition
of any Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock or Company Purchase
Right under this Agreement. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds and timely remits such
amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Stock or Company Purchase Right, as the case may be, in respect of which the
Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation
or Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article 2_.

operation of its properties, rights and other assets makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended

1933 Act (together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002) (such documents and any other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC, as have been amended since the time of their filing,
collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing
dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded filing) the Company SEC
Documents (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act or the 1933 Act, as the case may
be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any rules and regulations promulgated

accounting requirements. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company is currently
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC under the

respects in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein or as permitted by the rules
and regulations of the SEC, and (ii) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
times and for the periods referred to therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.06(b)_ , prior to the
date hereof, no executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to
make, without qualification, the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any form, report
or schedule filed by the Company with the SEC since the enactment of the

control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the 1934 Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting. The Company (a) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the 1934 Act) to provide reasonable assurance that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as

 



25  appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (b)
has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board
(and made summaries of such disclosures available to Parent) (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the Companys most recently completed fiscal year, and such assessment
concluded that such control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2015.

the outstanding equity interests of Merger Subsidiary are owned directly by
Parent. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary was formed solely for the purpose
of effecting the Merger and has not engaged in any business activities or
conducted any operations other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



38 Section 5.02. _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action_.
Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary has all necessary corporate power and

by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
and has been adopted by the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Company, is the valid and binding obligation of each of Parent

the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (b) require any

Subsidiary pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, lien, indenture, lease, license, contract or agreement,
or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them or any of their respective material properties,
rights or other assets is bound or (d) violate any Applicable Law applicable
to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, any of their Subsidiaries, or any of their
properties or assets, except in the case of clause (b), (c) or (d), where (x)
any failure to obtain such permissions, authorizations, consents or approvals,
(y) any failure to make such filings or (z) any such modifications,
violations, rights, breaches, defaults, impairments, alterations or rights,

the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent
with respect to statements made therein based on information supplied by the
Company expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 

Section 5.06. _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. Neither Parent nor
Merger Subsidiary is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has it
been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of
Delaware Law (other than as contemplated by this Agreement).

 

Section 5.07. _Finders_ __ _Fees._ Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC ,
whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act
on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the
Company or any of its Affiliates upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.08. _Financing_ _._ __

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company copies of (i) an executed debt
commitment letter and fee letter, including all annexes, exhibits, schedules
and other attachments thereto (in a redacted form removing the fee
information, economic terms of the "market flex" provisions and other economic
provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with merger agreements
of this type, but which redacted information does not relate to the aggregate
amount of commitments under the Financing, the availability of the Financing
or the conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the funding
of the Financing) (together with any other commitment letters with respect to
any Substitute Financing, the "Debt Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA (together with
any other lenders party to any Substitute Financing, the "Debt Financing
Sources") have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,
to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt
Financing") and (ii) an executed equity commitment letter, including all
annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto (the

 



40  "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment Letters,
the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which Sponsor (the "Equity
Financing Source" and, together with the Debt Financing Sources, the
"Financing Sources") have committed to provide equity financing in the
respective amounts, and subject to the terms and conditions, set forth therein
(the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing").

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has
been amended or modified, and the respective commitments contained therein
have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, nor is any such amendment,
modification, withdrawal, rescission or termination currently contemplated or
the subject of current discussions (other than with respect to amendments to
the Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof as permitted under _Section 8.03(a)_ ). As
of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except to the extent
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 

(c) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (including any
"flex" provisions) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Other than the
Financing Commitments, there are no other contracts, arrangements, side
agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral) related to the
aggregate amount of commitments under the Financing, the availability of the
Financing or the conditionality of, or that contain any conditions precedent
to, the funding of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in and
expressly contemplated by the Financing Commitments.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement (i) no event has occurred that (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or
default on the part of Parent, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto under the Financing Commitments and (ii) assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02_
and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions in the Financing
Commitments will fail to be timely satisfied or that the full amount of the
Financing will not be made available to Parent at the Closing.

 

(e) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.

(f) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 4.05_, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and the performance by the
Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Financing Commitments will be sufficient for Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) to pay the
Merger Consideration for all of the shares of Company Stock on a fully-
diluted basis, (ii) to make all payments in respect of the Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Purchase Rights, (iii) to

 



41  repay or refinance all Indebtedness of the Company required to be repaid
hereunder and (iv) to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement
(the "Required Financing Amount").

(g) Parent acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.09. _Solvency._ Assuming (a) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 4 and (b)
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the
Merger, or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of such
conditions, and, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing, the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters and the payment
of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation on a consolidated
basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means that,
as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value"
of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of
all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities",
as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (ii) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

Section 5.10. _Termination Equity Commitment Letter_. Concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement, Sponsor has delivered to the Company the duly
executed Termination Equity Commitment Letter. The Termination Equity
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of the Sponsor, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors rights, general principles of equity and any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and no event has occurred,
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Sponsor under the Termination Equity Commitment
Letter.

 

Section 5.11. _Interest in Competitors_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary nor any of their Affiliates own any
interest in any Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from
products, services or lines of business within the geographic areas where the
Company provides its principal products or services.

 



42 Section 5.12. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Sponsor, nor any of their respective
Affiliates has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), pursuant to which: (a) any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration, or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or agrees to vote against any Superior
Proposal, (b) any Person (other than Sponsor, or any of their respective
Affiliates or limited partners) has agreed to provide, directly or
indirectly, equity capital to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in
part the Merger or (c) any Company Employee has agreed to (x) remain as an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (other than pursuant to any employment contracts with the Company and its
Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof), (y) contribute or roll-over any
portion of such employees Company Stock, Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock, or other equity awards to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Parent of any of its Affiliates or (z) receive any capital
stock or equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent
or its Affiliates.

 

Section 5.13. _Vote/Approval Required._ No vote or consent of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Parent is necessary to adopt
this Agreement or approve the Merger. The adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger by Parent in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Subsidiary is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary necessary to adopt this Agreement
or approve the Merger.

 

Section 5.14. _Investigation; No Reliance_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
each acknowledge and agree that it (a) has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of, and has had an opportunity to discuss and ask
questions regarding, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
management of the Company, (b) has had access to the books and records of the
Company, the "data room" maintained by the Company for purposes of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such other information as it
has desired or requested to review and (c) has conducted its own independent
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any representation or warranty by
any Person regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as expressly
set forth in _Article 4_ , including any implied warranty or representation as
to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose
or trade as to any of the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Such representations and warranties by the Company constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
understands, acknowledges, and agrees that: (i) all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied (including, but not
limited to, any relating to the future or historical financial conditions,
results of operations, assets or liabilities or prospects of the Company and
its Subsidiaries) are specifically disclaimed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary;
and (ii) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make
any representations or warranties relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries
or the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and, if made, such 

 



43  representation or warranty may not be relied upon by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary as having been authorized by the Company and shall not be deemed to
have been made by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is understood that any cost estimates, financial or other
projections or other predictions that may be contained or referred to in the
Company Disclosure Letter or elsewhere, as well as any information, documents
or other materials (including any such materials contained in the "data room")
or management presentations that have been or shall hereafter be provided to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary are not and will not be deemed to
be representations or warranties of the Company, and no representation or
warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing
except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
understands and agrees that any inventory, equipment, vehicles, assets,
properties and business of the Company and its Subsidiaries are furnished "as
is", "where is" and, subject only to the representations and warranties
contained in _Article 4_ , with all faults and without other representation or

Parent and its Representatives shall not be permitted to perform any invasive
or destructive environmental sampling at any owned or leased real property,
including sampling of soil, groundwater, surface water, building materials,

hold, all information received from the other party, directly or indirectly,
in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject
to, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the definition of "Representatives" in the first
paragraph of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to include any
potential debt or equity financing source of Parent or Merger Subsidiary (it
being understood that notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective
Representatives may disclose any information to prospective debt and equity
financing sources in connection with the syndication and marketing of the
Financing subject to receipt of customary confidentiality undertakings from
such prospective debt and equity financing sources) and (ii) the second and
sixth paragraphs of Section 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement and the
restrictions set forth in Section 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
inapplicable with respect to any of the transactions set forth in this
Agreement or any proposals, negotiations or arrangements by or on behalf of a
party permitted by this Agreement (including in response to a notice pursuant
to _Section 6.03(f)_ ).

 

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if

reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party (except to notify such Person
as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section 6.03(a)_ ), and (ii)

encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of

or has made, or could reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal,
or (C) enter into any letter of intent or other agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
permitted under _Section 6.03(b)_ ) with any Third Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the parties understand and agree that the Company may waive in connection with
entering into this Agreement any provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof is a party that prohibits the counterparty
thereto from confidentially requesting the Company to amend or waive the
standstill provision in such agreement ( _i.e._ , a "dont ask to waive"
provision) to the extent the Board determines that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the

 



48  restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence of this _Section 6.03(a)_
by any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this _Section 6.03(a)_ by the Company. The Company agrees that it will
promptly request any Third Party that has executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to promptly
return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Third Party
or its representatives prior to the date hereof and shall terminate access to
data rooms furnished in connection therewith.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 6.03(a)_ to the
contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
(i) the Company or any of its Representatives has received a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.03(a)_
(it being understood that the Company and its Representatives may contact the
Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof) and that the Board reasonably believes, in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the
Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A) engage in
negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives,
and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any such information that is provided to any such
Person which was not previously provided to or made available to Parent.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall be deemed to
prohibit the Company or the Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state law or other Applicable Laws,
including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or from making any legally
required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that
neither the Company nor its Board may recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless permitted by _Section 6.03(f)_ ,
(ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act or (iii)
contacting and engaging in discussions with any Person or group and their
respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ solely for the purpose of
clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof.

 

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within
forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering
making, or has made or could be reasonably expected to make, an
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, offer or proposal or indication or request and, if
applicable, copies of any proposed agreements and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any

 



49  event within forty-eight (48) hours), of any material developments regarding
any Acquisition Proposal or any material change to the terms and status of any
such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) Except as provided in _Section 6.03(f)_ , the Board shall not (i)
withdraw or withhold, or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or publicly announce that it has proposed or
resolved to take such action, (ii) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) in the event any tender or
exchange offer is commenced that would constitute an Acquisition Proposal,
fail to publish, send or provide to the Company stockholders, pursuant to Rule
14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act and within ten (10) Business Days after such
tender or exchange offer is first commenced, or subsequently amended in any
material respect, a statement recommending that the Company stockholders
reject such tender or exchange offer and publicly affirming the Company Board
Recommendation or (iv) recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, or publicly
propose or resolve to recommend, adopt, approve or enter into, any Acquisition
Proposal or any letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement (any of actions in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"). No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the
approval of the Board for purposes of causing any laws of the type referred
to in _Section_ __ _ 4.23_ to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board may (i) (x)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of an Acquisition Proposal,
or (y) enter into an agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, if (A) the Company shall have received an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(B) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take action with respect to such Superior
Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, (C) the Company has provided four (4) Business
Days prior written notice to Parent that it intends to take such action (a
"Section 6.03 Notice") (and such period (which shall commence on the first
Business Day immediately following the day on which the Section 6.03 Notice
is received by Parent), the "Notice Period"), (D) if Parent shall have
delivered to the Company a written offer capable of being accepted by the
Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during the Notice
Period, the Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors), after considering the terms
of such offer by Parent, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such
_Section_ __ _ 6.03_ Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal, and (E) in
the case of clause (y) above, the Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ , or (ii) in response to any event,
fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that is material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by, the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, which
event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to the
Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and does not
involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal, effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change if (A) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, (B) the Company has previously delivered to Parent a
Section 6.03 Notice that it intends to take such action, and (C) if Parent
shall have delivered to the Company a

 



50  written offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement during the Notice Period, the Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the failure to
effect such Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. If any Superior
Proposal that is the subject of clause (i) of this _Section 6.03(f)_ is
revised, including any revision to price, then the Company shall deliver to
Parent a new Section 6.03 Notice and again comply with the requirements of
clause (i) of this _Section 6.03(f)_ with respect to such revised Superior
Proposal, on each occasion on which a revised Superior Proposal is submitted,
_provided_ , that in connection with each new Section 6.03 Notice
contemplated by this sentence, each reference to a four (4) Business Day
period in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a reference to three
(3) Business Day notice period (it being understood and agreed that in no
event shall such additional three (3) Business Day notice period be deemed to
shorten the initial four (4) Business Day notice period). If requested by
Parent, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, all information
provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ will be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

agreement (i) in effect on the date hereof or (ii) that contains provisions
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which does not prohibit
the Company from complying with its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that
such confidentiality agreement need not restrict a Third Party from making
directly to the Company or the Board, or consummating the transactions
contemplated by, an Acquisition Proposal.

(B) "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
(with all of the percentages included in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) that was not solicited or received
in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, that is reasonably likely to be
consummated and that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), considering such
factors as the Board considers to be appropriate (which shall in any event
include the legal, financial, regulatory and fiduciary aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal, and the Persons making such Acquisition Proposal or
providing financing for such Acquisition Proposal), to be more favorable from
a financial point of view to the Company stockholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any offer by Parent, in accordance
with _Section 6.03(f)_ , to modify the terms hereof).

 

Section 6.04. _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to

under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

 



51 Section 6.05. _Transaction Litigation_ _._ The Company shall as promptly

Litigation") and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof, including by facilitating meetings between counsel of the
Company and counsel of Parent and as promptly as reasonably practicable and
diligently responding to inquiries with respect to any Transaction Litigation
made by Parent or its counsel. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense, settlement or compromise of any Transaction
Litigation (including providing Parent the opportunity to review and comment
on proposed additional disclosure in the Proxy Statement). The Company shall
not settle or compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction
Litigation without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this _Section_
__ _ 6.06_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
litigation and the Company will consult with Parent regarding the defense,
settlement or compromise of any Transaction Litigation and consider Parents
views with respect to any Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected).

 

Section 6.06. _Stock Exchange De-listing_ _; 1934 Act Deregistration_ _._
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation
to Parent and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and
policies of NASDAQ and the SEC to enable the de-listing by the Surviving
Corporation of the common stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the
Company Stock under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in

against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at

(a) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits._ During the period
beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Effective Time or, if shorter, during the period of
employment of a Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, Parent shall
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to, provide or cause to be provided to each Company Employee who is employed

use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) ensure that no waiting periods,
exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing conditions,

or beneficiaries may be eligible to participate following the Closing; and
(ii) provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred
previously by Continuing Employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries)
during any plan year in which such Continuing Employees (and their dependents
or beneficiaries) commence participation under any other welfare plans shall
be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deducible, co-
payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of- pocket provisions and like adjustments
or limitations on coverage under any such other welfare benefit plans for
which participation commences during any plan year.

(d) _Credited Service_. Parent shall grant, or cause to be granted to, all

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 

Section 8.01. _Regulatory Undertakings._

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cooperate with
each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under any Applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, clearances,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made
by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
or avoid any Legal Proceeding by any Governmental Authority (including,
without limitation, those in connection with the Required Governmental
Approvals), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including those contemplated with respect to the Financing, (iii)
as promptly as is reasonably practicable but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days from the date hereof (other than those set forth on

 



56   _Section 1.01(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter which shall be made
within 30 days from the date hereof and the Team Telecom Agencies and CFIUS
filings) make or cause to be made the applications or filings required to be
made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company under or with respect to the Required Governmental Approvals or any
other Applicable Laws in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, and pay any
fees due in connection with such applications or filings, (iv) comply at the
earliest reasonably practicable date with any request under or with respect
to the Required Governmental Approvals and any such other Applicable Laws for
additional information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the
Company from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the FCC,
CFIUS, the Team Telecom Agencies or any other Governmental Authority in
connection with such applications or filings or the Merger, (v) defend any
Legal Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
and (vi) coordinate and cooperate with, and give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in
connection with, making (A) any filing under or with respect to the Required
Governmental Approvals or any such other Applicable Laws and (B) any filings,
conferences or other submissions related to resolving any investigation or
other inquiry by any Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, furnish to the other party all information necessary
(including, but not limited to, information about or from their respective
direct or indirect owners) for any such application or other filing to be made
in connection with the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly
inform the other of any material communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such application or filing. If a party hereto intends to
independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such party
shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting and invite
representatives of the other party to participate in the meeting with the
Governmental Authority unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority. The
parties shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in
connection with all meetings and Legal Proceedings under or relating to any
such application or filing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (I) Parent agrees to take any and all actions and to make any and
all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Applicable Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
(including, without limitation, those in connection with the Required
Governmental Approvals) with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than the
End Date), provided that nothing in this Section 8.01 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall require Parent to (i) take or agree to take any action with
respect to (A) any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or
its Subsidiaries) or any direct or indirect portfolio companies of investment
funds advised or managed by one or more Affiliates of Parent or any investment
funds advised or managed by one or more Affiliates of Parent, including
selling, divesting, conveying, holding separate, or otherwise limiting its
freedom of action with respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses,
businesses, operations, or interest therein, of any such Affiliates or any
direct or indirect portfolio companies of investment funds advised or managed
by one or more Affiliates of Parent or any investment funds advised or managed
by one or more Affiliates of Parent or (B) the selling, divesting, conveying
or holding 

 



57  separate with respect to any assets, rights, products, licenses, businesses,
operations, or interest therein, of the Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in more than a _de minimis_ respect or (ii) be required to
accept or agree to a Burdensome Condition, and (II) the obligations set forth
in this Section 8.01 shall not be deemed to have been breached as a result of
actions by the Company or its Subsidiaries permitted by Section 6.03. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Burdensome Condition" means any actions or
undertakings necessary to obtain the approval of CFIUS, the Team Telecom
Agencies or any other Governmental Agency that, pursuant to a mitigation
agreement or otherwise, would impose requirements on the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or their assets and businesses) that individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect in any
material respect on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being agreed that any such
actions or undertakings that are substantially similar to the terms of
mitigation agreements previously entered into by Parents Affiliates with
CFIUS and Team Telecom Agencies with respect to their acquisition of Tampnet
would not be a Burdensome Condition).

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable efforts to obtain any consents
under any Company Material Agreements necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent
shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, notices,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be given or obtained, or should
be given or obtained, from parties to any Company Material Agreements
in connection with consummation of the Merger and in seeking any such
actions, notices, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent and
the Company shall promptly notify each other in writing of any pending or
threatened Legal Proceedings (i) challenging or seeking material damages in
connection with the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise limit in any material respect the
right of Parent to own or operate all or any portion of the businesses or
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(d) If any Legal Proceeding is instituted by a Governmental Authority
challenging the Merger as violative of any Applicable Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist, except
insofar as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree, any such
Legal Proceeding, including any Legal Proceeding that seeks a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or
restrict consummation of the Merger.

 

(e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other with respect to
all matters relating to any Governmental Authority in a manner consistent
with their obligations in this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ relating to any
regulatory, governmental, CFIUS or Team Telecom Agencies matters including
devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary
regulatory, governmental, CFIUS or Team Telecom Agencies approvals or
clearances. The Company and Parent shall both, to the extent practicable (i)
have the opportunity to participate in all meetings (in person or via
telephone or video conference) with, (ii) review communications to, and (iii)

 



58  receive copies of communications from, any Governmental Authority in
connection with obtaining any necessary regulatory, governmental, CFIUS or
Team Telecom Agencies clearances, in each case, in a manner consistent with
their obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_, materials provided to the other party or its counsel
may be redacted to the extent necessary to address reasonable privilege and
confidentiality concerns.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision
over its business operations.

 

Section 8.02. _Proxy Statement._

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably possible following the date hereof, (i) the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (ii) the
Company shall cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting") to be duly called and held for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting (with a record date and
meeting date to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent) on a
date as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof for the
purpose of (i) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and shall take all
lawful action to solicit the approval of this Agreement by such stockholders
and (ii) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and
the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a
proposal to the stockholders of the Company for a non-binding advisory vote to
approve certain compensation that may become payable to the Companys named
executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger. Once
established, the Company shall not change the record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent or as required
by Applicable Law. Except to the extent the Company has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.03(f)_ , the Board shall
make the Company Board Recommendation and shall include such Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and the Board and all committees
thereof shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to
withdraw or modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent such
recommendation, or (ii) take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting inconsistent with
such recommendation.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and in taking such actions or
making any such filings required in connection with the Proxy Statement. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information (including financial
information) as may be reasonably requested by the other that is customarily
included in a proxy statement prepared in connection with a transaction of the
type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise required by the SEC or
Applicable Law, in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Proxy Statement, including in response to any
comments from the SEC.

 



59 (d) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (and any amendments or
supplements thereto or any related correspondence) each time before it is
filed with the SEC and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (with the
reasonable assistance of Parent) to promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(e) The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as
promptly as reasonably possible after the date the SEC staff advises that it
has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the
Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by Parent which is required to be set forth in a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company.

 

(f) Without limiting the Companys rights under _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ , (i)
the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders
on the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not
be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal), or by an Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any
case in which the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 6.03(f)_ , the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to a
vote of its stockholders; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated
to recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to the extent that the Board makes an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments (taking
into account related "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters) (or such other terms and conditions acceptable to Parent
so long as such terms and conditions satisfy the requirement set forth in
_Section 8.03(b)(ii)_ below) and to consummate the Financing on the Closing
Date and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy, under the Financing Commitments without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or
waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including,
without limitation, by increasing the fees payable thereunder or the original
issue discount applicable to the Financing) below the Required Financing
Amount, (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing that would prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) materially delay or impair the availability of the Financing
at Closing or materially impede the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Subsidiary to enforce its rights against the other parties
(collectively, each a "Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment"); _provided_
, that, subject to the foregoing, Parent may amend the Financing Commitments
without the consent of the Company to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Financing Commitments as of the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect
the Financing Commitments, (B) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account
the Marketing Period) all conditions to obtaining the Financing that are
within its control or subject to its influence, (C) enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing Commitments on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (taking into account related

conditions satisfy the requirement set forth in _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_ below),

commitment fees or other fees required to be paid under the Financing
Commitments on or prior to the Closing Date, (E) enforce its rights under the

Financing Commitments have been satisfied, consummate the Financing on or
before the Closing Date. Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the
Financing Commitments in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, Parent
shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and, so long as no such
amendment, supplement or modification does not constitute a Restricted
Financing Commitment Amendment, the terms "Debt Commitment Letters", "Equity
Commitment Letters" and "Financing Sources" shall mean the Debt Commitment
Letters, Equity Commitment Letters and Financing Sources, as so amended,
supplemented or modified.

 

(b) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Financing Commitments, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth
therein (taking into account related "market flex" provisions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letters), Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event (i) notify the Company in writing thereof, (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing (on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable (taking into account related "market
flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters) to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, than the terms and conditions as set

 



61  forth in the Financing Commitments (taking into account any "market flex"
provisions with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters) in an amount, when
added to the portion of the Financing Commitments that is still available,
that is no less than the Required Financing Amount (the "Substitute
Financing") and (iii) promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company
true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and fee letter
with respect to such Substitute Financing (in a redacted form removing fee
information, economic terms of the "market flex" provisions and other economic
provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with merger agreements
of this type, but which redacted information does not relate to the aggregate
amount of commitments under the Financing, the availability of the Financing
or the conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the funding
of the Substitute Financing) and related definitive financing documents with
respect to such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any
such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter and fee letter for such Substitute
Financing shall be deemed the "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt notice (i)
of any material breach or material default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any material breach or material default) by any party
to any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing;
(ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any Debt Financing Sources with respect to any actual or threatened material
breach, material default, withdrawal, early termination or repudiation by any
Debt Financing Sources of any provisions of the Financing Commitments or any
definitive document related to the Financing that would, in any such case,
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timely availability (taking
into account the timing of the Marketing Period) or the amount of the
Financing Commitments; (iii) of any amendment or modification of, or waiver
under, the Financing Commitments or any related fee letters, (iv) of any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Financing Commitments (other than customary negotiations in the ordinary
course between or among any parties to the Financing Commitments with respect
to the definitive documentation for the Financing) and (v) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in good faith that there is a reasonable
possibility that it will not be able to timely obtain (taking into account the
timing of the Marketing Period) all or any portion of the Financing;
_provided_ , that in no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose
any information pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or Substitute Financing obtained in accordance with _Section
8.03(b)_ ).

(d) Nothing contained elsewhere in this Section 8.03 shall require, and in
no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to
require, Parent to pay any fees or agree to pay any interest rate amounts, in
either case, in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments
(taking into account any "market flex" provisions with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letters) or to consummate the Debt Financing prior to the
completion of the Marketing Period.

TERMINATION

 

Section 10.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval ( _provided_ ,
that any termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(i)_ or _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ may only occur prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval):

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before November 18, 2017
(such date, as it may be extended in accordance with the provisos below, the
"End Date"); _provided_ , that (A) each of Parent and the Company shall have
the right, in its respective sole discretion, to further extend the End Date
to a date not beyond February 18, 2018 if the condition set forth in _Section
9.01(c)_ (or, with respect to the matters addressed in such Section, _Section
9.01(b)_ ) has not been satisfied or waived on or prior to such date, but all
other conditions set forth in _Article 9_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing and that would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have
occurred on the End Date) by delivering notice of such extension to the other
party not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date, and Parent
will seek an extension of the Debt Commitment Letters to February 18, 2018 on
terms not less favorable to Parent, in any material respect, than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ , that, (I) if the Debt
Commitment Letters are extended for a period ending earlier than February 18,
2018, the End Date may only be extended for such shorter period of time and
(II) if the Debt Commitment Letters are not extended for any period, the End
Date will remain November 18, 2017 and (B) neither (I) the right to extend the
End Date pursuant to this  _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ nor (II) the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ shall be
available to any party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated
on or before the End Date was due to the breach of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Parent nor
Merger Subsidiary shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement for
purposes of this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ solely as a result of the inability of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the date the Closing was required to occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01_ due to the proceeds of the Debt Financing not being
available in full pursuant to the terms thereof; _provided, further,_ that the
foregoing shall not impact Parents obligation to pay the Parent Termination
Fee, if due, pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)(iv)_ );

 



69 (ii) there shall be any permanent injunction or other order issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition
preventing the consummation of the Merger and such injunction or other order,
restraint or prohibition shall have become final and nonappealable;
_ provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01(b)(ii) will not be available to a party if the injunction,
order, restraint or other prohibition being issued resulted from the breach of
any of such partys representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ ;
or

 

(iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any subsequent meeting
following an adjournment or postponement thereof) at which a vote to adopt
the Agreement is taken, the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or

(i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in _Section
9.02(a)_ ,or _Section 9.02(b)_ not to be satisfied and to be incapable of
being satisfied by the End Date, except that, if such breach is curable by
the Company through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, until
the earlier of (x) three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date and (y)
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of notice from Parent of such
breach, but only as long as Company continues to use its reasonable best
efforts to cure such breach (the "Company Cure Period"), such termination
shall become effective only if the breach is not cured within the Company
Cure Period; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_ if it is then in breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or _Section_ __ _
9.03_; or

 

(d) by the Company, if:

 

(i) the Board authorizes the Company to enter into a written agreement
concerning a Superior Proposal and the Company enters into such agreement
substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ , _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ if
it has not complied in all material respects with _Section_ __ _ 6.03_;

 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth
in _Section_

 



70   _9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ not to be satisfied and to be incapable of
being satisfied by the End Date, except that, if such breach is curable by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary through the exercise of its reasonable best
efforts, then, until the earlier of (x) three (3) Business Days prior to the
End Date and (y) thirty (30) days after receipt by Parent of notice from the
Company of such breach, but only as long as Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as
applicable, continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach
(the "Parent Cure Period"), such termination shall become effective only if
the breach is not cured within the Parent Cure Period; _provided_ , that, the
Parent Cure Period shall not be applicable to any breach or failure to perform
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary that gives rise to a termination right under
_Section 10.01(d)(iii)_ below; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01(d)(ii)_ if it is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement and
such breach would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __
_ 9.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.02_; or

 

(iii) (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, each of which would have been satisfied if the
Closing were to have occurred on the date of termination), (B) the Company has
given written notice on or after the date on which the Closing should have

that it is prepared, willing and able to consummate the Closing and will

Notice") and (C) Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date that the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and fail to
consummate the Closing by the close of business on the second Business Day
following receipt of the Satisfaction Notice.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_ ) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect without liability of any party (or any member of the Company Group or
the Parent Group) to the other party hereto, except that (a) the
Confidentiality Agreement (to the extent set forth therein), the Termination
Equity Commitment Letter (to the extent set forth therein) and the provisions
of _Section 8.03(f)_ (to the extent provided for therein), this  _Section_ __
_ 10.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, _Section_ __ _ 11.04_, _Section

pay the amounts due pursuant to _Section 11.04(c)_ , and, in order to obtain

further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (B) neither Parent nor any other member of

thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and (C) Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Legal Proceedings pending
in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in

Company, its Subsidiaries or any member of the Company Group, to be dismissed

avoidance of doubt, other than in connection with a Willful Breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in
this Agreement (but excluding circumstances where the Company Termination Fee
is payable in accordance with _Section 11.04(b)_ , (x) the amounts Parent and
Merger Subsidiary are entitled to collect, if due, are those specified in
clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 11.04(e)_ are intended to serve as a
cap on the maximum aggregate liability of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
any member of the Company Group under this Agreement in the

 



75  event the Company fails to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.01_ of this Agreement or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to
perform hereunder and under no circumstances shall Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or any other member of the Parent Group or any Debt Financing Sources Related

event Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to effect the Closing in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ of this Agreement or otherwise breach this

11.13_, the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any member of the Parent Group or any
Debt Financing Sources Related Party in respect of this Agreement, any
contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including the Debt
Commitment Letters, Equity Commitment Letters and the Termination
Equity Commitment Letter, but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement) and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article 10_ and collect, if due, (i) the
Parent Termination Fee, and (ii) any interest and other amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 11.04(d)_ and, except in connection with an order of
specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_, (A) no member of the Parent Group or any Debt
Financing Sources Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any contract or agreement
executed in connection herewith (including the Debt Commitment Letters,
Equity Commitment Letters and the Termination Equity Commitment Letter, but
excluding the Confidentiality Agreement) or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (B) neither the Company nor any other member
of the Company Group shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal
Proceeding against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other member of the Parent

basis for such termination, and (C) the Company shall use its reasonable best

extent maintained by the Company or another member of the Company Group
against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other member of the Parent Group or
any Debt Financing Sources Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice
promptly following the payment of any such amounts. For the avoidance of
doubt, (x) the amounts the Company is entitled to collect, if due, as
specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 11.04(f)_  are intended to
serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and any member of the Parent Group

 



76  under this Agreement in the event Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to
effect the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ of this Agreement
or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder and under no
circumstances shall the Company be entitled to collect, if due, more than the
amounts specified in such clauses or to collect, if due, any such amounts
including the Parent Termination Fee, on more than one occasion and (y) under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the obligation to close contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_ and any money damages, including all or any portion of
the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
unless and until the Closing has occurred, the Company hereby waives any and
all rights and claims against any Debt Financing Sources Related Parties in
connection with this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , that the foregoing
waiver and release shall not apply to any rights, claims or causes of action
that the Company or any of its affiliates or other equity holders may have
against the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties (a) in their capacity as an
agent, lender, swingline lender or issuing bank under the Company
Credit Agreement, or (b) for breach of any nondisclosure agreement that any
Debt Financing Sources Related Party may have entered into with the Company or
its affiliates. The Debt Financing Sources Related Parties are express third
party beneficiaries of the provisions of this _Section 11.04(f)_ , may
enforce this _Section 11.04(f)_ directly, and this _Section 11.04(f)_ may not
be amended, modified or supplemented in a manner materially adverse to them by
the parties hereto without the prior express written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Letters._  The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that are contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty or covenant shall not be deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, other

inure to the benefit of the persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, (iii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of the
holders of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock to receive the
payments contemplated by the

 



77  applicable provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, in each case, at the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and (iv) the provisions of  _Section 11.04(e)_ and _Section 11.04(f)_ shall

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 11.06(a)_ , (i) the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties are beneficiaries of any liability cap or other limitation on
remedies or damages in this Agreement that are for the benefit of Parent,
including, without limitation, those set forth in _Section 11.04(f)_ and (ii)
the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties are express third party
beneficiaries of the provisions of _Section 11.03(a)_ , _Section 11.04(f)_ ,
_Section_ __ _ 11.07_, _Section 11.08(b)_ and this _Section 11.06(b)_ and may
enforce such Sections directly, and such Sections may not be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties hereto in a manner materially adverse
to them without the express written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 

(c) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto.

(d) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto.

 

Section 11.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state; _provided_ , that the Debt
Financing and all actions (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to the Debt Financing, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of any documentation (including the Debt Commitment
Letters) in connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except as
expressly specified otherwise in the Debt Commitment Letters or in any
definitive document related to such financing).

 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction._

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection
with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought
by any member of the Company Group, the Parent Group or any Debt Financing
Sources Related Party, or against any member of the Company Group, the Parent
Group or any Debt Financing Sources Related Party) shall be brought in the
Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such court or that any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

 



78 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 11.08(a)_ , each party hereto
hereby irrevocably agrees (i) that any dispute, claim or controversy of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing and the transactions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, any related fee letter and
engagement letter or the performance of services thereunder shall be subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York state or federal court sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its
Affiliates to bring or support any other Person in bringing any such dispute,
claim or controversy of any kind or description in any other court, and (iii)
to waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any such dispute, claim or
controversy of any kind or description. The Debt Financing Sources and their
respective Affiliates are express third party beneficiaries of the provisions
of this _Section 11.08(b)_ , may enforce this _Section 11.08(b)_  directly,
and this _Section 11.08(b)_ may not be amended, modified or supplemented by
the parties hereto without the prior express written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

 

(c) EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
DESIGNATE CORPORATION SERVICE COMPANY, WITH AN OFFICE AT 2711 CENTERVILLE
ROAD, SUITE 400, WILMINGTON, NEW CASTLE COUNTY, DELAWARE, (IN SUCH CAPACITY,
THE "PROCESS AGENT"), WITH AN OFFICE AT 1209 ORANGE STREET, CITY OF
WILMINGTON, COUNTY OF NEW CASTLE, DELAWARE 19801 AS ITS DESIGNEE, APPOINTEE
AND AGENT TO RECEIVE, FOR AND ON ITS BEHALF SERVICE OF PROCESS IN SUCH
JURISDICTION IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND
SUCH SERVICE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETE UPON DELIVERY THEREOF TO THE PROCESS
AGENT; _PROVIDED_ , THAT IN THE CASE OF ANY SUCH SERVICE UPON THE PROCESS
AGENT, THE PARTY EFFECTING SUCH SERVICE SHALL ALSO DELIVER A COPY THEREOF TO
EACH OTHER SUCH PARTY IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 11.01_ OF THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY SHALL TAKE ALL SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO
CONTINUE SAID APPOINTMENT IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OR TO APPOINT ANOTHER AGENT
SO THAT SUCH PARTY WILL AT ALL TIMES HAVE AN AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR
THE ABOVE PURPOSES IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE
RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE
IRREVOCABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

 

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE DEBT FINANCING).

 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all 

 



79  of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

 

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Termination Equity
Commitment Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

Section 11.12. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties intend for the remedies and limitations thereon contained in
_Section_ __ _ 11.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ to be construed as integral
provisions of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not
be severable in any manner that increases a partys liability or obligations
hereunder or under the Financing.

 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance._

 

(a) Subject to the provisions set forth in _Section 11.13(b)_ , the parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof (and, more
specifically, that irreparable damage would occur if the Merger were not
consummated and the Companys stockholders and holders of Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock did not receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms but subject to the conditions of
this Agreement) and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the
parties obligations under _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger and Parents obligation to pay, and the
Companys stockholders the holders of Company Stock Options and the holders
of the Company Restricted Stocks right to receive, the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger, subject in each case to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement) in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties further waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or proof of actual
damages in connection with any such remedy.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 11.13(a)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in
accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter

 



80 and to cause Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur at the Closing,
including by demanding Parent to fully enforce the Sponsors obligations under
the Equity Commitment Letter and Parents rights thereunder, if, and only if,
(i) all of the conditions in  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02_
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date, but each of which conditions shall be capable of being
satisfied upon the Closing Date) have been satisfied by, and remain satisfied
on, the date the Closing is required to have occurred and no event shall have
occurred nor shall any condition exist that would cause any of the conditions
in  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ to fail to be satisfied,
(ii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to complete the Closing on the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01_,
(iii) the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters has been
funded or the Debt Financing Sources have confirmed that the Debt Financing
will be funded at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing
that it is ready, willing and able for the Closing to occur if specific
performance is granted and that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing will occur.

(c) Each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided herein, subject to the limitation in _Section
11.13(b)_ , including objections on the basis that (i) either party has an
adequate remedy at law or equity or (ii) an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. Until such time as Parent pays the Parent Termination
Fee, the remedies available to the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.13_ shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)_. The parties hereto further
agree that nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ shall require any
party hereto to institute any proceeding for specific performance under this
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_ prior to or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article 10_ (and/or receipt of any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)_ ), nor shall the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ or anything set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 10_. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that while the parties may
pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 11.13_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee or
Parent Termination Fee under no circumstances shall a party be permitted or
entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance to require a
party to consummate the Closing and (B) payment of the Company Termination Fee
or Parent Termination Fee.
