WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the terms
and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Merger
Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as

outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of Company Common
Stock of $25.50 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to

withholding of Taxes, net to the seller thereof in cash, without
interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set
forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock

contemplated by this Agreement, the " _Transactions_ "), in accordance with
the DGCL, whereby each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously approved and
declared advisable, and the board of directors of Parent has unanimously
approved, this Agreement and the Transactions, and the sole stockholder of

into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of the Company, are entering into Support
Agreements with Parent (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and, collectively,
the " _Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the signatories thereto are
agreeing to, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements, tender
their Company Common Stock into the Offer and to take (and refrain from
taking) certain other actions in connection with the transactions contemplated

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, commence,
within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the
Offer prior to April 14, 2015. As promptly as reasonably practicable on or
after such date (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days after such
date), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth
in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall initially expire at
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date twenty (20) Business Days
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right
to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the consent of the Company,
Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i) reduce
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce
the Offer Price, (iii) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition,
(iv) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any Offer
Condition in any manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock, (v)
except as required or permitted in this  _Section 1.1(a)_,

 



2  terminate, extend or otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the
Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (vii)
otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any
manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock or (viii) provide any
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ , (i) if
at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer any Offer Condition shall not
have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable Law
and this Agreement), Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without the
consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in
consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days each (the length of
such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub), or for any such period
longer than five (5) Business Days as the parties hereto may agree, until the
earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and (B) October 30, 2015 (the " _End Date_ "); (ii) if at any scheduled
expiration date of the Offer any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied
or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable Law and this Agreement),
at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) extend the Offer, on one or more occasions, in consecutive
increments of up to five (5) Business Days each (the length of such period to
be determined by Parent or Merger Sub), or for any such period longer than
five (5) Business Days as the parties hereto may agree, until the earlier of
(A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (B) the
End Date; and (iii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum
period required by applicable Law or the applicable rules, regulations
interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff or the New York Stock
Exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Merger Sub be required
to extend the Offer (x) beyond the End Date or (y) at any time that Parent or
Merger Sub is entitled to terminate this Agreement. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares
of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer promptly after the expiration of the Offer. Payment of shares of
Company Common Stock by Merger Sub pursuant to and subject to the conditions
of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and
the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Offer Closing Date_." The Offer may not be terminated prior to its
expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in
accordance with this _Section 1.1(a)_), unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall promptly (and, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer. The termination of the Offer pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence is referred to this Agreement as the "
_Offer Termination_ ," and the date on which the Offer Termination occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination Date_." If the Offer
is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders
thereof.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and
a related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer

 



3  documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the
documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that
is required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for
amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the
Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC), on the other hand. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Offer
Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of
the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) with respect thereto, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or
response.

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and, if Parent
and Merger Sub have received the prior consent of the Company, any
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act. The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
affiliates not to, tender to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer any shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the
Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "),
which shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_, describe and make
the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer, and shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock. Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or
otherwise disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock together with
the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock.
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company

 



4  shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. Prior to the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination
thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on
such document or response. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company
and any other information contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly (and in any event within
fifteen (15) days after the date of this Agreement) with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common
Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and of those persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all
lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all
other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub
such information (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep confidential and not disclose
the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files, in
each case as required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 1.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue under the name
"Norcraft Companies, Inc." as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware.

Section 1.4  _Merger Closing; Effective Time_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and pursuant to the DGCL
(including Section 251(h) of the DGCL), the closing of the Merger (the "
_Merger Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, 1211
Avenue of the Americas,

 



5  New York, New York, promptly, but in no event later than the second (2nd)
Business Day, after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_ (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be
satisfied until the Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Merger Closing), or at such other place or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. At the Merger
Closing, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate
of Merger and agreed to by Merger Sub and the Company, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.5 _Effects of the Merger Section_. The Merger will have the effects
set forth herein and in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become debts, liabilities and duties of

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock, held by a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

(b)  _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, each share of Company Common Stock resulting from the exchange of LLC
Units for Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ below) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Company Common Stock to be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this  _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with 
_Section 2.2_, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



7 (d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there is a change in the fully diluted number of outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares (other than the exchange of
LLC Units for Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ below), or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change.

(e)  _Exchange of LLC Units_. Immediately prior to the cancellation and
conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section
2.1(b)_ above, in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) of the
Exchange Agreement dated as of November 13, 2013, among the Company, SKM
Norcraft Corp., Trimaran Cabinet Corp., and the holders of LLC Units (as that
term is defined therein) from time to time party thereto (the " _Exchange
Agreement_ "), the Company shall cause each LLC Unit (as defined in the
Exchange Agreement) (each an " _LLC Unit_ "), whether vested or unvested, to
be exchanged for one share of Company Common Stock. The Company Board shall
take, or cause to be taken, all necessary and appropriate actions so that all
LLC Units shall be vested in full as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Payment Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_
"), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.1(b)_ and _Section 2.3_. Immediately prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an
amount equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (such Total Common
Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Payment Fund_
"). In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to
be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent
shall cause the Payment Fund to be held for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock and applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

 



8 (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions (including, without limitation, any necessary Tax forms),
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, to be mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered
by wire transfer, as elected by the surrendering holder, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time
or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
forthwith canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered (the "
_Transferee_ ") if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establishes to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for cash,
without interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

 



9 (f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article II_ , and, following any investment losses that lower the Payment
Fund below the level required to pay the Total Common Merger Consideration,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.2(a)_, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
directed by Parent.

Section 2.3 _Stock Options_

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option in consideration
for the right at the Effective Time to receive, a cash payment with respect
thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ ,"
and the sum of all such payments, the " _Total Option Cash Payments_ "). As of
the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash
Payment in respect thereof.

(b) On the first (1st) regular Company payroll date following the Effective
Time or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay through its payroll systems the applicable Option
Cash Payments, if any, to the holders of Company Options, subject to _Section
2.4_.

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Equity Plan as of the Effective Time.

(d) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option or any
participant in the Equity Plan or any other Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit arrangement of the Company or any party to any employment agreement
with the Company will have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock
or other equity interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights) in the Company, any of its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholdings_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent and the Surviving Corporations payroll agent (the " _Payroll Agent_ ")
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Options such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Payroll Agent are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or

 



10  any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Payroll Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Payroll Agent.

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.1(b)_, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived,
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL
(including through entry into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required to be made with respect
to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation, and the
Total Common Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for
dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a
stockholder on the date of the Merger Closing. Any portion of the Total Common
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
2.2_ to pay for Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent upon demand. The
Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or
payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or
permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time,

 



11  they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger
Consideration, as provided for in _Section 2.1(b)_, for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.

as required by Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are

of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2014,

weakness" in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting or (iii)
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of
the Company who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls
over financial reporting. There is no outstanding "significant deficiency" or
"material weakness" which the Companys independent accountants certify has
not been appropriately and adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as disclosed in the separate disclosure schedules which has been
delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
(which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to
the numbered and letter sections contained in this Agreement and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify and apply to other
sections in this Agreement only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
on its face that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other
sections) (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedules_ "), Parent and Merger Sub
hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power, authority
and governmental approvals would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Other Organizational
Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents), and other organizational or
governing documents, agreements or arrangements, each as amended to

 



27  date, of each of Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, " _Parent
Organizational Documents_ "). The Parent Organizational Documents are in full
force and effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any
provision of the Parent Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Parent and Merger Sub,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and
to general equitable principles).

 

Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions or
compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions of this
Agreement will (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) of (x) Parent
or (y) Merger Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals and authorizations
specified in _Section 4.4(b)_ have been received and the waiting periods
referred to therein have expired, and any condition precedent to such
consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been satisfied, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any property
or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound or affected or (iii) result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub or any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such violations,
breaches, defaults, rights, terminations, amendments, accelerations, or
cancellations which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub,
the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions or compliance by
Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions of this Agreement will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization, waiver or permit of, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except for applicable
requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or Blue 

 



28  Sky Laws, (ii) any applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) the DGCL, and (iv) the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and except where failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.5 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Support Agreements),
neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any contract, arrangement
or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which:
(a) any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration
of a different amount or nature than the Offer Price or the Merger
Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i) agrees
to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer or, if required by
applicable Law, to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees
to vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any
Superior Proposal; or (b) any third party has agreed to provide, directly or
indirectly, equity capital to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in
part the Offer or the Merger.

 

Section 4.6 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no claim,
action, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
any of their respective properties or assets at law or in equity, and there
are no Orders by or before any court, arbitrator or other Governmental
Authority, in each case as would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.7  _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the
Information Statement will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC,
at any time such document is amended or supplemented or at the time such
document is first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent makes no representation
or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of
their respective Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Offer Documents as the Schedule 14D-9.

 

Section 4.8 _Funds_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has sufficient
cash and/or access to sufficient resources to, and as of the Offer Closing
and at the Merger Closing, Parent will have, and will cause Merger Sub to
have, available the funds necessary to, consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including payment in cash of the Total Common
Merger Consideration, and to pay all related fees and expenses. Parent
acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are not contingent or
conditioned in any manner on obtaining any financing.

 

Section 4.9 _Ownership of Merger Sub_. Parent indirectly owns beneficially and
of record all outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, it has not conducted
any business activity prior to the date of this Agreement and it has conducted
its operations only as contemplated hereby.

 



29 Section 4.10 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
have not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.

 

Section 4.11 _Brokers_. Other than RBC Capital Markets, LLC, whose fees and
expenses shall be borne solely by Parent, no broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and any of the other Transactions based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

 

Section 4.12 _Solvency_. None of Parent or Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is Solvent as of the date of this Agreement, and each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of
the Transactions, the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and the aggregate
Merger Consideration, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all
related fees and expenses, be Solvent at the Effective Time. As used in this
_Section 4.12_, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to a particular
date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of
Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on
a consolidated basis) will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger
Sub (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated
basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does not believe
that it will incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts
mature, and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub (and, after the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) has sufficient capital and
liquidity with which to conduct its business at the Effective Time. For
purposes of this _Section 4.12_, " _debt_ " means any liability on a claim,
and " _claim_ " means any (a) right to payment, whether or not such a right
is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and
(b) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach
gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is
reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 

Section 4.13 _Parent Ownership of Company Securities_. Other than through any
rights as may be conveyed to Parent or its subsidiaries pursuant to the
Support Agreements, Parent and its subsidiaries do not beneficially own (as
such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares
of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities
of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or
otherwise) in, the Company.

 



30 Section 4.14 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement
(a) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes, or has made, any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and Parent and Merger Sub are not
relying on any representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth
in this Agreement, (b) no person has been authorized by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or
its business or otherwise in connection with the Offer and Merger, and if
made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or
Merger Sub as having been authorized by such entity, and (c) any estimate,
projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation
or any other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Representatives, including any materials or information
made available in the electronic data room or in connection with presentations
by the Companys management or otherwise, are not and shall not be deemed to
be or include representations or warranties unless and to the extent any such
materials or information is the subject of any express representation or
warranty set forth in _Article III_.

Proposal and (y) engage in discussions and negotiations with, and furnish non-
public information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries and afford
access to the books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries to any
Third Party in connection with a Competing Proposal or any inquiry,
discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Competing Proposal; _provided_ that prior to furnishing such information or
affording such access, (i) the Company has entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party, and (ii) the Company has
previously provided or made available (or concurrently provides or makes
available) such information to Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.4_ to the contrary, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
its subsidiaries to, reimburse or agree to reimburse the expenses of any
Third Party (other than its Representatives) in connection with a Competing
Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal.

 

(b) On the Go-Shop End Date: (i) the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its directors, officers, Representatives and subsidiaries to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions
or negotiations with, any Third Party (other than Excluded Parties) relating
to any Competing Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal; and (ii)
the Company shall as promptly as possible request that each Third Party (other
than any Excluded Party) that has previously executed a confidentiality or
similar agreement in connection with its consideration of a Competing
Proposal to return to the Company or destroy any non-public information
previously furnished or made available to such Third Party or any of its
Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement in place with such
Third Party.

 



36 (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the determination by the
Company Board that a Third Party is an Excluded Party and in any event no
later than the earlier of (x) two (2) Business Days after such determination
and (y) Go-Shop Period End Date: (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent a
written notice setting forth: (A) the identity of each Excluded Party and
each other Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, has (or is
expected to have) a material equity interest in the Competing Proposal
proposed by such Excluded Party; and (B) the material terms and conditions of
the pending Competing Proposal made by such Excluded Party (it being
understood that price per share, structure (including the requirement for such
Excluded Party to make any TRA Termination Payment), to the extent part of
the Competing Proposal, closing conditions, and financing provisions shall be
considered material terms of any such pending Competing Proposal); and (ii)
the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of all proposed definitive
documents received by the Company or any of its Representatives from any such
Excluded Party or its Representatives relating to any Competing Proposal. In
addition, from and after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day of receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of any
Competing Proposal or any inquiry or request that could reasonably be expected
to lead to any Competing Proposal, (i) deliver to Parent a written notice
setting forth: (A) the identity of the Third Party making such Competing
Proposal, inquiry or request; and (B) the material terms and conditions of any
such Competing Proposal (it being understood that price per share shall be
considered a material term of any such Competing Proposal); and (ii) deliver
to Parent copies of all proposed definitive documents received by the Company
or any of its Representatives from any such Third Party or its
Representatives relating to any such Competing Proposal. The Company shall

Proposal, inquiry or request on a prompt basis, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days thereof.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4_, the Company shall
not, shall cause its directors, officers and subsidiaries not to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Representatives not to,
from the Go-Shop Period End Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1_, directly or indirectly, (x) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiry by, discussion with, or offer or request
from any Third Party (other than a Third Party that is then an Excluded Party)
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing
Proposal, (y) engage in any discussions or negotiations with (other than to
state they are not permitted to engage discussions or negotiations), or
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to, or afford access to the books or records of the Company or
its subsidiaries to, any Third Party (other than a Third Party that is then
an Excluded Party) that, to the knowledge of the Company, is seeking to make,
or has made, a Competing Proposal, or (z) approve, endorse, recommend or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive
agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to
any Competing Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(e) At any time after the Go-Shop Period End Date and prior to the Offer
Closing, the Company or its board of directors, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (i) furnish nonpublic information to any
Third Party making a Competing

 



37  Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Third Party and previously provided such information to
Parent), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party
with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case if: (x) such Third Party
has submitted a bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from
a breach of this _Section 5.4_ and that the board of directors of the
Company, or any duly authorized committee thereof, determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (y) the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to taking any of
the actions referred to in this _Section 5.4(e)_, the Company shall notify
Parent and Merger Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-
public information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this _Section 5.4(e)_.

(f) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(f)_ or _Section
5.4(h)_, neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation; (B) approve, adopt, endorse
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse or recommend, any
Competing Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of a written request by Parent
to provide such reaffirmation ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) such five
(5) Business Day period shall be extended for an additional five (5) Business
Days following any material modification to any Competing Proposal occurring
after the receipt of Parents written request, (II) such reaffirmation may
include such additional disclosures as would reasonably be necessary to
satisfy the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company or
comply with applicable Law), and (III) Parent shall be entitled to make such a
written request for reaffirmation only once for each Competing Proposal and
once for each material amendment to such Competing Proposal); (D) fail to
recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,
against any Competing Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange
Act within five (5) Business Days after commencement of such Competing
Proposal; or (E) take any action to exempt any person (other than Parent and
its affiliates) from the provisions of any Takeover Statute (any of the
actions described in clause (i) of this _Section 5.4(f)_, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the board of directors of
the Company shall be permitted (x) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, if the board of directors of the Company (A) has
received a Competing Proposal that, in the good faith determination of the
board of directors of the Company (after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors), constitutes, a Superior Proposal, after having complied
with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to, _Section 5.4(g)_, and (B) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, or (y) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change described in
clause (A) of such definition, if the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



38 (g) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided a written
notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub that the
Company intends to take such action and describing the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action
(including the identity of the Third Party and providing copies of all
proposed definitive documents), (ii) during the four (4) Business Day period
following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives and
affiliates to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the
extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement intended to cause such Superior
Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iii) following the
end of the four (4) Business Day period, the board of directors of the Company
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors and taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to the Notice of
Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Each
amendment or modification to the financial terms or any other material terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and
the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 5.4(g)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the four (4)
Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the Companys stockholders), or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys stockholders) if the board of directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosures
permitted under this _Section 5.4(h)_ shall not be a basis, in themselves,
for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_.

 

Section 5.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions), existing
as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former directors
or officers, as the case may be, of the Company as provided in the Companys
or each of the Companys subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing
documents) currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless,

 



39  and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions
by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent required by the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions referenced in subsections (i) above in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees with respect
to any acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.5(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law: (i) indemnify and
hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (x) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (y) the
Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby;
and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of
any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.5(b)_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may
be sought under this  _Section 5.5(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitees
who are subject to such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any
Indemnitee.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as promptly as
practicable to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in all material
respects than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does
not exceed 250% of the annual premium paid by the Company in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement for such insurance (the "
_Current Premium_ "). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the

 



40  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) continue to maintain in effect, for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time (or until such time as such
"tail" insurance policies are obtained), the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in
all material respects than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the Current Premium; and
_provided_ _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this  _Section 5.5_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.5_. The provisions of this _Section 5.5_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 5.5_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnitee with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.6_ to
the contrary, this _Section 5.5_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and
their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys
all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any person alleging that the
consent, approval, permission or waiver of such person is or may be required
in connection with any of the Transactions, (c) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions, (d) any Stockholder Litigation, and (e) the discovery by
a party to this Agreement of any fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence
or non-occurrence of which could reasonably be expected to result in (i) the
failure of any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement to be true or correct in all material respects at or prior to the
Merger Closing, (ii) any

 



41  failure of such party to comply in all material respects with such partys
covenants or agreements hereunder, or (iii) the failure of any of the
conditions of the obligations set forth in _Article VI_ or _Annex I_ to be
satisfied or the satisfaction of which to be materially delayed; _provided_
that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall
not be considered in determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ or _Annex I_ have been satisfied.

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases issued by
Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent or the Company. Thereafter, the parties
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements, or scheduling a press conference or conference
call with investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and none of the parties shall issue any such press release or
make any public statement prior to obtaining the other partys consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such
consent shall be necessary to the extent a party determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, disclosure is required by Law,
Order or applicable stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party
hereto, in which case such party shall consult with the other party about, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable
time (taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, and such comments will be considered
in good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may discuss this
Agreement and the Transactions, including their effect on Parents business
and its financial projections, with investors and analysts, including, without
limitation, on its quarterly earnings calls, so long as Parents comments are
not inconsistent with the press releases previously issued and agreed upon by
the parties.

Section 5.8  _Employee Matters_.

(a) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and the determination of levels of
severance and vacation pay (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes
of any equity plan or benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan), under the compensation and benefit plans, programs agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
respective subsidiary and affiliate thereof providing benefits after the
Effective Time under new Company Benefit Plans (the " _New Plans"_ ) to one or
more of those employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are
actively employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who
continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company,
the Company subsidiaries and their respective affiliates before the date of
the Merger Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the date of the Merger Closing, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such service credit will
result in the duplication of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of

 



42  such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan
during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; _provided_
that such Company Employee provides evidence of payment of such expenses in a
form that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent, its affiliates, insurers or
third-party service providers.

(b) The Company shall terminate the Norcraft Companies 401(k) Retirement Plan
(the " _401(k) Plan_ ") by proper Company action and in a form approved by
Parent, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Offer
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the 401(k) Plan
to the contrary, on or before the Offer Closing Date, the Company shall
contribute all employer contributions (including employer matching and
nonelective contributions) payable under the 401(k) Plan.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any representative of any
such employee, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any period or terms of employment, for any nature
whatsoever or (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of or modifying the
terms of employment of any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
including the amendment, adoption or termination of any employee benefit or
compensation plan, program or arrangement, after the date of the Merger
Closing. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall constitute the
establishment of or an amendment to or any other modification of any Company
Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit plan or agreement.

Section 5.9 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Merger Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date hereof
and the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, if any,
pursuant to _Section 7.1_, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall not
permit any of its subsidiaries to, take or agree to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

 

Section 5.10 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, (b) cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness.

 

Section 5.11 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have been or
will be entered into after the date of this Agreement by the Company or
its subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of
the Company or its subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

 



43 Section 5.12 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys or its subsidiaries operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its subsidiaries operations.

 

Section 5.13 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate
to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by any officer or director
of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.14 _Delisting and Deregistration_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under applicable Law (including the rules and policies of the New York Stock
Exchange) to cause the delisting of the Company Common Stock from the New York
Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration with the SEC of the Company Common Stock at the Effective
Time.

Section 5.15 _Payoff Letters_. Upon the request of Parent no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain customary payoff letters for indebtedness of borrowed
money of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Any such payoff letter shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent from all financial
institutions and other persons (or the applicable agent, trustee or other
representative on behalf of such persons) to which indebtedness for borrowed
money of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is owed, which payoff letters
together with any related release documentation shall include (i) the payoff
amount and (ii) confirmation that any Liens and guarantees granted in
connection therewith related to the assets, rights and properties of the
Company and its subsidiaries securing such indebtedness for borrowed money and
any other obligations secured thereby shall be, upon the payment of the amount
set forth in the applicable payoff letter at or prior to the consummation of
the Offer, released and terminated. The Company shall deliver or cause to be
delivered any such payoff letters, together with the related release
documentation, to Parent at the Offer Closing.

 

Section 5.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense and settlement
of, any Stockholder Litigation. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to
address any Stockholder Litigation. No compromise or full or partial
settlement of any Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(i) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or by Parent
pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ and (A) a Competing Proposal has been made
to the Company after the date hereof and has not been withdrawn prior to the
termination of this Agreement, and (B) within twelve (12) months after
the termination of this Agreement, the Company (1) enters into a definitive
agreement for the consummation of a Competing Proposal and such Competing
Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of whether such consummation
occurs within the twelve (12) month period) or (2) consummates a Competing
Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation of such

  



47  transaction arising from such Competing Proposal (provided, however, that
for purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)(i)_, the references to "twenty percent
(20%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)");

(ii) the Company pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with such
termination;

 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_, then
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee not
later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination; or

 

(iv) the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(v)_, and within twelve (12)
months after the termination of this Agreement, the Company (1) enters into a
definitive agreement for the consummation of a Competing Proposal and such
Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of whether such
consummation occurs within the twelve (12) month period) or (2) consummates a
Competing Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation of such transaction
arising from such Competing Proposal (provided, however, that for purposes of
this _Section 7.3(a)(iv)_, the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the
definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the
Termination Fee is not a penalty but a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company or its successors for the payment of any amount set forth in this
_Section 7.3_, the Company or its successors shall pay Parent its reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the

actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by

be no amendment that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
each of the parties hereto.

 



48 Section 7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 7.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 7.6 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. All Expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all
documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains,
registration, value added, transfer, stamp, recording and similar Taxes, fees,
and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees,

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer
and the Merger (and the other Transactions) be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.

Section 9.5  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure
Schedules, the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
5.5_, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except for, if the Merger Closing occurs,
the right of the holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right of holders of Company Options to receive the
Option Cash Payment, in each case after the Effective Time. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 7.5_
without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 7.5_ without notice or liability to any
other person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks

 



60  associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be
entitled to specific performance or any other equitable relief in order to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Offer or the Merger unless:

(i) all conditions in _Annex I_ and _Section 6.1_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Closing or
Merger Closing, as applicable) have been satisfied or waived; and

 

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Merger Closing by the
date the Merger Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 1.2_.

Section 9.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware,
for the purpose of any action, proceedings or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the

 



61  negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceedings may be heard and determined exclusively in any
Delaware state or federal court.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal
delivery of copies of such process to such party and nothing in this 
_Section 9.9_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of
the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware
in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
(iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
(iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
if (but only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final
judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. A signature page
to this Agreement, the agreements referred to herein, and each other agreement
or instrument entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated
hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, that contains a copy
of a partys signature and that is sent by such party or its agent with the
apparent intention (as reasonably evidenced by the actions of such party or
its agent) that it constitute such partys execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any such other document, including a document sent by means of a
facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document format ("
_pdf_ "), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from
earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document, will be
disregarded in determining the partys intent or the effectiveness of such
signature. At the request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument, each other party hereto or thereto will re execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument will raise the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in pdf as a defense
to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each such party forever
waives any such defense.

Section 9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

 



62  AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

 

Section 9.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Disclosure Schedules shall have the meanings assigned to them in this
Agreement. The disclosure set forth in a partys Disclosure Schedules shall
provide an exception to or otherwise qualify (a) the representations and
warranties of such party contained in the section or subsection of
this Agreement corresponding by number to such disclosure and (b) the other
representations and warranties of such party in this Agreement to the extent
it is reasonably apparent from a plain reading of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other representations and warranties. The
listing of any matter on a partys Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material, is required to be disclosed by such party under this
Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards
set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in a partys Disclosure Schedules
relating to any possible breach or violation by such party of any contract or
Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of
any matter in a partys Disclosure Schedules be deemed or interpreted to
expand the scope of such partys representations, warranties and/or covenants
set forth in this Agreement.

 

 _[Remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page follows.]_

 



63 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the
Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the
Offer if:

 

(a) there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior

Offer (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

(b) (i) any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under
the HSR Act relating to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger shall not have expired
or otherwise been terminated or (ii) the affirmative approval or clearance of
Governmental Authorities required under Antitrust Laws of the United States
relating to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the consummation of the Merger have not been obtained; or

of the expiration of the Offer:

or entered any Law or Order which is then in effect and has the effect of
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger;

 

(ii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
the Fundamental Company Representations shall not have been true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement or shall not be true
and correct in all material respect as of the expiration of the Offer with the
same force and effect as if made as of the expiration of the Offer (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date), and (B) any of the other representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality
or " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " qualifications therein), shall not
have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or shall not be
true and correct as of the expiration of the Offer with the same force and
effect as if made as of the expiration of the Offer (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except
in the case of this clause (B) for such failures to be true and correct as

rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and
Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in their
sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by
Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
