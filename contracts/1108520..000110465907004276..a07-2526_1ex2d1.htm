NRS. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any such demands, or offer to settle, or settle, any
such

        

demands. Any amount payable to any holder of Company Common Stock exercising
appraisal rights shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation out of its
own funds.

  

2.7 _Payment for Shares_.

  

(a) _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent (i) shall
designate a bank or trust company satisfactory to the Company to act as agent
for the holders of Company Capital Stock in connection with the Merger (the "
** _Paying Agent_** ") to receive in trust the funds to which holders of
Company Capital Stock and Warrants shall become entitled pursuant to _Section
2.6_ and _Section 2.8(b) _and (ii) shall deposit, or cause the Merger Sub to
deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Companys Stockholders
and holders of Warrants, cash in an amount sufficient for the payment of (x)
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.6_ upon surrender of
certificates representing the shares of Company Capital Stock as provided
herein and (y) the Warrant Cash Amount as provided in _Section 2.8(b)
_upon surrender of instruments representing the Warrants as provided
herein (together, the " ** _Exchange Fund_** "). The Paying Agent shall
invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund only in obligations guaranteed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. All interest
earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent.

  

(b) _ Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, but in
any event not later than two Business Days thereafter, the Paying Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of (x) a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Capital
Stock (the " ** _Company Certificates_** ") or a Warrant and (y) any non-
certificated shares held by book entry (" ** _Book Entry Shares_** "), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Company Certificates or Warrants to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form
and have such other provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Company Certificates, Warrants
and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Warrant
Cash Amount, as the case may be, as provided in _Section 2.6_. Exchange of
any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange
Agents customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book
entry. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate, Warrant or Book Entry Share
for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Book Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
and the holder of such Warrant shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Warrant Cash Amount, and the Company Certificate, Book Entry
Share or Warrants so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the
preceding sentence promptly following the valid surrender of Company
Certificates, Book Entry Shares or Warrants. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Capital Stock or Warrants that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Company Certificate or Warrants so surrendered
is registered, if such Company Certificate or Warrant is properly endorsed or
otherwise is in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
****the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Company Certificate or Warrant or establishes to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.7(b)_, each Company
Certificate, Book Entry Share and Warrant shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6_ in the case of a Company
Certificate or Book Entry Share and the Warrant Cash Amount in the case of a
Warrant. No interest will be paid or will

        

accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate or
Book Entry Share. All amounts payable hereunder to a holder of Company Stock
shall be rounded to the nearest cent.

  

(c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock; Transfer
Books._ All Merger Consideration and Warrant Cash Amounts paid upon the
surrender of Company Certificates, Book Entry Shares and Warrants in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Capital Stock theretofore represented by such Company Certificates, Book
Entry Shares and Warrants, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, provided that no dividends or other
distribution shall be owed with respect to the Warrants. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of Company Capital Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Certificates, Book Entry Shares or Warrants are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration or a Warrant Cash Amount, as
the case may be, as provided in this _Article II_.

  

(d) _ No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.7_, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person with respect to any Merger Consideration or
Warrant Cash Amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

(e) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Company
Certificates evidencing Company Capital Stock or Warrants are lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration
required pursuant to _Section 2.6 _or the Warrant Cash Amount
required pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_, as the case may be, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates or Warrants, upon the
making of an affidavit, which shall include indemnities and the posting of a
bond that are reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the holder
thereof with such assurances as the Paying Agent, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration or the Warrant
Cash Amount, as the case may be, may reasonably require of the holder of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates or Warrants.

  

(f) _ Withholding Taxes._ Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Capital
pursuant to this Agreement any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " ** _Code_** "), or any applicable provisions of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Company Capital Stock with respect to
which such deduction and withholding were made. The parties recognize and
agree that no withholding shall be required under Section 1445 of the Code.

  

2.8 _ Options and Warrants._

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding Option (as hereinafter defined),
whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable, each Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall immediately and
fully vest, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this
_Section 2.8_, each such Option shall terminate and be cancelled at the
Effective Time and each

        

holder of an Option shall be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall
receive promptly following the Effective Time in settlement of each Option an
Option Cash Amount. The " ** _Option Cash Amount_** " shall be equal to the
net amount of (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Option, less (B) any applicable
withholdings for Taxes (which withholdings shall be deposited with the
appropriate taxing authority for the benefit of the holder of such Option).
If the exercise price per share of any Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the Option Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Payment of the
Option Cash Amount shall be communicated to each holder of Option(s) in a
written notice from the Company stating that, upon acceptance of the Option
Cash Amount, such holder understands that no further payment is due to such
holder on account of any Option and all of such holders rights under such
Options have terminated. As used in this Agreement, " ** _Option_** " means
any option granted and not exercised, expired or terminated, to a current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the plans set forth in _Section 2.8(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, or any other stock option, stock bonus,
stock award, or stock purchase plan, program, or arrangement of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof (" ** _Company
Stock Plans_** ") or any other contract or agreement entered into by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. All amounts payable hereunder to
a holder of an outstanding Option shall be rounded to the nearest cent.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Warrant (as
hereinafter defined) shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive the Warrant Cash Amount. The " ** _Warrant Cash Amount_** " shall be
equal to the net amount of the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Warrant,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Warrant. If the
exercise price per share of any Warrant equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the Warrant Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Payment of the
Warrant Cash Amount shall be payable without interest upon surrender of the
instrument representing the Warrant and other documentation specified in
_Section 2.7(b)_. As used in this Agreement, " ** _Warrant_** " means
any warrant granted and not exercised, expired or terminated, to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the form of agreement set forth in
_Section 2.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. All amounts payable
hereunder to a holder of an outstanding Warrant shall be rounded to the
nearest cent.

  

(c) At the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 2.8_, all
rights under any Option and any provision of the Company Stock
Plans providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest with respect
to the capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, as of and after the
Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 2.8_, no person shall
have any rights under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or
arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, Company
shall be permitted hereunder to make any amendments to the terms of
the Company Stock Plans (and any agreements thereunder) as are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.8_.

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 2.8_ and any other dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 **ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

Except as set forth in the corresponding section or subsections of the
disclosure schedule of the Company dated as of the date hereof and delivered
to Parent concurrently with the parties execution of this Agreement (the "
** _Company Disclosure Schedule_** "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

3.1 _ Organization._ The Company and each entity that is a Subsidiary of
the Company as of the date hereof (each such Subsidiary, a " ** _Company
Subsidiary_** ") is a corporation, limited liability company or partnership,
as the case may be, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite entity power and
authority and all necessary government approvals to own, operate and lease
its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed, as may be required, and in
good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character of the property owned, leased
or used by it makes such qualification and/or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified and/or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. A " ** _Company Material
Adverse Effect_** " means any effect, event or change that is materially
adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise), results of operations or prospects of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries considered as a single enterprise or that prevents or materially
impedes or delays the ability of the Company to perform in all material
respects its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that any
event, condition, change, occurrence or development of a state of
circumstances that (i) results from changes in the United States economy so
long as the Company is not disproportionately affected in comparison to other
companies in the same industry; (ii) results solely from changes in the oil
and gas exploration and production industry so long as the Company is not
disproportionately affected in comparison to other companies in the same
industry; and (iii) the public announcement or existence of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall not be considered in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall
include, without limitation, a declaration of a banking moratorium or any
suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States, the United
Kingdom or France (whether or not mandatory). The copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company that are incorporated by reference as
exhibits to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended
December 31, 2005 (the " ** _Most Recent Form 10-KSB_**") are complete and
correct copies of such documents and contain all amendments thereto as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which the Company
Stockholders may vote.

  

(b) As of the close of business on January 18, 2007, there were outstanding
Options to purchase 1,558,268 shares of Company Common Stock. _Section
3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the outstanding

such Option and the aggregate Option Cash Amount of all outstanding Options.
There are no stock appreciation rights attached to the Options. As of the
close of business on January 18, 2007, there were outstanding Warrants to
purchase 569,938 shares of Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.50

or of any of the Company Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to issue or enter into any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement.

Agreement (i) there have been no issuances by the Company of shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company and (ii) there have

provisions of, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any
property or asset of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries under any
Material Contract; or (iii) subject to obtaining or making the consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,

 **ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB**

  

Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Company that:

  

4.1 _ Organization._ Parent and each of the Subsidiaries of Parent
(including Merger Sub) (each such Subsidiary of Parent, a " **
_Parent Subsidiary_** ") is a corporation, limited liability company
or partnership, as the case may be, duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite
entity power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to
carry on its business as now conducted. Parent and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed and in good standing in each
of the jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character of the property owned, leased or used by it makes such
qualification and/or licensing necessary. The copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Parent provided to the Company are complete and
correct copies of such documents and contain all amendments thereto as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

4.2 _ Merger Sub._ Merger Sub is an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent and, since the date of its incorporation, has not carried on any
business or conducted any operations other than the execution of this
Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary
thereto.

  

4.3 _ Authorization; No Conflict._

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite power and authority to
enter into and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents
contemplated hereby to which it is a party. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger
Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
(including any vote of any class or series of outstanding capital stock) are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their respective obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to the rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law and
equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

  

(b) The Board of Directors of Parent has, by resolutions duly adopted by the
requisite vote of the directors present at a meeting of such board duly
called and held on January 18, 2007 and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, unanimously (i) approved this Agreement and the Merger
and (ii) determined that this Agreement and Merger are in the best interest
of Parents stockholders. No vote of the holders of Parents ordinary shares
or other securities of Parent is necessary to approve the Merger.

        

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger
Sub, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict
with the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries; (ii) result in a violation or breach of or
conflict with any provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or
result in the termination, cancellation or acceleration (whether after the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both) of the terms, conditions or
provisions of, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any
property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub under any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, contract, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation of any kind to which Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound; or (iii)
subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in
paragraph (d) below, violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, law, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets other
than any such event described in items (ii) or (iii) which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. A " ** _Parent Material Adverse Effect_** " means a material
adverse effect that prevents or materially impedes or delays the ability of

Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is necessary to be

be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iv) Customary Post-Closing Consents, except where
the failure to obtain or take such action, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

4.4 _ Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders
or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No
representation of warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub beneficially owns any Company Common
Stock.

        

4.8 _ Litigation._ There are no suits, actions or legal, administrative,

by such party contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in

pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall be subject to the provisions of
the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated October 11, 2006, as

Agreement_** ").

  

6.7 _ No Solicitation._

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company shall
not, and the Company shall cause its Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys and other

submission of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal; (ii) except as permitted
by this  _Section 6.7_, approve or recommend any Alternative Transaction
Proposal; (iii) except as permitted by this _Section 6.7_, enter into any
Contract, agreement-in-principle or letter of intent with respect to, or
accept any, Alternative Transaction Proposal; or (iv) except as permitted by
this _Section 6.7_, participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person other than Parent any information with
respect to, or knowingly take any action that is intended or designed to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an
Alternative Transaction Proposal by anyone other than Parent; _provided,
however_ , that: (A) nothing contained in this _Section 6.7_ shall
prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to
the Company Stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange
offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, or from making any similar disclosure if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company based upon consultation
with legal counsel, failure so to disclose would violate its obligations
under Applicable Law; and (B) if, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
receives an unsolicited written Alternative Transaction Proposal from a third
party that the Board of Directors of the Company determines is, or is
reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, the Company and its
representatives may conduct such additional discussions (including
solicitation of a revised Alternative Transaction Proposal) and provide such
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person or group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal, as the Board of
Directors of the Company shall determine provided that (1) such Person or
group enters into a confidentiality agreement with terms no more favorable to
the Person or group making the Alternative Transaction Proposal than those
applicable to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement, (2) neither the
Company nor any officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys and other
advisors and representatives retained by and acting upon the authority of the
Company has violated any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.7_, (3) prior to furnishing any such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with,

        

such Person or group, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity
of such Person or group, the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and of the Companys intention to furnish
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person
or group and (4) contemporaneously with or promptly, but in no event more
than 24 hours, following furnishing any such information to such Person or
group, the Company furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent) (such
an Alternative Transaction Proposal in compliance with the foregoing proviso,
referred to herein as a (" ** _Qualified Transaction Proposal_** ")). In
addition to the foregoing obligations of the Company, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within 48 hours after any of the executive
officers of the Company becomes aware thereof, the Company shall advise
Parent of any request received by the Company for information which the
Company reasonably believes could lead to a Qualified Transaction Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such request or a Qualified Transaction
Proposal, and the identity of the Person or group making any such request or
Qualified Transaction Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed
promptly of material amendments or modifications to any such request or
Qualified Transaction Proposal, and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy
of all written materials (including written materials provided by email or
otherwise in electronic format) subsequently provided by or to it
in connection with such Qualified Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or any
applicable committee thereof) may (i) recommend, or publicly propose to
recommend, any Qualified Transaction Proposal (any of the events in the
foregoing clause being a " ** _Change of Company Recommendation_** "), or
(ii) allow the Company to enter into a binding written agreement concerning
__a transaction that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with legal counsel and its financial advisor)
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal if in the case of any of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), the
Board of Directors of the Company (or any applicable committee thereof)
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with legal counsel)
that failure to do so would violate its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, it being understood that neither (i) disclosure of any Alternative
Transaction that is not being recommended by the Board of Directors of the
Company nor (ii) disclosure of any facts or circumstances, together with a
statement that the Board of Directors of the Company continues to recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, shall be considered
to be a Change of Company Recommendation. Any action in compliance with the
terms of this _Section 6.7(b) _shall not constitute a breach of the
Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Qualified
Transaction Proposal is a Superior Proposal in conformity with _Section
6.7_, the Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f) provided_ that (i) the Company provides at least three
Business Days prior written notice to Parent of its intention to terminate
this Agreement, (ii) during such three Business Day period (or longer period
if extended by the Parent and the Company, the " ** _Negotiation Period_** "),
the Company agrees to negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding such
changes the Parent may propose to the terms of this Agreement, with the
intent of enabling Parent to make a modification of this Agreement so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated, (iii) after
expiration of the Negotiation Period, the Qualified Transaction Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal (taking into account any modifications to the
terms thereof proposed by the Parent) and the Board of Directors confirms its
determination (after consultation with its independent financial advisor)
that the Qualified Transaction Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (iv) the
Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

        

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, Affiliates and representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.7_ by the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, Affiliates and representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.7_ by the Company.

  

6.8 _ Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers; Insurance._

  

(a) _ Indemnification and Advancement._ From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who served as a director or officer of the Company or

_Company Indemnified Parties_** ") to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by Nevada law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with
any Claim (as defined below) and any judgments, fines (including excise

respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement)
resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within 30 days
after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Company Indemnified
Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Nevada law, as now
or hereafter in effect, any Expenses (as defined below) incurred in

any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the Company Indemnified Party of any
Expenses incurred by such Company Indemnified Party in connection
with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or
advancement. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall extend to acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time, and shall inure to the
benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section 6.8_, (1) the term " ** _Claim_**
" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the
Company or any governmental agency or any other party, that any Company
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative
dispute resolution mechanism, as a result of or in connection with such
Company Indemnified Partys service as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing
at or prior to the Effective Time; and (2) the term " ** _Expenses_** " means
attorneys fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations (including,
without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this _Section 6.8_, including any action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by a Company Indemnified Party.

  

(b) _ Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Indemnification Agreements._
In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.8(a)_, from and after
the Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger

        

Sub shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) include
and cause to be maintained in Merger Subs (or any successors) Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws for a period of at least six years from and after
the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of directors, officers and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the Companys
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement; and (ii) otherwise keep in full force and effect, and
comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the
date of this Agreement between or among the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and any Company Indemnified Party providing for the
indemnification of such Company Indemnified Party.

  

(c) _ Insurance._ For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and, if applicable, any Company Subsidiary, including with respect to
Claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time (including those related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby); provided, that Parent may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
that are no less advantageous to former officers and directors of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that if the aggregate
annual premiums for such policies at any time during such period will exceed
150% of the per annum premium rate paid by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such policies, then Parent shall be
required to provide only such coverage as will then be available at an annual
premium equal to 150% of such rate. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if Parent obtains
prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this _Section
6.8(c)_, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for
an aggregate period of six years after the Effective Time, including with
respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with
approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby). If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for
their duration.

  

(d) _ Successors._ If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merge with or into
any other Person and is not to be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Parent
shall take such action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume
all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

  

(e) _ Enforceability._ The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_) and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent
under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnified Party
under this _Section 6.8_ without prior written consent of such affected
Company Indemnified Party.

  

(f) _ Expenses._ Parent shall promptly pay (as incurred) all Expenses
that a Company Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the indemnity,
advancement and other obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

   

41   

   

(g) _ Burden of Proof._ In connection with any determination as to
whether the Company Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this
_Section 6.8_, the burden of proof shall be on the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to establish that a Company Indemnified Person is not so
entitled.

  

(h) _ Survival._ This _Section 6.8_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger; is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Person; shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent; and shall be enforceable by the Company Indemnified Persons.

  

6.9 _ State Takeover Laws._ Without limiting the generality of _Section
6.4_, if any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"business combination" or other takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation, applies or purports to apply to this Agreement and the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall (a) take all commercially reasonable action to
ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
(b) otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such takeover statute, law or
regulation.

  

6.10 _ Employment Matters._ The Company covenants and agrees that it
shall give notice pursuant to each Employment Agreement by and between the
Company and an executive officer of the Company (together, the " **
_Employment Agreements_** ") at least 30 days prior to June 1, 2007
that such Employment Agreements will not be renewed. Furthermore, the
Company covenants and agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into new employment agreements with each such executive
officer to be effective as of June 1, 2007, subject to and in a form approved
in writing by Parent in its sole discretion.

Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 **EXHIBIT A**

  

 **Form of Voting Agreement**

        

 **VOTING AGREEMENT**

  

 **THIS VOTING AGREEMENT** , dated as of January 19, 2007 (this "Agreement"),
is between Sterling Energy plc., a company incorporated in England and Wales
("Buyer"), and the other party signatory hereto (the "Stockholder").

  

 **WHEREAS,** Whittier Energy Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the
"Company"), Buyer and a subsidiary to be formed by Buyer ("Merger Sub") have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof
(the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (the "Merger") and each issued and
outstanding share (other than Dissenting Shares) of Company Common Stock will
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

  

 **WHEREAS,** as of the date hereof the Stockholder owns of record, and has
the right to vote and transfer the number of such shares of Company Common
Stock set forth beside such Stockholders name on the signature page hereto
(such shares of Company Common Stock, together with any other shares of
Company Common Stock acquired by such Stockholder by purchase or otherwise
from the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement, are
collectively referred to herein as the "Shares");

  

 **WHEREAS, ** as a condition and inducement to Buyers willingness to enter
into the Merger Agreement, Buyer has requested that the Stockholder agree to
enter into this Agreement; and

  

 **WHEREAS, ** capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE X 
 VOTING AGREEMENT; GRANT OF PROXY**

  

10.1 _ Voting Agreement._ (a) During the Term (as defined below) of this
Agreement, Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to vote
or cause to be voted all Shares that such Stockholder is entitled to vote to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby (collectively, the "Proposed Transaction") at any annual
or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and at any adjournment
thereof, at which the Proposed Transaction is submitted for the consideration
and vote of the stockholders of the Company ("Company Stockholder Meeting").

  

(b) Stockholder hereby agrees that it shall vote or cause to be voted its
Shares against the approval of (i) any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii)
any extraordinary dividend or distribution by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, (iii) any change in the capital structure of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (other than pursuant to the Merger
Agreement), (iv) any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, business
combination, share exchange, reorganization or recapitalization of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, with or involving any party other
than as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (v) any liquidation or winding
up of the Company, (vi) any change in the composition or membership of the
Companys Board of Directors, other than as permitted by the Merger
Agreement, and (vii) any other action that may reasonably be expected to
impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or discourage the consummation of the
Proposed Transaction or result in a breach of any of the covenants,
representations, warranties or other obligations or agreements of the Company
under the Merger Agreement, that would adversely affect the Company or Bidder
or their respective abilities to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.

  

(c) Stockholder hereby agrees that any agreement between or among the other
holders of Company Common Stock or any of them that could be construed to
limit its rights to enter into this

        

Agreement, perform hereunder, or restrict the Companys ability to consummate
the Merger is amended to the full extent necessary to assure that entering
into this Agreement and performance hereunder are permitted under each such
agreement without breach thereof.

  

10.2 _Irrevocable Proxy_. Stockholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to
its Shares. By entering into this Agreement, Stockholder hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally grants a proxy appointing a designee of Buyer
("Designee") as such Stockholders attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full
power of substitution, for and in such Stockholders name, to vote, express
consent or dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power on the matters
described in Section 1.01 as Designee or its proxy or substitute shall, in
Designees sole discretion, deem proper with respect to Stockholders Shares.
The proxy granted by Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.02 is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable and is granted in consideration of
Buyers entering into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and
incurring certain related fees and expenses. The Stockholder hereby ratifies
and approves of each and every action taken by a Designee pursuant to the
foregoing proxy. Stockholder shall perform such further acts and execute such
further documents as may be required to vest in Designee the sole power to
vote such Stockholders Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proxy
granted by Stockholder shall terminate at the end of the Term.

  

 **ARTICLE XI 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF STOCKHOLDERS**

  

Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to Buyer
that:

  

11.1 _ Authorization._ (a) If Stockholder is not an individual, the
Stockholder has full legal power, authority and right to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder, and the Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or similar action. This Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding Agreement of such Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms.

  

(b) If Stockholder is married and the Shares set forth on the signature page
hereto opposite such Stockholders name constitute community property under
applicable laws, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of, such
Stockholders spouse. If this Agreement is being executed in a representative
or fiduciary capacity, the Person signing this Agreement has full power and
authority to enter into and perform this Agreement.

  

(c) As of the date hereof and for as long as this Agreement remains in effect
(including the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting), such Stockholder has
full legal power, authority and right to vote all of the Shares then owned of
record or beneficially by such Stockholder in favor of the approval and
authorization of the Proposed Transaction without the consent or approval of,
or any other action on the part of, any other Person. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder has not entered into any voting
agreement (other than this Agreement) with any Person with respect to any of
the Shares, granted any Person any proxy (revocable or irrevocable) or power
of attorney with respect to any of the Shares, deposited any of the Shares in
a voting trust or entered into any arrangement or agreement with any Person
limiting or affecting its legal power, authority or right to vote the Shares
on any matter.

  

11.2 _ Non-Contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
Stockholder of this Agreement and the consummation by Stockholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and shall not (i) if Stockholder is
not an individual, violate any organizational documents of Stockholder, (ii)
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or
decree, (iii) require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration or to a loss of any benefit to which Stockholder
is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding
on Stockholder, (iv) result in the imposition of

        

any Lien on any asset of Stockholder, or (v) violate any other agreement,
arrangement or instrument to which Stockholder is a party or by which
Stockholder (or any of its assets) is bound, except (A) for any reports under
Sections 13(d) of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) as would not
prevent, delay or otherwise impair Stockholders ability to perform its
obligations hereunder.

  

11.3 _ Ownership of Shares._ Stockholder is the beneficial and record
owner of, and has the right to vote, the Shares, free and clear of any Lien,
option, right of first refusal, co-sale rights or any other limitation or
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote or otherwise
dispose of the Shares) except for any such encumbrances arising hereunder.
The term "beneficial owner" and all correlative expressions are used in this
Agreement as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 16a-1 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. None of the Shares is subject to any voting trust or
other agreement, arrangement or instrument with respect to the voting of such
Shares.

  

11.4 _ Total Shares._ Except for the Shares and the other securities of
the Company convertible or exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock
set forth beside Stockholders name on the signature page hereto, Stockholder
does not beneficially own any other shares of Company Common Stock or
securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
Company Common Stock.

  

11.5 _ Reliance by Buyer._ Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges
that Buyer is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  

 **ARTICLE XII 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER**

  

Buyer represents and warrants to Stockholder and the Company that:

  

12.1 The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
(the "Transaction Documents") by Buyer and the performance by Buyer of its
obligations thereunder and the consummation of the Proposed Transaction have
been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer. Each of
the Transaction Documents has been duly executed and delivered by, and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, Buyer, enforceable against
Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
or subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors
and of general principles of equity.

  

12.2 Neither the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents nor the
performance by Buyer of its obligations thereunder will result in a violation
of, or a default under, or conflict with, (A) any provision of its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited
liability company agreement or similar organizational documents, (B) any
contract, trust, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or
restriction of any kind to which Buyer is a party or bound, except, in the
case of clause (B), as would not prevent, delay or otherwise materially
impair Buyers ability to perform its obligations thereunder or
consummate the Merger. Execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction
Documents by Buyer will not violate, or require any consent, approval or
notice under, any provision of any judgment, order, decree, statute, law,
rule or regulation applicable to Buyer or the Shares, except (x) for any
reports under Sections 13(d) of the Exchange Act as may be required in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
(y) as would not reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or otherwise
materially impair Buyers ability to perform its obligations thereunder or
consummate the Merger.

  

12.3 There is no action, claim, suit, demand, hearing, notice of violation or
deficiency, or proceeding (including any investigation or partial proceeding,
such as a deposition), domestic or foreign,

        

pending, or to the knowledge of Buyer threatened, that could prevent the
consummation of, materially impair or materially delay the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 **ARTICLE XIII 
 COVENANTS OF STOCKHOLDERS**

  

Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that:

  

13.1 _ No Interference; No Transfers._ (a) Except pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, Stockholder shall not, without the prior written consent
of Buyer, directly or indirectly, (i) grant any proxies (revocable or
irrevocable) or enter into any voting trust, power of attorney or other
agreement or arrangement with respect to the voting of any Shares in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) voluntarily take any
action that would or is reasonably likely to (A) make any representation or
warranty contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or (B)
have the effect in any respect of preventing such Stockholder from performing
its obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) Transfer (or agree to
Transfer) any of the Stockholders Shares; provided, however, that the
restrictions in this Section 4.01 shall not be deemed violated by
any Transfer of Shares pursuant to a cashless exercise of stock options
or warrants.

  

(b) The term "Transfer" means, with respect to any security, the direct or
indirect assignment, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, hypothecation, or the
grant, creation or sufferance of a Lien in or upon, or the gift, placement in
trust, or the constructive sale or other disposition of such security (other
than transfers by testamentary or intestate succession or otherwise by
operation of law) of any right, title or interest therein (including but not
limited to any right or power to vote to which the holder thereof may be
entitled, whether such right or power is granted by proxy or otherwise), or
the record or beneficial ownership thereof, the offer to make such a sale,
transfer, constructive sale or other disposition, and each agreement,
arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, to effect any of the
forgoing. The term "constructive sale" means a short sale with respect to a
security (or substantially similar security), entering into or acquiring an
offsetting derivative contract with respect to such security (or
substantially similar security), entering into or acquiring a futures or
forward contract to deliver such security (or substantially similar security)

the effect of materially changing the economic benefits and risks of
ownership.

  

13.2 _ Other Offers._ Such Stockholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage (or
authorize any Person to solicit, initiate or encourage) any Alternative
Transaction Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussion or engage in
negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or afford access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to, any Person that may be considering making, or has made, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal or has agreed to endorse an Alternative
Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any
Person that may be considering making, or has made, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal and shall advise Buyer of the status and
material details of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal or request,
(iii) approve, endorse or recommend any of the foregoing, or (iv) enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or
commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any of the foregoing.

  

13.3 _ Appraisal Rights._ Stockholder agrees not to exercise any rights
of appraisal or any dissenters rights that Stockholder may have (whether
under applicable law or otherwise) with respect to any Shares or any other
shares of Company Capital Stock which may arise with respect to the Merger.

  

13.4 _ Additional Shares._ If after the date hereof, the Stockholder
acquires beneficial or record ownership of any additional shares of Company
Capital Stock (any such shares, "Additional Shares"),

        

including without limitation, upon exercise of any option, warrant, right to
acquire Additional Shares or through any stock dividend or stock split, the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Shares shall thereafter be
applicable to such Additional Shares as if such Additional Shares had been
Shares as of the date hereof. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be effective with respect to Additional Shares without action
of any Person immediately upon the acquisition by the Stockholder of such
Additional Shares.

  

 **ARTICLE XIV 
 MISCELLANEOUS**

  

14.1 _ Amendments; Termination._ Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. This Agreement shall terminate on the earliest of (i) the
Effective Time, (ii) the date of termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (iii) the mutual consent of Buyer and Stockholder,
(iv) the date of any amendment, waiver or modification to the Merger
Agreement in a manner that reduces the Merger Consideration, or (v) July 19,
2007 (such period from the date hereof until such termination is referred to
herein as the "Term"). In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in this Section 5.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any party
to this Agreement and this Article 5, except that nothing herein will relieve
any party from liability for any willful breach engaged in prior to such
termination of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this
Agreement.

  

14.2 _ Costs and Expenses._ All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

  

14.3 _ Successors and Assigns._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except
that Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer
of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  

14.4 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

  

14.5 _ Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile
shall be effective to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  

14.6 _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

        

14.7 _ Interpretation._ When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation" to the extent such words do not
already follow any such term. The word "or" shall not be exclusive. The
phrases "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be
deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. Other than Section 1.01(c), this Agreement is an
agreement between each of the Stockholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, and is not an agreement among the Stockholders.

  

14.8 _ Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court identified in Section 5.10, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

  

14.9 _ Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof. No provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

  

14.10 _ Submission to Jurisdiction._ All disputes relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts in
Houston, Texas. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (ii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the federal or state courts in
Houston, Texas; and (iii) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to
any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

14.11 _ Acknowledgment._ Buyer acknowledges that each Stockholder signs
solely in its capacity as the record and/or beneficial (as applicable) owner
of the Shares and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by
such Stockholder, or require such Stockholder to take any action, in his or
her capacity as an officer or director of the Company including to disclose
information acquired solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director.

Section 1. _ Time and Place of Meetings._ All meetings of the
stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose shall be
held at such time and place, within or without the State of Nevada, as shall

be held at the principal office of the Corporation.

  

Section 2. _ Annual Meetings._ An annual meeting of stockholders shall
be held for the purpose of electing directors and transacting such other
business as may properly be brought before the meeting. The date of the

for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by the Articles of
Incorporation or by law, (a) may be called by the President and (b) shall be
called by the Secretary (i) at the direction of a majority of the Board of
Directors, or (ii) at the request in writing delivered to the President or
the Secretary of the Corporation of stockholders owning a majority in amount
of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote.

  

Section 4. _ Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice._ Written notice of
each meeting of the stockholders shall be given to each stockholder entitled
to vote at such meeting. Such notice shall state (a) the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called, (b) the place, date and time of the meeting,
and (c) the means of electronic communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxies shall be deemed to be present in person and vote. Such notice
shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of
the meeting. Such notice must be in writing and signed by the president or a
vice president, or the secretary of an assistant secretary, or by such other
natural person or persons as the directors may designate. Business transacted
at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purpose or
purposes stated in the notice. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be
given under any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes or of the Articles
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in a signed writing or by
transmission of an electronic record by the person or persons entitled to the
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent thereto.

  

Section 5. _ Quorum; Adjournments._ The holders of a majority of the
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise required by
these By-laws, the Articles of Incorporation, or the Nevada Revised Statutes
as from time to time in effect (" _Nevada Law_ "). If a quorum is not
represented, the holders of the stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereat shall have power, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of such stock, to adjourn the
meeting to another time and/or place, without notice other than

        

announcement at the meeting, except as hereinafter provided, until a quorum
shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum
shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more
than thirty days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Withdrawal of
stockholders from any meeting shall not cause the failure of a duly
constituted quorum at such meeting.

to vote, in person, or by proxy appointed in an instrument in writing
subscribed by the stockholder or otherwise appointed in accordance with the

the record date for the meeting. Each stockholder shall be entitled to one
vote for each share of voting stock held by such stockholder, unless
otherwise provided in the Nevada Law or the Articles of Incorporation.

  

(b) When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy and voting shall decide any question brought before such
meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law
or of the Articles of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which
case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such
question. Any stockholder who is in attendance at a meeting of stockholders
either in person or by proxy but who abstains from the vote on any matter,
shall not be deemed present or represented at such meeting for purposes of
the preceding sentence with respect to such vote, but shall be deemed present
or represented at such meeting for all other purposes.

  

Section 7. _ Informal Action by Stockholders._ Any action required to be
taken at a meeting of the stockholders or any other action which may be taken
at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted. Such written consent may be signed in
counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, and
shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the stockholders.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have
not consented in writing.

  

 **ARTICLE III. 
 DIRECTORS**

  

Section 1. _ General Powers._ The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed and controlled by or under the direction of its
Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of, and do all such
acts and things as may be done by, the Corporation and do all such lawful
acts and things as are not by law or by the Articles of Incorporation or by
these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or done solely by the
stockholders.

  

Section 2. _ Number, Qualification and Tenure._ The Board of Directors
of the Corporation shall consist of not less than one member and not more
than ten members. Within the limit above specified, the number of directors
shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board
of Directors. The number of directors initially shall be fixed at three.
The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders,
except as provided in the Articles of Incorporation or Section 3 of this
Article, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her
successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
termination, resignation or removal from office. Directors need not be
stockholders.

   

C-3   

   

Section 3. _ Vacancies and Newly-Created Directorships._ Vacancies and
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of
directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each
director so chosen shall hold office until his or her successor is elected
and qualified or until his or her earlier death, termination, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office. If there are no
directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner
provided by Nevada Law.

  

Section 4. _ Place of Meetings._ The Board of Directors may hold
meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of
Nevada.

  

Section 5. _ Meetings._ The Board of Directors shall hold a regular
meeting, to be known as the annual meeting, immediately following each annual
meeting of the stockholders. Other regular meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined
by the Board of Directors. No notice of regular meetings need be given, other
than by announcement at the immediately preceding regular meeting. Special
meetings of the Board of Directors shall be called by the President or by the
Secretary on the written request of a majority of the Board of Directors.
Notice of any special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given at
least two days prior thereto, either in writing, or telephonically if
confirmed promptly in writing, to each director at the address shown for such
director on the records of the Corporation.

  

Section 6. _ Waiver of Notice; Business and Purpose._ Notice of any
meeting of the Board of Directors may be waived in writing signed by the
person or persons entitled to such notice either before or after the time of
the meeting. The attendance of a director at any meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and at the beginning
of the meeting records such objection with the person acting as secretary of
the meeting and does not thereafter vote on any action taken at the meeting.
Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or
special meeting of the Board need be specified in the notice or waiver of
notice of such meeting, unless specifically required by Nevada Law.

  

Section 7. _ Quorum and Manner of Acting._ At all meetings of the Board
of Directors, a majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum shall not be present at
any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may
adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. The act of a majority of the
directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act
of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided
by Nevada Law or by the Articles of Incorporation. Withdrawal of directors
from any meeting shall not cause the failure of a duly constituted quorum at
such meeting. A director who is in attendance at a meeting of the Board of
Directors but who abstains from the vote on any matter shall not be deemed
present at such meeting for purposes of the preceding sentence with respect
to such vote but shall be deemed present at such meeting for all other
purposes.

  

Section 8. _ Organization._ The Chairman of the Board, if elected, shall
act as chairman at all meetings of the Board of Directors. If the Chairman of
the Board is not elected or, if elected, is not present, the Vice Chairman,
if any, or if no such Vice Chairman is present, a director chosen by a
majority of the directors present, shall act as chairman at such meeting of
the Board of Directors.

  

Section 9. _ Committees._ The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted
by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, may designate one or more
directors to constitute an Executive Committee. The Board of Directors, by
resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, may create
one or more other committees and appoint one or more directors to serve on
such committee or committees. Each director appointed to serve on any such
committee shall serve, unless the resolution designating the respective
committee is sooner amended or rescinded by the Board of Directors, until the
next annual

        

meeting of the Board of Directors or until their respective successors are
designated. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of
the whole Board of Directors, may also designate additional directors as
alternate members of any committee to serve as members of such committee in
the place and stead of any regular member or members thereof who may be
unable to attend a meeting or otherwise unavailable to act as a member of
such committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member and all
alternate members designated to serve in the place and stead of such member,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified
from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another director to act at the meeting in the place and
stead of such absent or disqualified member.

  

The Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation between the meetings of the Board of Directors,
and any other committee may exercise the power and authority of the Board of
Directors to the extent specified by the resolution establishing
such committee, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws; _provided_
,  _however_ , that no committee may take any action that is expressly
required by Nevada Law, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws to be
taken by the Board of Directors and not by a committee thereof. Each
committee shall keep a record of its acts and proceedings, which shall form a
part of the records of the Corporation in the custody of the Secretary, and
all actions of each committee shall be reported to the Board of Directors at
the next meeting of the Board of Directors.

  

Meetings of committees may be called at any time by the Chairman of the
Board, if any, the President or the chairman of the respective committee. A
majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business and, except as expressly limited by this Section 9,
the act of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which there is
a quorum shall be the act of such committee. Except as expressly provided in
this Section 9 or in the resolution designating the committee, a majority of
the members of any such committee may select its chairman, fix its rules of
procedure, fix the time and place of its meetings and specify what notice of
meetings, if any, shall be given.

  

Section 10. _ Action without Meeting._ Unless otherwise specifically
prohibited by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or
of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of
the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, execute a
consent thereto in writing setting forth the action so taken, and the writing
or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board
of Directors or such committee. Such written consent may be signed
in counterparts, including, without limitation, facsimile counterparts, and
shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.

  

Section 11. _ Attendance by Telephone._ Members of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting
of the Board of Directors, or such committee, as the case may be, through the
use of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each
other. Participation in such meeting shall constitute attendance and presence
in person at the meeting of the person or persons so participating.

  

Section 12. _ Compensation._ Directors may be paid such compensation for
their services and such reimbursement for expenses of attendance at meetings
as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. These payments
shall not preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Corporation shall be signed by or in the name of the Corporation by (i) the
Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice
President and by (ii) the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation. Where a certificate
is countersigned by a transfer agent, other than the Corporation or an
employee of the Corporation, or by a

        

registrar, the signatures of one or more officers of the Corporation may be
facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed
or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have
ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, the certificate may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if such officer, transfer agent or registrar were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of its issue.

  

Section 2. _ Transfer._ Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed
or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate
of stock or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate theretofore
issued by the Corporation to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old
certificate and record the transaction in its stock transfer books.

  

Section 3. _ Replacement._ In case of the loss, destruction, mutilation
or theft of a certificate for any stock of the Corporation, a new certificate
of stock or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate theretofore
issued by the Corporation may be issued upon the surrender of the mutilated
certificate or, in the case of loss, destruction or theft of a certificate,
upon satisfactory proof of such loss, destruction or theft and upon such
terms as the Board of Directors may prescribe. The Board of Directors may in
its discretion require the owner of the lost, destroyed or stolen
certificate, or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond, in
such sum and in such form and with such surety or sureties as it may direct,
to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or
stolen.

  

 **ARTICLE VI. 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS**

  

Section 1. _ Third Party Actions._ The Corporation shall indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative, including all appeals (other than
an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
(and the Corporation, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, may so
indemnify a person by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or
agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation in any other capacity for or on behalf of the Corporation),
to the fullest extent permitted by law, including indemnifying such person
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, decrees, fines,
penalties, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful; _provided_ , _however_ , the Corporation shall be required to
indemnify an officer or director in connection with an action, suit or
proceeding initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding
was authorized by the Board of Directors. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that the person did not act in good faith or in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause
to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

  

Section 2. _ Actions By or in the Right of the Corporation._ The
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit,
including all appeals, by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation (and the Corporation, in the discretion of the
Board of Directors, may so indemnify a person by reason of the fact that he
is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation in any other capacity for or on behalf of the
Corporation), to the fullest extent permitted by law, including indemnifying

        

such person against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue
or matter as to which such person shall have been finally adjudged to be
liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action
or suit was brought, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as such court shall deem
proper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be required to
indemnify an officer or director in connection with an action, suit or
proceeding initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding
was authorized by the Board of Directors.

  

Section 3. _ Indemnity if Successful._ To the extent that a present or
former director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Section 1 or 2 of this Article, or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith.

  

Section 4. _ Standard of Conduct._ Except in a situation governed by
Section 3 of this Article, any indemnification under Section 1 or 2 of this
Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in Section 1 or 2, as applicable, of this Article. Such determination shall
be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of
such determination: (i) by a majority vote of directors who are not parties
to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (ii) by a
committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors,
even though less than a quorum; (iii) if there are no such directors, or if
such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion;
or (iv) by the stockholders. The determination to be made that
indemnification is proper with respect to a person who is a former director
or officer, or an employee or agent of the Corporation, shall be made by a
majority of the board of directors.

  

Section 5. _ Expenses._ Expenses (including attorneys fees) of each
officer and director hereunder indemnified actually and reasonably incurred
in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action,
suit or proceeding or threat thereof shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by former directors, officers,
employees, and agents may be so paid upon the receipt of the aforesaid
undertaking and such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors
deems appropriate.

  

Section 6. _ Nonexclusivity._ The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, other Sections of this Article
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may now or hereafter be entitled
under any law, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office.

  

Section 7. _ Insurance._ The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any

        

such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability
under the provisions of the Nevada Law.

  

Section 8. _ Definitions._ For purposes of this Article, references to
"the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had the power and authority to indemnify any or all of
its directors, officers, employees and agents, so that any person who was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation in any other capacity,
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have
had with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence
had continued as such corporation was constituted immediately prior to such
merger.

  

For purposes of this Article, references to "other capacities" shall include
serving as a trustee or agent for any employee benefit plan; references to
"fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to
an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by
such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee
benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries. A person who acted in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the
best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article.

  

Section 9. _ Severability._ If any provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the other provisions hereof shall remain
in full force and effect in such jurisdiction, and the remaining provisions
hereof shall be liberally construed to effectuate the provisions hereof, and
the invalidity of any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

Section 10. _ Amendment._ The right to indemnification conferred by this
Article shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each
person referred therein until amended or repealed, but no amendment to or
repeal of these provisions shall apply to or have any effect on the right to
indemnification of any person with respect to any liability or alleged
liability of such person for or with respect to any act or omission of such
person occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.

versa_ , and reference to either gender includes the other gender.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII.

These By-laws may be altered, amended or repealed or new By-laws may be
