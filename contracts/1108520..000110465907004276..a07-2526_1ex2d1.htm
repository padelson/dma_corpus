the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;<i> provided, however</i>, that any event, condition, change,
occurrence or development of a state of circumstances that (i)&nbsp;results

industry; (ii)&nbsp;results solely from changes in the oil and gas exploration
and production industry so long as the Company is not disproportionately
affected in comparison to other companies in the same industry; and
(iii)&nbsp;the public announcement or existence of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall not be considered in determining
whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall include, without limitation,
a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect
