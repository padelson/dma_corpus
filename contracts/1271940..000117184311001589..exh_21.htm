officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 3.1 Conversion of Securities At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or its
shareholders, the following shall occur:

  

  

(a) Conversion Generally. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any (i) Company Shares to
be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), (ii) Company Shares which are held by
shareholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of the FBCA (such Company
Shares, the "Dissenting Shares" and such shareholders, the "Dissenting
Shareholders") and (iii) Rollover Shares) shall be converted, subject to
Section 3.2(d), into the right to receive $9.00 in cash, payable to the holder
thereof, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time,
all such Company Shares shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each (i) Company Share (including Rollover
Shares) held by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Rollover Share shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(d) Change in Shares. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split,
combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and
to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

  

  

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the
paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for making the payments required to be made
at the Effective Time under Section 3.1 and Section 3.5 and in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Merger Sub and the Company. Prior to the Closing,
Merger Sub shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares and Vested Company Options,
cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of
the Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger pursuant to
Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding Company Shares and the aggregate
amount payable at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.5 in respect of
Vested Company Options (collectively, such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). Merger Sub shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section
3.1 and the aggregate amounts to be paid at the Effective Time in respect of
Vested Company Options pursuant to Section 3.5 out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub
or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that: (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable under Section 3.1 and the payments to be made pursuant to Section 3.5;
(ii) no such investment shall have maturities that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to Section 3.1 and
Section 3.5, and (iii) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash
in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (including as a
result of any Dissenting Shareholder effectively withdrawing its demand for,
or losing its right to, appraisal rights), Merger Sub or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit or cause to be
deposited cash in immediately available funds into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall become part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts payable at
the Effective Time under Section 3.1 and (in respect of Vested Company
Options) Section 3.5 should be returned to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as directed by Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares (the "Certificates", it being
understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to
include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

  

  

customary form and with such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
determine prior to the Closing (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or, if such shares
are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a
book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry
account statement)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if
such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a
book-entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Company Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, to be mailed, made available for collection
by hand or delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the surrendering holder,
within three (3) Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the Paying Agent\'s receipt of such Certificate (or,
if such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a
book-entry account statement), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Company Shares which is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or
reported, as required. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares
represented thereby as contemplated by Section 3.3.

 

  

  

(c) Further Rights in Company Shares. All Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for nine (9) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any holders of Company Shares who have not theretofore complied
with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation,
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable, for payment of their claims
for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, to which such
holders may be entitled.

  

  

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon.

  

  

(g) No Further Dividends. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

  

  

(h) Withholding.

  

  

(i) Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent, and the Company (and any other
Person that has a payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement) shall only be
entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such Taxes imposed
under PRC Law or under the Code that are (A) specifically provided for in
Section 3.2(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (B) required as a result of
a change in relevant Law or published administrative practice by a
Governmental Entity on or prior to the Closing Date or (C) required pursuant
to a written notice received from any Governmental Entity on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and the Company (and any other
Person that has a payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law other than PRC Law
or under the Code.

  

  

(iii) In the event that Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Company
(or any other Person that has a payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement)
determines that withholding is required under applicable Law and permitted
under this Agreement, Parent shall so notify the Company in writing at least
five days prior to the Closing Date (or as soon as practicable prior to the
Closing Date if the circumstances giving rise to such withholding obligation
occur less than five days prior to the Closing Date) to provide the
shareholders of the Company with sufficient opportunity to provide any forms
or documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding.
To the extent that amounts are deducted or withheld under applicable Law, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

  

  

Section 3.3 Dissenters\' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if any Dissenting Shareholder shall demand to be paid the "fair
value" of its Dissenting Shares, as provided in Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of
the FBCA, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

  

  

Consideration (except as provided in this Section 3.3) and shall entitle such
Dissenting Shareholder only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares, in accordance with Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of the FBCA, unless and
until such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws (in accordance with Section
607.1323(2) of the FBCA) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make (or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of
fair value of Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting Shareholder
shall have failed to perfect or effectively withdrawn or lost the right to be
paid the fair value under Sections 607.1321 and 607.1323 of the FBCA, then the
Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1.

 

  

  

Section 3.4 Share Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items
contemplated by this Article III) and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Shares theretofore outstanding on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

  

  

Section 3.5 Company Options and Company Restricted Shares.

  

  

(a) Equity Award Waivers. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or
releases, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from
holders of Company Options and Company Restricted Shares or other equity
awards under the Company Share Plans and take all such other action, without
incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, as Parent may deem to be
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.5.
As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company
Share Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are
required to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.5.

  

  

(b) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Vested Company
Option at the Effective Time a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the Exercise Price of such
Vested Company Option, and (ii) the number of Company Shares underlying such
Vested Company Option, less applicable withholding Taxes; provided that if the
Exercise Price of any such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be canceled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Promptly following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of a
Vested Company Option informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on the
Vested Company Options.

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Unvested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company
Option shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation
or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries shall pay from time to time after
the Effective Time to each former holder of any such cancelled Unvested
Company Option, on the dates such Unvested Company Options would have vested
(subject to the same conditions on vesting as applied to the Unvested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time if such Unvested Company Option
had not been cancelled at the Effective Time as contemplated hereby), without
any crediting of interest for the period from the Effective Time until
vesting, a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the Exercise Price of such Unvested Company Option,
and (ii) the number of Company Shares underlying such Unvested Company Option
which would have vested on such date, less applicable withholding Taxes;
provided that if the Exercise Price of any such Unvested Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Unvested Company
Option shall be canceled without the requirement for any potential cash
payment to be made in respect thereof. Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of an
Unvested Company Option informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on
the Unvested Company Options.

  

  

(d) Company Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted
Share that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive, on the date such Company Restricted
Share would have vested (subject to the same conditions on vesting as applied
to each Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time if
such Company Restricted Share had not been converted at the Effective Time as
contemplated hereby), without any crediting of interest for the period from
the Effective Time until vesting, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration, less applicable withholding Taxes.

  

  

(e) Miscellaneous. All amounts payable under this Section 3.5 shall be reduced
by amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, PRC Law
or any other provision of applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment or settlement of any historical Taxes incurred in connection with
any Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and/or other equity awards
under the Company Share Plans. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
withholding or deduction was made.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

With respect to any Section of this Article IV, except (i) as disclosed in any
of the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the
SEC, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act (other than any disclosures set
forth in any "Risk Factors", "Forward-Looking Statements", "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" sections and any other disclosures
to the extent they are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature),
on or after December 31, 2009 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"SEC Reports") (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any SEC

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

  

  

Report shall be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure in such SEC Report that such disclosure is applicable to such
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, other than, in each case, any
matters required to be disclosed for purposes of Section 4.2 (Capitalization)
of this Agreement which matters shall be specifically disclosed in Section 4.2
of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or (ii) as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

 

  

  

Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Florida. Except as set forth in Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a "Company Subsidiary") has
been duly organized, and is validly existing and, where such concept is
recognized, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and the Company and each
Company Subsidiary has obtained all applicable Permits relative to its
formation and organization from all applicable Governmental Entities except to
the extent the failure of any Company Subsidiary to be so organized, existing
or in good standing or of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to have such
Permits has not had and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete
list of all of the Company Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company
in each Company Subsidiary, and the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each Company Subsidiary. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority
has not had and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that have not and
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete and correct copies of the articles of incorporation and by-
laws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary (except for the Memorandum of Association of Zeetech System Private
Ltd.), each as amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force and

Company Shares subject to such Company Option, the expiration date of such
Company Option, the Exercise Price for such Company Option may be exercised
(if any) under an applicable Company Share Plan and the vesting schedule of

exercise of Company Options have been duly reserved for issuance by the
Company, and upon any issuance of such shares in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Share Plan, will be duly authorized, validly issued and

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and except for this Agreement, the Rollover Agreement and the Voting

share appreciation rights, "phantom shares" or other commitments that provide
any right to receive value or benefits similar to such capital stock,
securities or other rights). Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and except for this Agreement, the Rollover
Agreement and the Voting Agreements, there are no outstanding Contracts or
other obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary affecting the
voting rights of or requiring the repurchase, redemption, issuance, creation

through the date hereof, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital
stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock
or any other Equity Interests in the Company, except for issuances pursuant to
exercise of Company Options outstanding on such date in accordance with the

Schedule, there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
Contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements
relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase, exchange,

any Company Subsidiary,

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

  

  

including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or agreement.

 

  

  

(d) Section 4.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the
date hereof the name, jurisdiction of organization and the Company\'s (or the
Company Subsidiary\'s) percentage ownership of any and all Persons in which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary owns, or has the right or obligation to
acquire any Equity Interest (other than any Company Subsidiary) as of the date
hereof (collectively, the "Investments"). All of the Investments are owned by
the Company or by a Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except for
the capital stock and other ownership interests of the Company Subsidiaries
and the Investments, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any

or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than the

Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general equity principles (the

(b) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) the Special Committee has
received from Barclays (the "Company Financial Advisor"), its written opinion,
subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein,
that the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Shares
(other than any Company Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b),
Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) is fair from a financial point of view
to the holders of Company Shares and (ii) the Company Board (upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) has, at a meeting duly called and
held in which all directors were present in person or through telephone or
other electronic means, determined that this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interest of the Company and the holders of Company Shares,

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

  

  

and validly adopted resolutions (A) adopting this Agreement, (B) declaring
this Agreement and the Merger advisable, (C) directing that this Agreement be
submitted to the Company\'s shareholders for their approval, and (D)
recommending to the holders of Company Shares that they vote in favor of

subsequently withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent.

 

  

  

(c) The Special Committee is composed solely of directors who qualify as
"independent directors" (as such term is defined in Section 5605(a)(2) of
Nasdaq Marketplace Rule). The Special Committee has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions provided for herein, including the Merger, are
fair to and in the best interest of the Company and the holders of Company
Shares, and (ii) recommended that the Company adopt and approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, which

subsequently withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent.

  

  

Section 4.4 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

  

  

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not,
(i) assuming the Shareholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate
any provision of the Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company By-laws

copy of the mandate letter (the "Debt Financing Commitment Letter"), dated as

purposes of financing the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and related fees and expenses (the "Debt Financing"). Attached
hereto as Exhibit E is a true and complete copy of the equity commitment
letter (the "Equity Financing Commitment Letter" and together with the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitment Letters"), dated as of
the date of this Agreement, from the Guarantor and Bain Capital Fund X, L.P.
(together with the Guarantor, the "Sponsors"), regarding the proposed equity
investments set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and together with the

complete copy of the Rollover Agreement, pursuant to which the Rollover
Shareholders agreed to contribute to Parent and/or Merger Sub, as applicable,

to the Company a true and complete copy of any fee letter in connection with
the Debt Financing (it being understood that any such fee letter provided to

Financing Commitment Letters are not subject to any contractual conditions
other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. As of the date of
this Agreement, assuming Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to close pursuant
to Section 2.2, Parent and Merger Sub do not have reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied, that the Financing
will not be available to Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing, any of the
conditions to the contributions contemplated in the Rollover Agreement will
not be satisfied or that the contribution contemplated by the Rollover
Agreement will not be made to Parent on or before the Closing. The Equity
Financing Letter provides that, subject to the terms and conditions contained
therein, the Company is a third party beneficiary thereto with respect to the
provisions therein. As of the date of this Agreement, (A) each of the
Financing Commitment Letters and the Rollover Agreement is in full force and
effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger

default under the Financing Commitment Letters or the Rollover Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, by the other parties
thereto. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees

Financing Commitment Letters, (y) the Fee Letter, and (z) any other agreements
that do not impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing.

 

  

  

Section 5.7 Brokers. No broker, finder, financial advisor, investment banker
or other Person is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s
or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the
Company could have any liability prior to Closing.

  

  

Section 5.8 Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Limited
Guarantee with respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein. The
Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantor, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception, and no event has occurred, which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the

paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and the payment of all related fees and expenses, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent at and immediately after
the Effective Time. As used in this Section 5.9, the term "Solvent" shall
mean, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, in each case on a

Section 6.2 Proxy Statement; Schedule 13e-3; Company Shareholders Meeting

  

  

(a) Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall, with assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub,
prepare a proxy statement relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting
(together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy
Statement"). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC within twenty-one (21) days following
the date hereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish all information
as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. Subject to and without limiting the rights
of the Special Committee and the Company Board pursuant to Section 6.4(e), the
Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation.

  

  

(b) Schedule 13e-3. Concurrently with the preparation and filing of the Proxy
Statement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
its Affiliates (if applicable) to, jointly prepare and file with the SEC a
Rule 13e-3 transaction statement on Schedule 13E-3 (together with any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 13E-3") with respect
to the Merger.

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

  

  

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each other
in preparation of the Schedule 13E-3, including, without limitation,
furnishing to the others the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 13E-3.

 

  

  

(c) SEC Comments. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve and respond to as promptly as practicable
any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and/or the
Schedule 13E-3. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement
and/or the Schedule 13E-3 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information and will promptly supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of the Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
or filing the Schedule 13E-3 or any other required filings (or, in each case,
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and shall include in such
document or response comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to mail the Proxy Statement and all other
proxy materials to the holders of Company Shares as promptly as practicable
after having cleared SEC comments on the Proxy Statement and the Schedule
13E-3; provided that the Company shall not be required to mail the Proxy
Statement on or before the Solicitation Period End Date or, in the event the
Company is continuing to engage in activities pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(ii)
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Continuing Party on or
before the Solicitation Period End Date, the Cut-Off Date. If necessary in
order to comply with applicable securities Laws, after the Proxy Statement
shall have been so mailed, the Company shall promptly circulate amended,
supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection
therewith, re-solicit proxies.

  

  

(d) Information Supplied. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees,
as to it and its respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
or Representatives, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or any
other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, will, as of the time such documents (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are mailed to the holders of Company
Shares and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that all documents that such Party
is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable
Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. If

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

  

  

at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement
to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the Party discovering such event or
circumstance shall promptly inform the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such event or circumstance shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company to the extent required by Law; provided that prior to such filing, the
Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall consult with the other Party
with respect to such amendment or supplement and shall afford the other Party
and their Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

 

  

  

(e) Shareholders Meeting.

  

  

(i) Subject to Section 6.4(e), the Company shall duly call, give notice of and
hold a meeting of its shareholders in accordance with the FBCA, the Company
Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws (the "Company Shareholders
Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by
the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval; provided that
the Company shall not be required to call, give notice of or hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting on or before the Solicitation Period End Date or, in the
event the Company is continuing to engage in activities pursuant to Section
6.4(a)(ii) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Continuing
Party on or before the Solicitation Period End Date, the Cut-Off Date. The
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to its shareholders within a reasonable number of days prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, and the Company may, and Parent may on only one
occasion require the Company to, adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders
Meeting if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Shareholders Meeting or (B) voting in favor of approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to obtain the Shareholder Approval;
provided that in no event shall any such adjournment or postponement (x) be
longer than thirty (30) days after the originally scheduled meeting date or
(y) result in the Company Shareholders Meeting being held later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the End Date.

  

  

(ii) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining
shareholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company Shareholders
Meeting (the "Record Date") that is approximately forty (40) days prior to the
date of the Company Shareholders Meeting. Once the Company has established the
Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a
different record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent, unless required to do so

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

  

  

by applicable Law. In the event that the date of the Company Shareholders
Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or
otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise
approved in writing, it shall implement such adjournment or postponement or
other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new Record
Date for the Company Shareholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or
delayed, except as required by applicable Law.

 

  

  

(iii) Subject to Section 6.4(e), at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company Board (after and subject to the Special Committee\'s recommendation)
shall make the Company Recommendation and take all actions reasonably
necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Articles of
Incorporation and the Company By-Laws to solicit and obtain the Shareholder
Approval. Upon reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to advise Parent on a daily basis on each of the last
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect
to the Company Shareholder Approval.

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event the Company effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 6.4(e), this Agreement shall not be submitted to the
Company\'s shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval
and Section 6.2 (other than this Section 6.2(e)(iv)) shall cease to apply.

  

  

Section 6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality

  

  

(a) Access to Information. Subject to Section 6.3(b), from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall instruct each of
the Company Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the "Company Representatives") to: (i) provide to Parent and
Merger Sub and each of their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Parent Representatives") access at reasonable times during normal business
hours, upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, suppliers, customers, offices and other facilities of the Company
or such Company Subsidiary and to the books and records thereof and (ii)
furnish or cause to be furnished such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Representative may reasonably request; provided that the Company shall not be
required to (A) furnish, or provide any access to, any information to any
Person not a party to, or otherwise covered by, the NDA or any similar
agreement with respect to such information, (B) take or allow actions that
would unreasonably interfere with the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s
operation of its business or (C) provide access to or furnish any information
if doing so would violate any applicable Law or agreement with any Third
Party, or where such access to information may involve the waiver of any
privilege so long as the Company has taken all reasonable steps to permit
inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not
compromise the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s privilege with respect
thereto.

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Confidentiality and Restrictions. With respect to the information
disclosed pursuant to Section 6.3(a), the Parties shall comply with, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective
obligations under the NDA or any similar agreement entered into between the
Company and any Person to whom the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative provides information pursuant to this Section 6.3,
except as may be required with respect to the filing of any Tax Return or in
connection with any Tax controversy. The NDA shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the expiration of the NDA according to its terms.

provided to such Third Party; (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition

any such discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any

connection with the actions contemplated by this Section 6.4(a), except in a
manner consistent with the Company\'s past practice in dealing with the
disclosure of such information in the context of considering Acquisition
Proposals prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, the Company and its
officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct the Company
Subsidiaries and Company Representatives to, immediately after the
Solicitation Period End Date (or, as may relate to any Continuing Party,
immediately after the Cut-Off Date):

  

  

(i) cease all discussions and negotiations with any Persons that may be
ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and deliver a written notice
to each such Person to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions
and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
and the notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or destroy
all confidential information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; and

  

  

(ii) until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(A) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by providing

any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 

  


 

  

 

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

the Company to abandon this Agreement or the Merger; or

  


 

  

(E) resolve, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the
foregoing.

  


 

  

 

For the avoidance of doubt, after the Solicitation Period End Date, the
Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 6.4(b)
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Continuing Party on or
before the Solicitation Period End Date until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time)
on the fifteenth (15th) day following the Solicitation Period End Date (the

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(b) but
subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.4(c), at any time after the

provisions of this Section 6.4 and acting under the direction of the Special
Committee:

  

  

(i) contact the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal to clarify and

(ii) provide information in response to the request of the Person who has made
such Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, prior to providing such

take such action would be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties
under applicable Laws, and (y) the Special Committee shall have determined in
good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation
with its independent nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to any competitor in connection with the actions permitted by
Section 6.4(c)(ii), except in a manner consistent with the Company\'s past

nor any committee thereof shall:

otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal, (C) publicly take, disclose a position

(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or a statement that the Company Board
has received and is currently evaluating such Acquisition Proposal) that is
not an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (D) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or (E) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar

the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Approval, the Special Committee may (x) in response to an Intervening Event,
(A) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (B) authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement or (y) if the Company has received an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person (either before or after the Solicitation
Period End Date) that is not withdrawn and that the Special Committee
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, (A) effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or
(B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in
the case of both clause (x) and (y), if and only if:

  

  

(i) the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors\'
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;

this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.4(e)(y), (A) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the
"Superior Proposal Notice Period"), to the effect that the Company has
received an Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Special
Committee concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent
any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Special
Committee has resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iv), which
notice shall specify the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal,
the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to
such Superior Proposal, and (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period,
(1) negotiate with Parent and the Parent Representatives in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (2) permit Parent and the Parent
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board and the Special
Committee regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto
(to the extent Parent desires to make such presentation); provided that in the

new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 6.4 (including Section 6.4(e)) with respect to such new written
notice; provided further, that references to the five (5) Business Day period

its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act;
provided that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
or a statement that the Company Board has received and is currently evaluating
such Acquisition Proposal) that is not an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation in
favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act.

  

  

(g) After the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company agrees that it will
promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if any Acquisition
Proposals are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or
any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
the Company, the Company Board, the Special Committee or any Company
Representative indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal, the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (in any event, within 48 hours), of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto that are material in any respect) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company\'s intentions
as previously notified.

  

  

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any binding agreement or Contract with any Person to limit or
not to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in light of a
Superior Proposal.

use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and do or
cause to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
respective part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to cause the

Orders necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other

the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of
the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  

  

(c) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or any Parent Representative, or the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Company Representative, as the case may
be, from any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any of its other
Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with
the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 6.5(a) through Section 6.5(c), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or
if any

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

  

  

Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any applicable
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
contest, resist and resolve any such objections or Actions, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so
as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parties nor any of their Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall be
required to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of its businesses, services or assets.

 

  

  

Section 6.6 Financing 
 

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to arrange the Financing in a timely manner including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
(the "Debt Financing Agreements") with respect to, and on the terms and
conditions contained in, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter in a timely
manner, the terms and conditions of which shall not expand the conditions to
the closing of the Debt Financing contained in the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter, (ii) satisfy, or cause its Representatives to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions in the Debt Financing Agreements and the Equity Financing
Commitment Letter that are within its control, (iii) cause the Lenders and any
other Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing, (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Financing Commitment Letter, cause the Sponsors to fund the Equity Financing
at or prior to the Closing, and (v) subject to the terms and conditions of the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Equity Financing Commitment Letter,
draw upon and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. If any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing
Agreements, (x) Parent shall promptly so notify the Company, and (y) each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative debt financing from the same or alternate sources, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any
event no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the End Date), on terms
and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and
Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, the
Debt Financing Agreements and any related Fee Letter, in an amount sufficient
(assuming (A) the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity
Financing Commitment Letter, (B) the contributions contemplated by the
Rollover Agreement are made in accordance with the terms of the Rollover
Agreement, and (C) the satisfaction of the conditions to the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger as set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 or the waiver of such conditions by Parent) to consummate the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Alternate
Financing"), and to enter into new definitive agreements with respect to such
Alternate Financing

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

  

  

(the "New Financing Documents"). For the purpose of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall, upon the request of the Company, execute such New Financing
Documents or arrange for such Alternate Financing; provided that the terms and
conditions thereof (including the flex provisions) are not materially less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub, in the aggregate, than those included in
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Agreements that
such New Financing Documents are replacing. In the event any New Financing
Document is entered into, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" or "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (B) below,
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitment Letter" or
the "Debt Financing Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter that is not superseded by a New Financing Document
at the time in question and the New Financing Document to the extent then in
effect and (C) any reference in this Agreement to "Fee Letter" shall be deemed
to include any fee letter relating to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
that is not superseded by a New Financing Document at the time in question and
the New Financing Documents to the extent then in effect.

 

  

  

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Financing Commitment Letters and the Debt Financing Agreements
without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing (unless the Equity Financing or Debt Financing, as the case may be,
is increased by an amount corresponding to such reduction) or (ii) impose new
or additional conditions that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters or Debt Financing
Agreements. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the Lenders or the Sponsors under the
Financing Commitment Letters or Debt Financing Agreements, except as expressly
contemplated thereby.

  

  

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the
obtaining of the Financing or any Alternate Financing is a condition to the
Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any Alternate Financing, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in Article VII, the breach of which obligation
will give rise to the remedies set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 9.6, as
applicable.

  

  

(d) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of the Debt Financing Agreements as promptly as practicable upon their
execution, (ii) prior to the Closing, give the Company prompt notice of any
material breach or threatened material breach by any party to the Financing
Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Agreements, of which Parent or Merger
Sub becomes aware, or any termination thereof, and (iii) prior to the Closing,

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

  

  

otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of Parent and Merger Sub\'s efforts to arrange the Financing or
any Alternate Financing.

 

  

  

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreement immediately
prior to the Closing on the terms and conditions described in the Rollover
Agreements and shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Rollover Agreement and
Section 2.1(b) of the Voting Agreements without the prior written consent of
the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
if such amendment, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.7 Financing Assistance. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause each wholly-owned Company Subsidiary to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries (other than those
that are wholly-owned by the Company) and Company Representatives to, at
Parent\'s sole cost and expense, provide to Parent cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with, and customary for, the arrangement of
the Financing, including:

  

  

(a) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies;

  

  

(b) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank

or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting
the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor;

  

  

(c) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or
interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company or any borrowing
Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents of accountants for
use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) or
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including
delivery of pay-off letters and other cooperation in connection with the pay
off of existing Indebtedness and the release of all related Liens); provided
that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time;

  

  

(d) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources as promptly as practicable
with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements and projections and other pertinent information required
by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or as otherwise required in connection
with the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including information relating to the Company and Company Subsidiaries
(including information to be used in the preparation of one or more
information packages

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

  

  

regarding the business, operations and business plan or budget of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries) customary for the placement, arrangement and/or
syndication of loans or distribution of debt contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter to assist in preparation of customary offering or
information documents or rating agency or lender or investor presentations
relating to such placement, arrangement and/or syndication of loans) (all such
information in this clause (d), the "Required Financial Information");

 

  

  

(e) providing financial statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the
Company customarily prepares such financial statements within the time frame
such statements are prepared;

  

  

(f) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (i) permit the prospective
lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries\' current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements and (ii) establish bank and other accounts and blocked
account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing;
provided that such accounts, agreements and arrangements should not become
active or take effect until the Effective Time; and

  

  

(g) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources promptly with all
documentation and other information required by Governmental Entities with
respect to the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations.

  

  

Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would (i) require the Company to pay or agree to pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time (it being
understood, however, the Company shall bear all costs and expenses of its
annual audit) or (ii) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The effectiveness of any documents
executed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be subject to the
Closing having occurred. Parent or Merger Sub shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
Representatives in connection with such cooperation requested by Parent. All
non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the terms of the NDA. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives shall not, prior to the Effective Time, be required
to incur any liability to any person under any financing that Parent and
Merger Sub may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 6.7 for which
they are not reimbursed or indemnified by Parent. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries\' logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; provided that such logos shall be used in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely
affect the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

  

Section 6.8 Notices of Certain Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other orally and in writing of (a) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that,

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

  

  

individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, (b) any
Action commenced or, to any Party\'s knowledge, threatened against, such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving
or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case
in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated hereby (the "Transaction Litigation"), or (c)
the failure of any such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect
the Merger not to be satisfied; provided that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not cure any breach of any representation
or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any
Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII.

 

  

  

Section 6.9 Transaction Litigation. The Company and Parent shall give each
other the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; provided that neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary nor any Company Representative shall compromise, settle,
come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless
Parent shall have first consented thereto in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

Section 6.10 Publicity.

  

  

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release by the Company and Parent, and thereafter (except with respect to a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior
Proposal or any action taken by the Company, the Company Board or the Special
Committee permitted under Section 6.4) the Company and Parent each shall
consult with the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making
public announcements (including conference calls with investors and analysts)
with respect to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No Party shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent the disclosing
Party determines it is required to do so by applicable Law (including pursuant
to applicable fiduciary duties) or any listing agreement with Nasdaq, in which
case such Party shall use all reasonable efforts to consult with the other
Party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

  

  

(b) Before any Merger Communication of the Company or any of its
"participants" (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act) is
(i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the media, employee,
client, customer or other Third Party or otherwise made accessible on the
website of the Company or such participant (whether in written, video or oral
form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any executive
officer, key employee or advisor of the Company or any such participant, as a
script in discussions or meetings with any such Third Parties, the Company
shall (or shall cause any such participant to) cooperate in good faith with
Parent with respect to any such Merger

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

  

  

Communication for purposes of, among other things, determining whether that
communication constitutes "soliciting material" that is required to be filed
by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall (or
shall cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel on any such
Merger Communication.

 

  

  

Section 6.11 Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, except as otherwise may

all members of the Company Board who are in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.12 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent required by the Company
Articles of Incorporation and Company By-Laws and, without limiting the
foregoing, as required pursuant to any indemnity agreements of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in effect on the date hereof, each present and former
director and officer of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, settlements,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
such Indemnified Party\'s service as a director or officer of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or services performed by such Person at the request of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including (i) any and all matters
pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and (ii) any
claim arising from the transactions contemplated herein, and any actions taken
by Parent and/or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of
assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries which is
alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation and/or any of its
Subsidiaries insolvent). Out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys\' fees
and expenses) actually incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of any Action for which indemnification may be available hereunder
shall, if requested by the Indemnified Party, be paid by the Surviving
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Action (and in any
event within thirty (30) days of request for reimbursement by such Indemnified
Party) upon receipt of an irrevocable undertaking by the Indemnified Party to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to,
obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of the directors\' and
officers\' liability coverage of the Company\'s existing directors\' and
officers\' insurance policies, for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s
current insurance carrier with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the "DandO Insurance") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policy with respect to
any matter

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

  

  

claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policy pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of
the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
provided, further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may at its option purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than the Existing DandO Insurance and for a price no greater than
$300,000. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
respective obligations thereunder and all other obligations under this Section
6.12(b) shall terminate.

 

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.12 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and representatives.

  

  

Section 6.13 State Takeover Statutes. Parent, the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors (or with respect to the Company, the Special Committee, if
appropriate) shall (a) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions provided for in this Agreement and (b) if any Takeover Statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
transactions provided for in this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement or the
transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be
reasonably necessary and permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispositions of Company Shares (including

who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.15 Permits. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain or cause to be obtained as soon as practicable, but in any event prior
to the Effective Time, the items set forth in Section 6.15(a) of the Company

submit or cause to be submitted all required application materials to the
relevant Governmental Entities prior to the Effective Time for the purposes of

Section 6.16 Adoption by Parent. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event prior to the Closing Date), Parent shall take all
requisite action

cause to be taken, and following the Effective Time, Parent shall take or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the Nasdaq to cause the delisting of the Company of
the Company Shares from the Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

  

  

Section 6.18 Other Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section
6.2 and Section 6.4 none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall (i) take
any action that is intended to or would reasonably be likely to result in any
of the conditions to effecting the Merger becoming incapable of being
satisfied; or (ii) take any action or omission which would, or would be
reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,

(c) Officer\'s Certificate. The Company shall have received a certificate of a
duly authorized officer of Parent confirming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b).

  

  

Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Prior to the End Date, none of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in Article VII to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such
Party\'s failure to act in good faith to comply with this Agreement and
consummate the transactions provided for herein.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

  

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time,

before or after the Shareholder Approval:

  

  

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

  

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by 11:59 p.m., Hong Kong
time, on November 15, 2011 (the "End Date"); provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to any Party whose material breach of any provision of this
Agreement was the primary cause of the failure of the Merger to have been
consummated prior to the End Date; provided, further that any purported
termination of this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall be deemed a
termination under Section 8.1(b)(iii) if, at the time of any such purported
termination by the Company, either Parent or the Company is entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii);

  

  

(ii) if (x) any Order of any Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction
is entered enjoining the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the
Merger and such Order has become final and nonappealable or (y) a Law shall
have been enacted or promulgated or become applicable to the Parties or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited; provided that prior to termination
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii), each of the Parties shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent under, resolve or
lift, as applicable, the Order or Law and shall have complied in all material
respects with its obligations under Section 6.5; provided, further that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
primarily results in the imposition of any such Order or the enactment,
promulgation or applicability of such Law; or

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) if the Shareholder Approval is not obtained at the Company Shareholders
Meeting or any adjournment thereof at which this Agreement has been voted
upon;

  

  

(c) by the Company:

  

  

(i) if (x) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of the covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Parent or Merger

satisfied or (y) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the closing
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) would not be satisfied, and, in the case
of either (x) or (y), such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date
or is not cured by Parent of Merger Sub within thirty (30) calendar days after
Parent or Merger Sub receives written notice of such breach from the Company;
provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i) if, at the time of such termination, there
exists a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company contained in this Agreement that would result in the closing
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), as applicable, not
being satisfied;

  

  

(ii) if (x) all of the conditions to closing contained in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived by Parent (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (but
subject to their satisfaction or waiver by Parent at the Closing)), (y) on the
last day of the Debt Financing Period, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall have received the proceeds of the Debt Financing
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the failure to receive such proceeds is not caused by a material
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement to be complied with by Parent or Merger Sub or a material
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement, and (z) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing
within two (2) Business Days following the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.2;

  

  

(iii) if (x) all of the conditions to closing contained in Section 7.1 and

have been satisfied (other than funding of the Equity Financing) and the Debt
Financing will be funded during such period if the Equity Financing is funded
during such period, or (B) on the last day of the Debt Financing Period, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall have received the
proceeds of the Debt Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

  

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to receive such
proceeds is caused by a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by
Parent or Merger Sub or a material breach of any representation or warranty of
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement;

 

  

  

(iv) if prior to the obtaining of the Shareholder Approval, (x) the Company
Board has, upon recommendation of the Special Committee, authorized the
Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal and (y) the Company has concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement entered into, or immediately after the termination of this
Agreement, enters into, an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
the Superior Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (x); provided that
the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c)(iv) is conditioned on and subject to the concurrent or prior payment by
the Company of the Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager in accordance
with Section 8.2(b)(i) and any purported termination pursuant to this Section
8.1(c)(iv) shall be void and of no force or effect if the Company shall not
have paid the Company Termination Fee; provided, further that the Company
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c)(iv) unless the Company has complied in all material respects with the
requirements of Section 6.4 of this Agreement and the Company has complied in
all respects with the requirements of Section 6.4(e) that the Company is
required to satisfy before taking action pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(iv);
or

  

  

(v) if prior to the obtaining of the Shareholder Approval the Company has
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that the right of
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(v) is
conditioned on and subject to the concurrent or prior payment by the Company
of the Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager in accordance with Section
8.2(b)(i) and any purported termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(v)
shall be void and of no force or effect if the Company shall not have paid the
Company Termination Fee.

  

  

(d) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if (x) the Company shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Company such that the
closing condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied or (y)
there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied, and, in the case of either (x) or (y),
such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date or is not cured by the
Company, in the case of a breach of Section 6.4, within five (5) calendar days
after the Company receives written notice of such breach from Parent, and in
the case of any other breach by the Company, within thirty (30) calendar days
after the Company receives written notice of such breach from Parent or Merger
Sub; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if, at the time of such termination,

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

  

  

there exists a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that would result in the
closing conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), as
applicable, not being satisfied; or

 

  

  

(ii) if the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(e) Notice of Termination. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1 (other than under Section 8.1(a)) shall give
written notice of such termination to the other Parties specifying the
provision or provisions of this Section 8.1 pursuant to which such termination
is purportedly effected.

  

  

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination; Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement.

  

  

(a) Effect of Termination Generally. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 8.2, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers, directors or
Affiliates; provided that the provisions of Section 6.3(b), this Section 8.2,
Article IX and the NDA shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall any Party (or any member of the Parent Group or Company Group) be liable
for punitive damages.

  

  

(b) Company Termination Fee. Subject to Section 8.2(f):

  

  

(i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(iv) or Section 8.1(c)(v), the Company shall pay the Company
Termination Fee to the Fund Manager concurrently with or prior to such
termination by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by the Fund Manager; provided that in the event this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(v) prior to the
Solicitation Period End Date without the Company having entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement prior to or concurrently with such
termination, then (x) the Company shall pay 75% of the Company Termination Fee
to the Fund Manager concurrently with or prior to such termination and (y) in
the event the Company fails to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with any Person or group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Former Bidder)
prior to the Solicitation Period End Date, then the Company shall pay the
balance of such Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager within two (2)
Business Days after the Solicitation Period End Date.

  

  

(ii) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i) or Section 8.1(d)(ii), the Company shall pay the Company Termination
Fee to the Fund Manager promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business
Days after the date of such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to
one or more accounts designated by the Fund Manager; provided that in the
event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

  

  

8.1(d)(ii) prior to the Solicitation Period End Date without the Company
having entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement prior to or
concurrently with such termination, then (x) the Company shall pay 75% of the
Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager promptly, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination and (y) in the event
the Company fails to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with any
Person or group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Former Bidder) prior to
the Solicitation Period End Date, then the Company shall pay the balance of
such Company Termination Fee to the Fund Manager within two (2) Business Days
after the Solicitation Period End Date.

 

  

  

(iii) In the event that (x) an Acquisition Proposal (or the intention of any
Person to make an Acquisition Proposal), whether or not conditional, shall
have been made public and not withdrawn prior to the termination of this
Agreement, (y) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(iii), and (z) after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the first (1st) anniversary of the termination
of this Agreement, the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in
the preceding clause (x)), then the Company shall, on the date an Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, pay the Company Termination Fee (less the amount of
any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(d), if
any) to the Fund Manager by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Fund Manager; provided that for purposes of this
Section 8.2(b)(iii), all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be replaced with 50%.

  

  

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

  

  

(c) Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company in
accordance with Section 8.1(c)(i), Section 8.1(c)(ii) or Section 8.1(c)(iii),
then, subject to Section 8.2(f), Parent shall promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to
be paid to the Company (or its designees) an amount in cash equal to the
Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Company.

  

  

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay,
or cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(d) Expense Reimbursement. In the event this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) under circumstances in
which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to Section
8.2(b), then the Company shall, within thirty (30) Business Days following
receipt of an invoice therefor, reimburse the Fund Manager for all of
Parent\'s reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
reasonable legal

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

  

  

fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior
to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the "Parent
Expenses"), which amount shall in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate,
by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the
Fund Manager; provided that the existence of circumstances which could require
the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to
pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.2(d); provided, further
that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
8.2(d) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) except to the extent
indicated in Section 8.2(b).

 

  

  

(e) Acknowledgement. Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee
is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore,
the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c) are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. If the Company or Parent fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, commences an Action which results in a
judgment against the other party for the payment set forth in this Section
8.2, such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonably documented
costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on such amount at the
annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment is actually received.

  

  

(f) Limitations on Liabilities.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing when required by Section
2.2 for any reason or no reason or they otherwise breach this Agreement
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise
fail to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally
or otherwise), then, except for an order of specific performance as and only
to the extent expressly permitted by Section 9.6, the Company\'s right to
terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.2(c) and the guarantee of such obligations pursuant to the Limited
Guarantee (subject to their terms, conditions and limitations), shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and all members of the
Company Group (as defined below)

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

  

  

against (A) Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsors, (B) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, assignees of Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsors, (C) any lender
or prospective lender, lead arranger, arranger, agent or representative of or
to Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsors or (D) any holders or future holders of
any equity, stock, partnership or limited liability company interest,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
assignees of any of the foregoing (clauses A - D, collectively, the "Parent
Group"), for any loss or damage suffered as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or failure to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or other
failure of the Merger to be consummated (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor
any member of the Parent Group shall have any liability for monetary damages
of any kind or nature or arising in any circumstance in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Equity
Financing Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee and the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter) other than the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.2(c) and in no event shall any of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, the direct or indirect shareholders of the Company or
any other Person, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
(collectively, the "Company Group") seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of
any member of the Company Group, any monetary damages from any member of the
Parent Group in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Equity Financing Commitment Letter, the
Limited Guarantee and Debt Financing Commitment Letter), other than (without
duplication) from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent provided in Section
8.2(c) or the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee. In no
event shall the Company or any member of the Company Group be entitled to seek
the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than as
specifically set forth in Section 9.6. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the
extent expressly permitted by Section 9.6 and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(c), under no circumstances shall the
Company (or any member of the Company Group or any other Person) be permitted
or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance and payment of
the Parent Termination Fee (or any other money damages).

 

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Company fails to effect the Closing for any reason or no reason or
otherwise breaches this Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise fails to perform hereunder (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, except for an
order of specific performance as and only to the extent permitted by Section
9.6, Parent\'s right to terminate this Agreement and receive the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and/or the Parent Expenses

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

  

  

pursuant to Section 8.2(d), as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of any
member of the Parent Group against the Company Group (other than the Rollover
Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Rollover Agreement and/or the Voting
Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreements), for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) or failure to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or other failure of the Merger to be consummated
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise). For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor any member of the Company Group
(other than the Rollover Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Rollover
Agreement and/or the Voting Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Voting
Agreements) shall have any liability for monetary damages of any kind or
nature or arising in any circumstance in connection with this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing and the
Limited Guarantee) other than the payment of the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.2(c) and/or the Parent Expenses pursuant to Section
8.2(d) and in no event shall any of the members of the Parent Group seek, or
permit to be sought, any monetary damages from any member of the Company Group
(other than the Rollover Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Rollover
Agreement and/or the Voting Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Voting
Agreements) in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Financing and the Limited Guarantee), other
than (without duplication) from the Company to the extent provided in Section
8.2(b) or Section 8.2(d). For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent may pursue
both a grant of specific performance as permitted by Section 9.6 and the
payment of the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses pursuant to Section
8.2(b) and Section 8.2(d), respectively, under no circumstances shall Parent
(or any member of the Parent Group or any other Person) be permitted or
entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance and payment of the
Company Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses (or any other money
damages).

 

  

  

(iii) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any
termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which any of the Company
Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee is payable
pursuant to Section 8.2, payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent
Expenses or the Parent Termination Fee, as required hereunder, shall
constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any
other claim which the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on
the other hand, as the case may be, would otherwise be entitled to assert
against Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, as the case may be, or their respective assets, or against any of their
respective employees or equityholders (without limiting any claims otherwise
available to Parent against the Rollover Shareholders pursuant to the Rollover
Agreement and/or the Voting Shareholders pursuant to the Voting Agreements) or
any other member of the Parent Group or the Company Group, as the case may be,
with respect to any such termination of this

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

  

  

Agreement. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing upon any such termination of this Agreement under circumstances in
which any of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses or the Parent
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.2, the right to such payment
(A) constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement, and (B) shall be in full and
complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of any such
termination of this Agreement.

 

  

  

(iv) The provisions of this Section 8.2(f) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each member of the Company Group and the
Parent Group.

  

  

Section 8.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and, in the case of the
Company upon the approval of the Special Committee, subject to Section 8.4,
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein; provided that after any approval of this Agreement by the Company\'s
shareholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which
decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of
the Company\'s shareholders hereunder without the approval of such
shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

  

  

Section 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time; provided that the Company may only take such
action with the approval of the Special Committee; provided, further that
after approval of the Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no
amendment that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by such shareholders may be made without
further Shareholder Approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company.

Section 9.3 Fees and Expenses. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent and all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and fees
(including penalties and interest), incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by Article III. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring
such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

  

Section 9.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto), the Financing Commitment Letters, the Limited Guarantee, the Rollover
Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the NDA constitute the entire agreement
of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

Section 9.6 Specific Performance

  

  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.6(b),
each Party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the other Parties\' obligation to consummate the
Merger, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement),
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement,
in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 9.6(b), each Party hereby waives (i) any defenses in any
action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any Party
brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended by (x) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus
twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the
Delaware court presiding over such Action.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the right of
the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement shall be limited to seeking (i)
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies to enforce
Parent\'s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded at the
Effective Time but only in the event that (A) Parent and Merger Sub are
required to consummate the Closing

pursuant to Section 2.2, (B) the Debt Financing (and any Alternate Financing,
if applicable) has been funded or the lenders party to the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter have irrevocably confirmed in writing that all conditions to
funding of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter have been satisfied (other
than funding of the Equity Financing) and the Debt Financing will be funded in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the Debt
Financing Agreements (and any New Financing Documents, if applicable) at the
Effective Time if the Equity Financing is funded at the Effective Time, (C)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Financing (and
any Alternate Financing, if applicable) is funded, then it would take such
actions that are within its control to cause the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur, and (D) the Equity
Financing has not been funded and Parent and Merger Sub have not consummated
the Merger, and (ii) an injunction to specifically enforce the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 6.6. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no circumstance other than as expressly contemplated by this Section 9.6(b)
shall the Company be entitled under this Agreement to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically Parent\'s right to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the
Effective Time if the Equity Financing is funded at the Effective Time).

 

  

  

Section 9.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its principles
or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction other
than the State of Delaware except that matters relating to the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board and internal corporate affairs of the Company
shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Florida. Any Action (whether
sounding in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the Equity Financing Commitment Letter,
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, the Rollover Agreement, the Voting
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any
Action against any member of the Parent Group, shall be brought solely and
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided that
if (and only after) such court determines that it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over any such Action, such Action shall be brought solely and
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware;
provided, further that if (and only after) both the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over any such
Action, such Action shall be brought solely and exclusively in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Each of the
Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom)
in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts in respect of any such Action, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such Action in any such court in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9.7. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

  

  

inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court. Each
of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2
(Notices). Nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

  

  

(b) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any Action which may arise under
or relate to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any Action directly or indirectly arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any controversy or
Action involving any member of the Parent Group under any such agreement. Each
Party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney
of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
Party would not, in the event of Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver,
(ii) each Party understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver, (iii) each Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each Party
has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.7(b).

  

  

Section 9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.3(b)
(Confidentiality and Restrictions), Section 6.12 (Indemnification of Directors
and Officers), Section 8.2(f) (Limitations on Liabilities), Section 9.6
(Specific Performance), Section 9.7 (Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction;
Waiver of Jury Trial) and this Section 9.8 (No Third-Party Beneficiaries),
each of Parent and the Company hereby agrees that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The Parties hereto further agree that the rights of third
party beneficiaries under Section 6.12 shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs. The Fund Manager shall be a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement with respect to the right to receive the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and Parent Expenses pursuant to Section 8.2(d).
The Fund Manager may assign its right to receive the Company Termination Fee
and the Parent Expenses to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.

  

  

Section 9.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties; provided that prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger
Sub may assign all (but not less than all) of their rights and obligations
hereunder to a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of (x) Parent or (y)
the Sponsors (or any other investment fund advised or managed by the Fund
Manager) (provided that such assignment shall not (a) materially affect the
obligations of the Sponsors under the Equity Financing Commitment Letter, the
Lenders under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the Guarantor under the
Limited Guarantee, (b) impede, delay or adversely affect in any material
respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, or otherwise impede in any material respect the rights of the
Company or the shareholders of the Company hereunder) or (c) be effected in
favor of any

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

  

  

entity that competes or is likely to compete with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary). No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

  

  

Section 9.10 Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Company
Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

  

  

Section 9.11 Mutual Drafting. Each Party has participated in the drafting of
this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties.

  

  

Section 9.12 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in
one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
