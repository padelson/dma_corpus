SpinCo shall have the right to participate in any negotiations or proceedings with respect to any such Indemnified Claim. An Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of SpinCo, unless SpinCo has not, within 20 Business Days after the receipt by SpinCo of the indemnity Notice, given notice to the Indemnified Party that it wishes to dispute such Indemnified Claim. If SpinCo does give such a notice, it shall have the right to assume the defence of such Indemnified Claim and to defend such Indemnified Claim in the name of the Indemnified Party. An Indemnified Party shall provide to SpinCo all files, books, records and other information in their possession or control which may be relevant to the defence of such Indemnified Claim. If SpinCo fails after giving such notice, diligently and reasonably to defend such Indemnified Claim throughout the period such Indemnified Claim exists, its right to defend the Indemnified Claim shall terminate and the Indemnified Party may assume the defence of such Indemnified Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party may assume the defence of such Indemnified Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party may compromise or settle such Indemnified Claim without the consent of SpinCo. If the Effective Date occurs, Subsection 7.1 and 7.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of one year from the Effective Date, other than in the case of an Indemnified Tax Claim, which shall survive for the applicable statutory period.</P></TD></TR>
