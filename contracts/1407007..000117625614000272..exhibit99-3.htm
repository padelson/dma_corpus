Replacement Options, SpinCo Shares or SpinCo Options, as applicable will be
advised that the Class A Shares, Consideration Shares, Rio Alto Replacement

        |

the registration requirements otherwise imposed by that act, regarding the
distribution of securities of Rio Alto, Sulliden and SpinCo, pursuant to the

     2.18   | United States Tax Matters 

  

The transactions set forth in Sections 2.3(l) and 2.3(q) of the Plan of
Arrangement ("Acquisition") are interdependent steps in a single transaction,
to which the parties hereto are legally committed as provided herein, and to
which the parties intend to treat as a single integrated transaction. In
addition, the Parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the "step transaction"
principles under U.S. federal income tax law, the $25,000,000 loan by Rio Alto
to Sulliden under Section 2.3(h) of the Plan, the contribution of such
$25,000,000 in cash or cash and Rio Alto Shares by Sulliden to SpinCo under
Section 2.3(i) of the Plan of Arrangement and the distribution of the SpinCo
Shares to Sulliden Shareholders under Section 2.3(k)(i), will likely be
treated as part of the Acquisition and the SpinCo Shares will likely be
treated as additional consideration paid by Rio Alto to the Sulliden
Shareholders for their Sulliden Shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Acquisition is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ("U.S. Tax Code") and this
Agreement is intended to be a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the U.S. Tax Code.
Provided that the Acquisition meets the requirements of a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code, each party hereto
agrees to treat the Acquisition as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code for all United States federal income tax
purposes, and agrees to treat this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
368 of the U.S. Tax Code, and to not take any position on any Tax Return or
otherwise take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with such treatment,
unless otherwise required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement and in the Plan of Arrangement, each party hereto agrees to act
in a manner that is consistent with the parties\' intention that the
Acquisition be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code for all United States federal income tax purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Rio Alto, Rio Alto Newco or Sulliden
makes any representation, warranty or covenant to any other party or to any
Sulliden Shareholder, holder of Rio Alto Shares or other holder of Sulliden
securities or Rio Alto securities (including, without limitation, stock
options, warrants, debt instruments or other similar rights or instruments)
regarding the U.S. tax treatment of the Acquisition, including, but not
limited to, whether the Acquisition will qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of    
  

  

\- 27 -

  

Section 368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code or as a tax-deferred reorganization for
purposes of any United States state or local income tax law.

     7.1   | SpinCo Indemnity 

  

From the Effective Time, SpinCo hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless
Rio Alto, Sulliden and its Subsidiaries, their affiliates, directors,
officers, partners, employees, advisors, shareholders and agents    
  

  

\- 41 -

  

(each an "Indemnified Party") from all losses suffered or incurred by an
Indemnified Party as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or
in connection with an Indemnified Liability .

         7.2   |   

Indemnified Claims 

---|--- 
        |    

     (a)   |   

If any claim, proceeding, liability (including a liability for Tax) or other
matter resulting from the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by
Subsection 7.1 above (an "Indemnified Claim") is made against an Indemnified
Party by a third party for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall give notice (an "Indemnity
Notice") to SpinCo specifying the particulars of such Indemnified Claim within
20 days after it receives notification of the Indemnified Claim. SpinCo shall
have the right to participate in any negotiations or proceedings with respect
to any such Indemnified Claim. An Indemnified Party shall not settle or
compromise any such Indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of
SpinCo, unless SpinCo has not, within 20 Business Days after the receipt by
SpinCo of the indemnity Notice, given notice to the Indemnified Party that it
wishes to dispute such Indemnified Claim. If SpinCo does give such a notice,
it shall have the right to assume the defence of such Indemnified Claim and to
defend such Indemnified Claim in the name of the Indemnified Party. An
Indemnified Party shall provide to SpinCo all files, books, records and other
information in their possession or control which may be relevant to the
defence of such Indemnified Claim. If SpinCo fails after giving such notice,
diligently and reasonably to defend such Indemnified Claim throughout the
period such Indemnified Claim exists, its right to defend the Indemnified
Claim shall terminate and the Indemnified Party may assume the defence of such
Indemnified Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party may assume the defence
of such Indemnified Claim. In such event, the Indemnified Party may compromise
or settle such Indemnified Claim without the consent of SpinCo. If the
Effective Date occurs, Subsection 7.1 and 7.2 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement for a period of one year from the Effective Date, other than in
the case of an Indemnified Tax Claim, which shall survive for the applicable
statutory period. 

        |    

     (b)   |   

Notwithstanding Subsection  7.2(a): 

        |    

            | (i)   |   

if an Indemnified Claim described in Subsection 7.2(a) includes or would
reasonably be expected to include both a Indemnified Claim for Taxes that are
Indemnified Liabilities (an "Indemnified Tax Claim") and a Indemnified Claim
for Taxes that are not Indemnified Liabilities (an "Unindemnified Tax Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to separate the
defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim from the defence of the Unindemnified Tax
Claim, and in the case of such separation SpinCo shall have the rights
provided in Subsection 7.2(a) in respect of the Indemnified Tax Claim only; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (ii)   |   

if the Indemnified Party is not able to separate the defence of the
Indemnified Tax Claim from the defence of the Unindemnified Tax Claim:

            | A.   |   

the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defence of both such
Indemnified Claims, including the right to settle either or both of such
Indemnified Claims, subject to SpinCo's consent, acting reasonably; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | B.   |   

the Indemnified Party shall act in good faith with a view to the merits in
connection with the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim; and 

        |    |    

        | C.   |   

the Indemnified Party shall afford SpinCo the opportunity to participate in
the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim, provide SpinCo with notice and
access to documentation and information as is reasonable in the circumstances,
otherwise keep SpinCo updated and informed, and consult with SpinCo with
respect to the defence of the Indemnified Tax Claim; 

        |    |       
  

  

\- 42 -

            | (iii)   |   

the Indemnified Party shall provide SpinCo with notice of the resolution of
any Indemnified Tax Claim within 20 days of such resolution; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (iv)   |   

without limiting in any respect the Indemnified Party\'s right to settle any
such Indemnified Claim in its absolute discretion, in the event that SpinCo
objects to a resolution of an Indemnified Tax Claim by delivering notice to
the Indemnified Party within 20 days of receiving the notice set out in (iii),
a neutral nationally recognized accountant (the "Tax Arbitrator") that is
mutually reasonably satisfactory to the parties shall determine the amount, if
any, by which: 

        |    |    

            | A.   |   

the amount of Tax for which the Indemnified Tax Claim was resolved; exceeds 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | B.   |   

the amount of Tax for which the Indemnified Tax Claim could reasonably have
been expected to be resolved if it had been the only matter in dispute; 

        |    |    

            | (v)   |   

if the Tax Arbitrator determines that the amount specified in 7.2(b)(iv)A does
not exceed the amount specified in    7.2(b)(iv)B, SpinCo shall be liable
for: 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

            | A.   |   

pursuant to Subsection 7.1, the Indemnified Tax Claim based on the amount
specified in Subsection 7.2(b)(iv)A; and 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | B.   |   

all costs and expenditures in respect of the arbitration, including the
Indemnified Party\'s reasonable costs; 

        |    |    

            | (vi)   |   

if the Tax Arbitrator determines that the amount specified in Subsection
7.2(b)(iv)A exceeds the amount specified in Subsection 7.2(b)(iv)B 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

            | A.   |   

pursuant to Subsection 7.1, SpinCo shall be liable for the Indemnified Tax
Claim based on the amount specified in Subsection 7.2(b)(iv)B; and 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | B.   |   

the Indemnified Party shall be liable for SpinCo\'s reasonable costs in
respect of the arbitration.

The Sulliden Board may consider, participate in any discussions or
negotiations with and provide information to, any person who has delivered a
written Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited or encouraged by Sulliden
after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Subsection 8.2 by Sulliden and that the Sulliden Board determines in good
faith may reasonably be expected to constitute a Superior Proposal, provided,
however, that if Sulliden provides non-public information to such person, that
Sulliden obtains a confidentiality and standstill agreement from the person
making such Acquisition Proposal that is substantively the same as the
Confidentiality Agreements, and otherwise on terms no more favourable to such
person than such Confidentiality Agreements, including a standstill provision
at least as stringent as contained in the Confidentiality Agreements;
provided, however, that it shall not preclude such Person from making a
Superior Proposal. If Sulliden receives a request for non-public information
from a Person who proposes to make an Acquisition Proposal and the Sulliden
Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, if made, could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and provided that
Sulliden obtains a confidentiality and standstill agreement from the person
making such Acquisition Proposal that is substantially the same as the
Confidentiality Agreements, and otherwise on terms no more favourable to such
Person than such Confidentiality Agreements including a standstill provision
at least as stringent as contained in the Confidentiality Agreements provided,
however, that it shall not preclude such Person from making a Superior
Proposal, Sulliden shall be permitted to provide such Person with access to
non-public information regarding Sulliden; provided that Sulliden sends a copy
of any such confidentiality agreement to Rio Alto promptly upon its execution
and Rio Alto is provided with a list of the non-public information provided to
such Person and is promptly provided with access to similar non-public
information to which such Person was provided.

      | (ii)  |

Nothing contained in this Subsection 8.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Sulliden Board from making a Sulliden Change in Recommendation or
from making any disclosure to the Sulliden Shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Sulliden Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
such action is necessary for the Sulliden Board to act in a manner consistent
with its fiduciary duties or is otherwise required under applicable laws,
provided that in the case of a proposal to make a Sulliden Change in
Recommendation that does not relate to a Superior Proposal, not less than 48
hours before the Sulliden Board considers any such proposal, Sulliden shall
give Rio Alto written notice of such proposal and promptly advise Rio Alto of
the Sulliden Board's intention to consider such proposal and provided further
that the Sulliden Board shall not be entitled to make a Sulliden Change in
Recommendation that results from: (i) an increase in the trading price of the
Sulliden Shares that facilitates or may facilitate an equity financing of
and/or (ii) a change in global credit markets that facilitates or may
facilitate a debt financing of Sulliden.

  
   

The foregoing provisions of this Subsection 8.2(g)(ii) shall not relieve
Sulliden from its obligation to proceed to call and hold the Sulliden Meeting
and to hold the vote on the Sulliden Arrangement Resolution and the Sulliden
Continuance Resolution; except in circumstances where this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

Acquisition Proposal, any discussions or negotiations relating to, or which
Sulliden reasonably believes could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for non- public information relating to Sulliden or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where such disclosure will result in a breach by Sulliden

Agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its discretion in the
exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether the amended proposal would, upon
acceptance by it, be at least equivalent to the Superior Proposal. If the
Sulliden Board so determines, it will enter into an amended agreement with Rio
Alto reflecting the amended proposal. If the Sulliden Board does not so
determine, Sulliden may accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of such Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with 9.2(a)(iv)C hereof.

    (f)  |

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Subsection 9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set
out in this Subsection 9.3 are payments of liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages
will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and
the resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each of
Sulliden and Rio Alto irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a
defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For
greater certainty, each Party agrees that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where Sulliden or Rio Alto is entitled to a
Termination Payment and such Termination Payment is paid in full, Sulliden or
Rio Alto, as the case may be, shall be precluded from any other remedy against
the other Party at Law or in equity or otherwise (including, without

    
 

 

\- 57 -

 

limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall not seek to obtain
any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against the other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective
representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, however, that payment by a Party of a
Termination Payment shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment
or remedy available (including, without limitation, an order for specific
performance) in the event of any wilful or intentional breach by such Party of
any of its obligations under this Agreement.

the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same
as the Sulliden Class A Option for which it was exchanged, and shall be
governed by the terms of the Sulliden Option Plan and any document evidencing
a Sulliden Class A Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence
such Rio Alto Replacement Option, except that the term to expiry of any Rio
Alto Replacement Option shall not be affected by a holder of Rio Alto
Replacement Options not becoming, or ceasing to be, an employee, consultant,
officer or director of Sulliden or Rio Alto, as the case may be. It is
intended that subsection 7(1.4) of Tax Act apply to such exchange of options.

price of a Rio Alto Replacement Option will be increased such that the In-The-
Money Amount of the Rio Alto Replacement Option immediately after the exchange
does not exceed the In-The-Money Amount of the Sulliden Class A Option

Sulliden Warrant shall be entitled to receive (and such holder shall accept)
upon the exercise of such holder\'s Sulliden Warrant, in lieu of Sulliden
Shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon such exercise, and
for the same aggregate consideration payable therefor, the number of Rio Alto
Shares and SpinCo Shares which the holder would have been entitled to receive
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Arrangement if,
immediately prior to the Effective Date, such holder had been the registered
holder of the number of Sulliden Shares to which such holder would have been
entitled if such holder had exercised such holder\'s Sulliden Warrants
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Sulliden Warrant shall continue
to be governed by and be subject to the terms of the applicable Warrant
certificate, subject to any supplemental exercise documents issued by Rio Alto
and SpinCo (as they mutually agree, each acting reasonably) to holders of

exercise, provided that Rio Alto or SpinCo, as applicable, has received the
portion of the Sulliden Warrant exercise price such that the Sulliden Warrant
exercise price is divided between Rio Alto and SpinCo as follows:

        | (a)   |

Rio Alto shall receive a portion of the exercise price equal to the original

a Class A Share divided by the total of the Fair Market Value of a Class A
Share plus the Fair Market Value of one SpinCo Share; and

  
---|---|--- 
      |   |



  
      | (b)   |

      4.1   |

Rights of Dissent

  
---|--- 
   

Nothing in this Plan of Arrangement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall affect, reduce or derogate from the rights of Continuance Dissenting
Shareholders to be paid fair value by Sulliden (or Amalco as its successor)
for their Sulliden Shares under section 378 of the QBCA. A Continuance
Dissenting Shareholder shall not be entitled to exercise Arrangement Dissent
Rights.

 

Holders of Sulliden Shares (other than Continuance Dissenting Shareholders)
may exercise dissent rights ("Arrangement Dissent Rights") in connection with
the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in Section 185 of the
OBCA, as modified by the Interim Order and this Section 4.1; provided that,
notwithstanding subsection 185(6) of the OBCA, the written objection to the
Arrangement Resolution referred to in subsection 185(6) of the OBCA must be
received by Sulliden not later than 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Business
Day immediately preceding the date of the Sulliden Meeting (as it may be
adjourned or postponed from time to time).

 

Dissenting Shareholders who duly exercise their Dissent Rights shall be deemed
to have transferred the Sulliden Shares held by them, and in respect of which
Dissent Rights have been validly exercised, to Rio Alto, free and clear of all
Liens, as provided in Section 2.3(a) above and if they:

        | (a)   |

ultimately are entitled to be paid fair value for such Sulliden Shares, will
be entitled to be paid the fair value by Rio Alto (or by Amalco in the case of
a Continuance Dissenting Shareholder) of such Sulliden Shares, and will not be
entitled to any other payment or consideration, including any payment that
would be payable under the Arrangement had such holders not exercised their
Dissent Rights in respect of such Sulliden Shares; or

  
---|---|--- 
      |   |



  
      | (b)   |

ultimately are not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for such

      |



  
      | (a)   |

In no circumstances shall Rio Alto, Sulliden, Amalco, SpinCo, the Depository
or any other Person be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent
Rights unless such Person is the holder of those Sulliden Shares in respect of
which such rights are sought to be exercised.

  
      |   |



  
      | (b)   |

For greater certainty, in no case shall Rio Alto, Sulliden, Amalco, SpinCo,
the Depository or any other Person be required to recognize Dissenting
Shareholders as Sulliden Shareholders in respect of which Dissent Rights have
been validly exercised after the completion of the transfer under Section
2.3(a) above, and the names of such Dissenting Shareholders shall be removed
from the registers of Sulliden Shareholders in respect of which Dissent Rights
have been validly exercised at the same time as the event described in Section
(a) occurs. In addition to any other restrictions under the OBCA or the QBCA,
as the case may be, none of the following shall be entitled to exercise
Dissent Rights: (i) Sulliden Optionholders, (ii) Sulliden Warrantholders, and
(iii) Sulliden Shareholders who vote or have instructed a proxyholder to vote
such Sulliden Shares in favour of the Contunuance Resolution or Arrangement
Resolution, as the case may be (but only in respect of such Sulliden Shares).
