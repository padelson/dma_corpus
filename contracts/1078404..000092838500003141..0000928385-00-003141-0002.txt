name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent

          2.2  Capital Structure.
               -----------------

               (a)  There are no outstanding commitments to issue any shares of
capital stock or voting securities of Seller other than pursuant to the exercise
of 391,200 options outstanding under the Seller Stock Option Plan. Attached to
or as set forth in Schedule 2.2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a true and
                   ------------
complete list of Seller's stockholders and any persons with rights to acquire
Seller's securities, which list will be promptly updated from time to time prior
to Closing to reflect any changes thereto (which changes are in any event
subject to the restrictions imposed under Section 4.2 below). There are no
subscriptions, options, warrants, exchangeable or convertible securities or
other calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which Seller
is a party or by which it is bound or otherwise obligating Parent or Seller to
issue, transfer, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued,
transferred, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of capital
stock or voting securities of Seller or obligating Seller to grant, extend,
accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into
any such subscription, option, warrant, exchangeable or convertible security or
other call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no contracts, commitments,
voting trusts or agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale of Seller's
capital stock (i) between or among Seller and any of its securityholders, and
(ii) to Seller's knowledge, between or among any of Seller's securityholders.
The terms of the Seller Stock Option Plan and the applicable stock option
agreements permit the assumption or substitution of options to purchase shares
of Buyer's common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Buyer Common Stock"), as
                                                      ------------------
provided in this Agreement, without the consent or approval of the holders of
such securities, the Seller securityholders or otherwise, and all outstanding
options shall, to the extent necessary to waive vesting acceleration, be amended
to modify the exercise schedule and vesting provisions in effect for those
options so as to preclude any accelerated vesting or exercisability of those
options by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. True and
complete copies of all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under
the Seller Stock Option Plan have been provided to Buyer and such agreements and
instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no
agreements to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or instruments in any
case from the form provided to Buyer. All outstanding shares of capital stock
and other voting securities of Seller were issued in compliance with all
applicable laws.

               (b)  Each of the Seller stockholders and/or optionholders is the
registered and beneficial owner of that number of Seller Shares and/or Seller
Options set forth opposite its name in the Spreadsheet (as defined in Section
5.14 hereof). The number of Seller Shares and/or Seller Options set forth
opposite such person's name in the Spreadsheet constitutes the entire interest
of such person in the outstanding capital stock or voting securities of Seller.
No other person or entity not disclosed in the Spreadsheet has a beneficial
interest in or a right to acquire any Seller capital stock or Seller Options. In
addition, the shares of Seller capital stock and/or Seller Options disclosed in
the Spreadsheet are and will, at all times during the term of this Agreement and
through and including the Closing, be free and clear of any Liens.

Seller do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default under (with or

decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Seller or any
of its properties or assets. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or

respective directors or officers (in their capacities as such), that could
reasonably be expected to prevent, enjoin, or materially alter or delay any of

Adverse Effect on the Business. Each of the Seller Authorizations is assignable
or otherwise transferable to Buyer in connection with the transactions

or other third party, except where such failure could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.

                                  -------------
Schedule identifies each parcel of real property owned or leased by Seller or
used in the operation of the Business or where any Assets are located, the name
of the lessor, the date of the lease and each amendment thereto and the
aggregate annual rental and other fees payable under such lease. Such leases are
in good standing, are binding, valid and enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, and there is not under any such leases any existing default or
event of default (or event which with or without the giving of notice or lapse
of time would constitute such a default). After the Closing Date, Buyer will be

statutory liens for taxes not yet due (none of which statutory liens shall be
the obligation of Buyer). Affiliate has full right and power to sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and by virtue of the deliveries made at
Closing, Buyer will obtain from Affiliate, good and marketable title to all of
the Assets, other than the Assets held by Seller, free and clear of any and all

right or restriction, are in good operating condition and repair, reasonable
wear and tear excepted, and are suitable and adequate for the purposes for which
such Assets are currently used or held for use, and conform in all material

service providers and/or payment to the tax authorities of withholding taxes or
other dues with respect to their rendering of services to such member. No member
of Seller's Group has been notified that any investigation is being conducted
against any member of Seller's Group by any tax authority with respect to any of

contain a complete and accurate summary of all meetings of directors and
stockholders or actions by written consent since the time of incorporation of
Seller through the date of this Agreement, and reflect all transactions referred
to in such minutes accurately in all material respects.

          2.21  Complete Copies of Materials. Each of Parent, Affiliate and
                ----------------------------
Seller has delivered or made available true and complete copies of each document
that has been requested by Buyer or its counsel in connection with their legal
and accounting review of the Business or the Assets.

          2.22  Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Except for Morgan Stanley & Co.
                --------------------------
Incorporated (whose fees shall be paid by Seller or Parent), neither Seller nor

for brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions or investment bankers'
fees or any similar charges in connection with this Agreement or any
transactions contemplated hereby.

          2.23  Vote Required. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of
                -------------

          2.25  Inventory. The inventories relating to the Business shown on the
                ---------
Financial Statements or thereafter acquired by Seller consisted of items of a
quantity and quality usable or salable in the ordinary course of business. Since
the Seller Balance Sheet Date, Seller has continued to replenish inventories
relating to the Business in a normal and customary manner consistent with past
practices. Seller has not received written or oral notice that it will
experience in the foreseeable future any difficulty in obtaining, in the desired
quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and upon reasonable terms and
conditions, the raw materials, supplies or component products required for the
manufacture, assembly or production of its

                                       18
<PAGE>

products relating to the Business. The values at which inventories relating to
the Business are carried reflect the inventory valuation policy of Seller, which
is consistent with its past practice and in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. Since the Balance Sheet
Date, due provision was made on the books of Seller in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices to provide for all slow-moving,
obsolete, or unusable inventories relating to the Business to their estimated
useful or scrap values and such inventory reserves are adequate to provide for
such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory and inventory shrinkage. As of
the date hereof, Seller has no inventory relating to the Business in the
distribution channel or any commitments to purchase inventory. Schedule 2.25 of
                                                               -------------

                -------------------
Financial Statements, the accounts receivable relating to the Business shown on
the Financial Statements represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales
and other charges, are valid receivables subject to no defenses, offsets or
counterclaims, are current and collectible, and are not subject to discount
except for normal cash and immaterial trade discounts. The amount carried for
doubtful accounts and allowances relating to the Business disclosed in the
Financial Statements was calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and in a manner consistent with prior periods is
sufficient to provide for any losses which may be sustained on realization of
the receivables.

          2.27  Customers and Suppliers. No customer of the Business that
                -----------------------
individually accounted for more than one percent (1%) of Seller's consolidated
gross revenues during the twelve (12) month period preceding the date hereof,
and no supplier of the Business has canceled or otherwise terminated, or made
any written threat to Seller to cancel or otherwise terminate its relationship
with Seller relating to the Business, or has decreased materially its services
or supplies to Seller, in the case of any such supplier, or its usage of the
services or products of Seller, in the case of such customer, and, to Seller's
knowledge, no such supplier or customer intends to cancel or otherwise terminate
its relationship with Seller or to decrease materially its services or supplies
to Seller or its usage of the services or products of Seller. Seller has not
knowingly breached, so as to provide a benefit to Seller that was not intended
by the parties, any agreement with, or engaged in any fraudulent conduct with
respect to, any customer or supplier of the Business.

effect, unamended, and there exists no default or event of default or event,
occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Seller or Affiliate or to Seller's
or Affiliate's knowledge, as applicable, with respect to the other contracting
party, which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of

                -----------------------------  -------------

material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to operate the Business in the same

          5.6  Employee Benefit Plan; Assumption of Options. At the Closing, the
               --------------------------------------------
Seller Stock Option Plan, and each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Seller capital stock under the Seller Stock Option Plan, whether vested or
unvested, will be assumed by Buyer. Schedule 5.6 of the Seller Disclosure
                                    ------------
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list as of the date hereof of all
holders of outstanding options under the Seller Stock Option Plan including the
number of shares of Seller capital stock subject to each such option, the
exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each
such option. On the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an updated
Schedule 5.6 current as of such date. Each such option so assumed by Buyer under
------------
this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Seller Stock Option Plan and the applicable stock
option agreement immediately prior to the Closing, except that (a) such option
will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal
to the product of the number of shares of Seller capital stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Closing Date
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as defined in this Section 5.6) and rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, and (b) the
per share exercise price for the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Seller capital stock at which such
option was exercisable immediately prior to the Closing by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Consistent with the terms of the Seller
Stock Option Plan and the documents governing the outstanding options under such
Plan, the Acquisition will not terminate any of the outstanding options under
the Seller Stock Option Plan or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such
options or the shares of Buyer Common Stock which will be subject to those
options upon the Buyer's assumption of the options in the Acquisition. After the
Closing, within thirty (30) business days after Buyer's receipt of the
Spreadsheet, Buyer will issue to each person who, immediately prior to the
Closing was a holder of an outstanding option under the Seller Stock Option
Plan, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by Buyer.
For purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" shall mean $60 divided by
                                     --------------
the average closing price of Buyer Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Stock
Market for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding and ending on the
trading day that is three (3) trading days prior to the Closing Date. The
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Seller Common Stock effective after
the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date.

          5.7  Escrow Agreement. On or before the Closing, the Escrow Agent,

Buyer in entering into such an agreement with such employees. Buyer shall have

those listed on Schedule 5.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
                ------------

               (b)  Termination and Severance Payments. At or prior to the
                    ----------------------------------
Closing, Seller shall pay, discharge and satisfy in full any and all severance
benefits and obligations, under applicable law or otherwise, relating to the
termination of employment, or reemployment by Buyer or its affiliates, of each
employee of Seller, and shall deliver to Buyer evidence in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer of the discharge of such severance benefits and
obligations. The Seller hereby agrees to indemnify Buyer in full for any and all
severance benefits and obligations of Seller with respect to any such employees.

          5.9  Expenses. Whether or not the Acquisition is consummated, all
               --------
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense; provided, however that if the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, Buyer shall bear up to $100,000 of the fees and expenses
(including any fees and expenses of legal counsel, financial advisors,
investment bankers and accountants) incurred in the aggregate by Seller and
Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Any fees and expenses incurred by Seller in excess of $100,000
(including any fees and expenses of legal counsel, financial advisors,
investment bankers and accountants) (collectively, the "Seller Expenses") and
                                                        ---------------
any Transfer Taxes shall remain an obligation of Parent and Seller. If Buyer
receives any invoices for amounts in excess of $100,000 for such fees and
expenses or for Transfer Taxes, Seller and Parent shall promptly pay such fees
and/or expenses or Transfer Taxes; provided, however, that such payment shall,
if not promptly reimbursed by Parent or Seller, constitute "Damages" recoverable
                                                            -------
under the Escrow Agreement and such Damages shall not be subject to the Escrow
Basket.

          5.10 Reasonable Best Efforts and Further Assurances. Each of the
               ----------------------------------------------
parties to this Agreement shall use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate
the transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill and cause to be fulfilled
the conditions to closing under this Agreement. Each party hereto, at the
reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or
desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. If Seller, Affiliate, Parent or Buyer is
unable to obtain, prior to Closing, any consents, approvals, waivers or other
authorizations to transfer to Buyer any Asset, Seller, Affiliate, Parent and
Buyer shall cooperate with one another in order to obtain such consents,
approvals, waivers or other authorizations at the earliest practicable date. In
each instance where such consents, approvals, waivers or other authorizations
cannot be obtained prior to the Closing, each of Seller, Affiliate and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into such alternative
arrangements and agreements with Buyer as may be appropriate in the reasonable
judgment of Parent and Buyer in order to permit Buyer to realize, receive and
enjoy substantially similar rights and benefits and to enable Buyer to conduct
operations of the Business until the consents, approvals, waivers or other
authorizations are obtained. If, after the exercise of diligent effort, any such
consents, approvals, waivers or other authorizations are not obtained, each of
Seller and Parent agrees to cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable arrangements
designed to provide, to the extent reasonably practicable, for the benefit of
Buyer, any and all rights of Seller in and to such Asset.

anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer,
Seller and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates to:

                    (i)   Enter into or engage, directly or indirectly, in the
business of creating, developing, selling or licensing computer network server
software for broadband subscriber management (the "Specified Technology"),
                                                   --------------------
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall directly or indirectly
prohibit Seller or Parent from (1) continuing the Existing Business, (2) using
in connection with any of the Existing Businesses any product, software or
technology acquired from or through any third party (whether by license,
assignment, transfer of assets or stock, merger or acquisition of all or part of
a business, or joint development) or created, invented, designed, or developed
by or on behalf of Seller or Parent, or (3) purchasing or owning equity
securities of any issuer if those securities constitute less than two percent
(2%) in the aggregate of the class of equity securities of such issuer and such
class of securities are registered under the Securities Act;

                    (ii)  Solicit customers, suppliers, or business patronage
which results in competition by Parent or Seller, on the one hand, with Buyer or
any of its affiliates, on the other hand, in the Specified Technology;

or any of its affiliates to leave the employment of Buyer or any of its

commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its affiliates and each

of Seller and its affiliates to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to
disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of law,
all proprietary, non-public and other confidential documents and information
concerning the Assets; provided that, without in any way limiting the foregoing
obligations, Seller, Affiliate and Parent may disclose such information to its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and
agents solely for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so
long as such persons are informed by Seller, Affiliate or Parent of the
confidential nature of such information and are directed by Seller, Affiliate or
Parent to treat such information confidentially; and further provided that the
obligations of Seller, Affiliate and Parent hereunder shall not apply to
information that (i) becomes publicly available or available to any third party
other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or Parent or any of their
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors; (ii) is

               (c)  Without limitation, the parties agree and intend that the
covenants contained in this Section 5.11 shall be deemed to be a series of
separate covenants and agreements, one for each and every political subdivision
of each jurisdiction. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce in such action any of the separate covenants deemed included herein,
then at the option of the party hereto entitled to the benefit of such
covenants, wholly unenforceable covenants or components thereof shall be deemed
eliminated from the provisions hereof for the purpose of such proceeding to the
extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in
such a proceeding. The parties intend to have covenants enforceable to the
fullest extent of the law as to scope, time and geography.

               (d)  The parties agree that due to the unique nature of the
services and capabilities of Seller and Parent, there can be no adequate remedy
at law for any breach of the obligations of Seller and Parent hereunder, that
any such breach by Seller or Parent may allow the other party hereto and/or
third parties to unfairly compete with Buyer and its affiliates resulting in
irreparable harm to Buyer and therefore, that upon any such breach by Seller or
Parent or any threat thereof, Buyer and its affiliates shall be entitled to
appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at
law. Further, Buyer and its affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification by
Seller and Parent from any loss or harm, including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, including attorneys' fees on appeal, and costs of suit, in
connection with any breach, or any enforcement, of its obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.11.

               (e)  Each of Seller and Parent acknowledges, represents and
warrants to Buyer that the covenants of Seller and Parent in this Section 5.11
are reasonably necessary for the protection of Buyer's interests under this
Agreement and are not unduly restrictive upon Seller, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates.

               (f)  Seller, Affiliate and Parent shall notify Buyer of any
breach or alleged breach by Seller, Affiliate or Parent, as the case may be, of
any provision of this Section 5.11 and, within thirty (30) days after the date
of mailing of such notice or becoming aware of such breach or alleged breach,
Seller, Affiliate or Parent, as the case may be, shall cure such breach or
alleged breach. Failure to cure such breach or alleged breach to Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction within such time period shall constitute a default under
this Agreement and Buyer shall be entitled to exercise any of its available
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section
5.11(c)).

          5.12 Form S-8. Buyer agrees to file, after the Closing, no later than

option documentation relating to all options outstanding under the Seller Stock
Option Plan as of the Closing Date), a registration statement on Form S-8
covering the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to all outstanding
options under the Seller Stock Option Plan assumed by Buyer, provided that such
options qualify for registration on such Form S-8. Seller shall cooperate with
and assist Buyer in the preparation of such registration statement.

          5.13 Listing of Additional Shares. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
               ----------------------------

Additional Shares with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the options and rights under the Seller Stock Option Plan assumed by
Buyer hereunder.

certified as complete and correct by a duly elected officer of Seller, at the
Closing.

          5.15 Bulk Sales Laws. Each of Seller, Parent, Affiliate and Buyer
               ---------------
hereby waives compliance by the other with all "bulk sales" laws and any other
                                                ----------

person, if any, who controls or may control Buyer within the meaning of the

                                                                     -----
Damages"), arising out of (i) any misrepresentation or breach in connection with
-------
any of the representations or warranties given or made by Seller, Affiliate or
Parent in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any exhibit or
schedule to this Agreement; (ii) any default in connection with any of the
covenants or agreements given or made by Seller, Affiliate or Parent in this
Agreement or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement; (iii) any liabilities or
obligations relating to Seller, Affiliate or Parent other than the Assumed
Liabilities; (iv) any Intellectual Property Matters (as defined in a letter

forth on Schedule 2.6 or Schedule 2.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

directors, agents and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may
control Seller or Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act (hereinafter
referred to individually as a "Buyer Indemnified Person" and collectively as
                               ------------------------
"Buyer Indemnified Persons" and, together with Seller Indemnified Persons,
 -------------------------
"Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all losses, costs, damages,

the Purchase Price. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of
Seller or Parent for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if
the Acquisition does not close.

Certificate or Certificates (as defined in Section 8.5 hereof) has been
delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.5 below (i) identifying
Buyer Damages and (ii) solely in the case of Section 8.2(a)(i), specifying that
the aggregate amount of such Buyer Damages exceeds $100,000, provided, however,

Damages arise by reason of Section 2.13 and shall not be interpreted to include
any obligations arising under Section 5.17, and (b) such amount is determined
pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable, in which case Buyer shall receive
an amount equal in value to the full amount of Buyer Damages. For purposes of
this Section 8.3, in determining the amount of any Damage resulting from any

default has occurred, any materiality standard contained in the applicable
representation, warranty or covenant shall be disregarded.

               (a)  A portion of the Escrow Amount equal to $15,000,000 (the
"Initial Escrow Amount"), plus any interest or earnings on the Initial Escrow
 ---------------------
Amount, less any payments made from the Escrow Fund, shall remain in the Escrow
Fund for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (the

                                                  ------
Escrow Agent (the "Special Escrow Period"); provided, however, that a portion of

necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's
Certificate theretofore delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of

(an "Officer's Certificate") :
     ---------------------

                    (i)  stating that Buyer Damages exist and, solely in the
case of Section 8.2(a)(i), specifying that such Buyer Damages are in an
aggregate amount greater than $100,000; and

                                       43
<PAGE>

                    (ii)  specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of such Buyer Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item
was paid, or properly accrued or arose, the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or claim to which such item is related;

the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 8.6 and 8.7 below,
deliver to Buyer out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, a portion
of the Initial Escrow Amount (and/or interest or earnings thereon) having a
value equal to such Buyer Damages.

               (b)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent, on or before the last day
of the Special Escrow Period, of an Officer's Certificate:

                    (i)  stating that Buyer Damages under Section 8.2(a)(iv)
exist; and

                    (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
such Buyer Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
paid, or properly accrued or arose, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
of warranty or claim to which such item is related;

the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 8.6 and 8.7 below,
deliver to Buyer out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, a portion
of the Special Escrow Amount (and/or interest or earnings thereon) having a
value equal to such Buyer Damages.

          8.6  Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
               --------------------
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, duplicate copies of such Officer's Certificate
shall be delivered to Seller and Parent and for a period of forty-five (45) days
after such delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Officer's Certificate, the
Escrow Agent shall make no payments from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.5
hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from
Seller and Parent to make such payments. After the expiration of such forty-five
(45) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make payments from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 8.5 hereof, provided that no such payment may be made if
Seller or Parent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the
Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent and to Buyer prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day
period.

          8.7  Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.
               ------------------------------------

               (a)  In case Seller or Parent shall so object in writing to any
claim or claims by Buyer made in any Officer's Certificate, Buyer shall have
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of an objection by Seller
or Parent to respond in a written statement to the objection of Seller. If after
such forty-five (45) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, Seller
and Buyer shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If Seller,
Parent and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to

                                       44
<PAGE>

rely on any such memorandum and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund
in accordance with the terms thereof.

               (b)  If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Buyer, Parent or Seller may, by written notice to the other,
demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at
issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall
not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written
notice is sent, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller and Parent, on the other
hand, shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected
shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything
in Section 8.6 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance
with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in
accordance therewith.

               (c)  Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Santa Clara or San Mateo County, California under the commercial rules then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section
8.7(c), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof
stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue, Buyer shall be deemed to be the
Non-Prevailing Party unless the arbitrators award Buyer more than one-half (1/2)
of the amount in dispute, plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the Seller
shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses,
including without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs, reasonably incurred by
the other party to the arbitration.

          8.8  Third-Party Claims. In the event Buyer becomes aware of a third-
               ------------------
party claim which Buyer believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such claim, and Seller and Parent shall be
entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim. Buyer
may not effect the settlement of any such claim without the consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that Seller has
consented to any such settlement, Seller shall have no power or authority to
object under Section 8.6 or any other provision of this Article VIII to the
amount of any claim by Buyer against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect
to such settlement.

                                  ARTICLE IX

                              GENERAL PROVISIONS

               -------------------------------
warranties set forth in Articles II and III, other than the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.11(j), will survive until the first
anniversary of the Closing. The representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.11(j) will survive the Closing for the duration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

          9.6  Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,

Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably

               -------------------

               -------------
in accordance with the laws of California without reference to such state's
principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court located within the State of
California, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served
upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of California for
such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which
they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.

          9.9  Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have
               ---------------------
been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of

holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.
