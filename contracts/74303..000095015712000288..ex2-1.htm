STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of July 17, 2012
by and among Olin Corporation, a Virginia corporation ("Purchaser"), K. A.
Steel Chemicals Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), each of the
stockholders of the Company (each a "Seller" and collectively, "Sellers"), and
Robert F. Steel, an individual residing in the State of Illinois, as agent for
Sellers (the "Seller Representative").

  

  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

  

  

Sellers collectively own all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company. Purchaser desires to purchase all of such Shares owned
by Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell all of their Shares to Purchaser, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions herein contained.

  

  

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
employees of the Company set forth on Section 1.0 of the Disclosure Letter
shall have executed an employment agreement providing for the employment of
such employee by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Target Companies,
as owned by Purchaser post-Closing) effective as of Closing (the "Employment
Agreements").

  

  

AGREEMENTS

  

  

In consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valid
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION

  

  

 

SECTION 1.1 Defined Terms. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
have the definitions set forth in the body of this Agreement. Any capitalized
terms used in this Agreement and not defined in the body have the meanings
assigned to such terms on Schedule A.

  

  

SECTION 1.2 Certain References. Any reference in this Agreement to a statute
refers to the statute, any amendments or successor legislation, and all
regulations promulgated thereunder, as in effect at the relevant time. Any
reference to a contract, instrument or other document as of a given date means
the contract, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and
modified from time to time through such date. All article, section, paragraph,
subparagraph, clause, exhibit and schedule references are to the articles,
sections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, exhibits and schedules of or to
this Agreement unless otherwise specified. All references herein to "dollars"
or "$" are to United States dollars. All references herein to any period of

parties to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 1.3 Rules of Construction. Words in the singular shall be held to
include the plural and vice versa. Words of one gender shall be held to
include the other genders as the context requires. The terms "hereof,"
"herein," "hereunder," "hereto" and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" and

accordance with GAAP, and all financial computations hereunder will be
computed, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, in accordance with
GAAP. Any reference herein to the Seller Representative shall be to Robert F.

SECTION 1.4 Preparation of Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that
each has negotiated and reviewed the terms of this Agreement, assisted by such
legal and tax counsel, and other advisors as they desired, and has contributed
to its revisions. The parties further agree that the rule of construction that
any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting party shall be subordinated

SECTION 2.1 Agreement to Purchase and Sell Shares. On the terms and subject to
the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, each Seller shall
sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase, acquire and accept from each Seller, all of the Shares owned by such
Seller, as set forth on Section 2.1 to the Disclosure Letter.

  

  

SECTION 2.2 Consideration. As consideration for the purchase of the Shares,
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to:

  

  

(a) $328,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"); plus

  

  

(b) the Working Capital Adjustment (if positive), or minus the Working Capital
Adjustment (if negative); minus

  

  

(c) the Closing Incentive Amount; minus

  

  

(d) the aggregate amount of indebtedness for borrowed money of Sellers or the
Incentive Employee owed to the Target Companies (and any other indebtedness of
Sellers or the Incentive Employee that is evidenced by a note, bond, debenture
or similar instrument in favor of the Target Companies) existing immediately
prior to the Closing ("Seller Indebtedness"), if any; minus

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) the amount required at Closing to discharge in full the Indebtedness of
the Target Companies existing immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing
Indebtedness"); minus

  

  

(f) the amount required at Closing to discharge in full the Transaction
Expenses (such net amount being referred to herein as the "Aggregate
Consideration").

  

  

SECTION 2.3 Closing and Closing Payments.

  

  

(a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated (the
"Closing") at 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date specified by the parties, which
date shall be no later than two (2) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article IX (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at the offices of
Reed Smith LLP, 10 S. Wacker Drive, 40th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Closing Date".

  

  

(b) Two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller Representative
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a written certificate (the "Closing
Estimate Statement") setting forth the Seller Representative's good faith
estimate of the Aggregate Consideration (including the components of each of
the elements thereof) as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Closing Estimate Payment") based upon the most recent ascertainable financial
information of the Target Companies and prepared by the Seller Representative
in accordance with GAAP and the accounting principles and procedures set forth
on Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Letter (the "Working Capital Methodology").
The Seller Representative shall provide to Purchaser and its representatives
any information and back-up materials (including bank account information)
reasonably requested by Purchaser with respect to the Closing Estimate
Statement. The final Aggregate Consideration shall be determined, and any
necessary adjustment payments shall be made, following the Closing in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.

  

  

(c) Subject to the delivery of the items set forth in Section 2.7(b), at the
Closing, Purchaser shall make the following payments indicated below:

  

  

(i) amounts sufficient to pay in full all of the Closing Indebtedness in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Payoff Letters provided to the
parties hereto on or prior to the Closing by the lenders of such Closing
Indebtedness;

  

  

(ii) an amount sufficient to pay in full the Closing Incentive Amount, which
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Company
to a bank account designated by the Company by written notice to Purchaser at
least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date or otherwise paid as
contemplated by the definition of Closing Incentive Amount;

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(iii) the Transaction Expenses set forth in the Transaction Invoices, in
accordance with the wire transfer instructions set forth in such Transaction
Invoices;

  

  

(iv) $30,000,000 of the Closing Estimate Payment (the "Escrow Amount") shall
be deposited with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (together with its successors and
permitted assigns, the "Escrow Agent"), to be held by the Escrow Agent in an
account (the "Escrow Account") and invested and distributed by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement to be
entered into as of the Closing by Purchaser, the Seller Representative and the
Escrow Agent in substantially the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (as
amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof, the "Escrow Agreement");

  

  

(v) $3,000,000 of the Closing Estimate Payment shall be deposited with the
Escrow Agent, to be held by the Escrow Agent in an account (the "Additional
Escrow Account") and invested and distributed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Additional Escrow Agreement; and

  

  

(vi) the remainder of the Closing Estimate Payment shall be delivered to
Sellers, in accordance with their respective interests in the Company as set
forth on Section 2.1 to the Disclosure Letter, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank accounts designated by the Seller Representative
by written notice to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days before the
Closing Date.

  

  

SECTION 2.4 Aggregate Consideration Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, the Aggregate Consideration shall be finally
determined in accordance with the adjustments and procedures set forth in
Sections 2.5 and 2.6. If the Aggregate Consideration (as finally determined)
is greater than the Closing Estimate Payment, an amount equal to the excess of
the Aggregate Consideration over the Closing Estimate Payment shall be paid by
Purchaser to the Seller Representative, on behalf of Sellers, within two (2)
Business Days following the final determination of the Aggregate
Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated by the Seller Representative. The Seller Representative
shall promptly thereafter deliver to each Seller its share of such payment in
accordance with their respective interests in the Company as set forth on
Section 2.1 of the Disclosure Letter. If the Aggregate Consideration (as
finally determined) is less than the Closing Estimate Payment (a
"Deficiency"), the Deficiency shall be paid out of the Escrow Account, on
behalf of Sellers, to Purchaser promptly following the final determination of
the Aggregate Consideration. To the extent the amount then remaining in the
Escrow Account is insufficient to satisfy the Deficiency, the positive
difference between the Deficiency and the amount then remaining in the Escrow
Account shall be paid by the Seller Representative (on behalf of Sellers) to
Purchaser promptly following the final determination of the Aggregate
Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or

(b) The parties shall give effect to the actions set forth in Section 2.4(b)
of the Disclosure Letter.

SECTION 2.5 Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet. The amount of Working
Capital, Seller Indebtedness, Closing Incentive Amount, Closing Indebtedness
and Transaction Expenses included in the calculation of the Aggregate
Consideration shall be determined from a consolidated balance sheet of the
Target Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing
Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Purchaser in
accordance with GAAP and the accounting principles and procedures set forth in
the Working Capital Methodology. Purchaser shall provide to the Seller
Representative any information and back-up materials (including bank account
information) reasonably requested by the Seller Representative with respect to
the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event of any conflict between GAAP and the
Working Capital Methodology, the Working Capital Methodology shall control.
Purchaser shall deliver Purchaser's calculation of the Aggregate Consideration
(including the components of each of the elements thereof) and the Closing
Balance Sheet to the Seller Representative on or before the date sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date.

  

  

SECTION 2.6 Disputes Regarding Closing Balance Sheet.

  

  

(a) The Seller Representative shall have from the time the Closing Balance
Sheet is delivered to it until 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the date thirty
(30) days after the date of such delivery (the "Dispute Period") to dispute
any elements of or amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet that affect
the calculation of the Aggregate Consideration (the "Dispute"), but only on
the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet are
inaccurate or do not conform to GAAP and the accounting principles and
procedures set forth in the Working Capital Methodology. If the Seller
Representative does not deliver to Purchaser within the Dispute Period a
written notice of the Dispute that sets forth in reasonable detail the
elements and amounts with which the Seller Representative disagrees (a
"Dispute Notice"), the Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed to have been
accepted and agreed to by the Seller Representative in the form in which it
was delivered to the Seller Representative and shall be final and binding upon
the parties. If the Seller Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to
Purchaser within the Dispute Period, Purchaser and the Seller Representative
shall attempt to resolve the Dispute and agree in writing upon the final
content of the disputed Closing Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days after
delivery of such Dispute Notice.

  

  

(b) If Purchaser and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve each
element of the Dispute within the thirty (30) day period after Purchaser's
receipt of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall
jointly engage Ernst and Young LLP, or, if such firm declines to be retained to
resolve the Dispute, another nationally recognized, independent accounting
firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Seller Representative (in
either case, the "Arbitrating Accountant"). The Arbitrating Accountant's
function shall be to resolve each element of the Dispute that has not been
resolved by Purchaser and the Seller Representative, to revise the Closing
Balance Sheet to reflect such resolutions and to calculate the Aggregate
Consideration based on the elements and amounts reflected on the revised
Closing Balance Sheet.

  

  

(c) In connection with the resolution of the Dispute, the Arbitrating
Accountant shall allow Purchaser and the Seller Representative to present
their respective positions regarding the elements and amounts of the Closing
Balance Sheet in dispute. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the Dispute, at which conference Purchaser and
the Seller Representative shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to have present their
respective counsel, accountants and other advisors. In connection with the
resolution of the Dispute, there shall be no other hearings or oral
examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings.
Each of Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall make available to the
other party and the Arbitrating Accountant, as the case may be, such
documents, books, records, work papers, facilities, personnel and other
information as such party or the Arbitrating Accountant may reasonably request
to review the Closing Balance Sheet and to resolve the Dispute.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) The Arbitrating Accountant shall as promptly as possible, and in any event
within thirty (30) days after the date of its appointment, render its decision
on each element in the Dispute in writing to Purchaser and the Seller
Representative, together with a revised Closing Balance Sheet reflecting its
decision and a revised calculation of the Aggregate Consideration based on the
elements and amounts reflected on the revised Closing Balance Sheet. In
resolving the Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant shall be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement and may not revise any element of the Closing
Balance Sheet that is not contested in the Dispute Notice or assign a value to
any disputed element of the Closing Balance Sheet greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. Each of the Arbitrating Accountant's
decision, the revised Closing Balance Sheet and the revised calculation of the
Aggregate Consideration shall be final and binding upon the parties. The
Arbitrating Accountant's fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the
Seller Representative, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand.

and identified as the "Disclosure Letter", which shall be arranged with
specific reference to the appropriate section (and, if applicable, subsection)

Letter shall be deemed to be referred to and incorporated in all other
sections of the Disclosure Letter to which such matter's application or
relevance to a representation or warranty in any other section of this

Disclosure Letter is not evidence of the materiality of such item for purposes
of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 3.1 Organization and Existence. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Letter
lists each of the Target Companies, together with its jurisdiction of

as a foreign corporation (or other applicable organization) and is in good
standing (where applicable) in all jurisdictions where the nature of its
business or the nature and location of its assets requires such qualification
and where the failures to so qualify, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.3 Authorization; Enforceability. The execution, delivery, and

obligations thereunder. The Transaction Documents to which the Company is
party will be duly executed and delivered by the Company at the Closing
(except for this Agreement, which has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company on the date hereof), and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto, will constitute, upon
such execution and delivery in each case thereof, legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, except to the extent enforcement may be affected by Laws relating to
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and creditors' rights and by the
availability of injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable
remedies.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 No Violation. Except as required under the HSR Act and except as
otherwise provided in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Letter, neither the
execution and delivery of each Transaction Document to which a Target Company

contemplated thereby (with or without notice or lapse of time or both), will
conflict with, violate, breach, result in a default or modification of rights,
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration, result in the creation of any Lien, or require any notice or
consent under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Material
Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any

SECTION 3.5 Conflicts under Constituent Documents. Except as required under
the HSR Act, neither the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents

Company's Governing Documents, or of any statute or administrative
regulations, or of any Order or authorization of, or registration or filing
with, any Governmental Authority, or of any arbitration award, to which any
Target Company is party or by which any Target Company is bound.

stock or other equity interests of any Target Company of any class authorized,
issued or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding Shares have been

for the years ended 2011 and 2010 (the "Financial Statements"), are contained
in Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Letter. Copies of the consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows of the Target Companies as of and for the five-month period ended on May
31, 2012 (such financial statements, the "Interim Financial Statements"), are
also contained in Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Letter. The Financial
Statements and the Interim Financial Statements were derived from the books
and records of the Target Companies and present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Target Companies as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations, changes in cash
flows and stockholders' equity of the Target Companies for the periods covered
by such statements, and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied through the periods covered thereby, except as disclosed
therein, and, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, except for: (i)
normal and customary year-end adjustments and (ii) the omission of footnote
disclosures required by GAAP.

  

  

(b) The Target Companies' system of internal controls over financial reporting
is sufficient (i) to permit, in all material respects, the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) to ensure that material
transactions are executed with management oversight and authorization, as
applicable and (iii) to prevent or timely detect the unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the material assets of the Target Companies.

SECTION 3.8 Title and Condition of Assets. The assets of the Target Companies:
(a) include all of the assets that are used in the operation of the Business
as presently conducted (b) are adequate to conduct the Business as presently
conducted and (c) will be adequate to enable Purchaser to continue to conduct
the Business as presently conducted. Except as set forth on Section 3.8 of the
Disclosure Letter, (i) each Target Company has good and valid title to its
material assets, free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens and
(ii) none of the assets or property that is used in the operation of the
Business as presently conducted is owned by any Seller. The machinery,
equipment and other tangible assets of the Target Companies currently used in
the operation of the Business have been maintained in accordance with industry
practice and are in good operating condition, subject to ordinary wear and
tear. The foregoing representation and warranty shall not apply to the
inventory of the Target Companies, which is dealt with in Section 3.9, the
Real Property, which is dealt with in Section 3.17, or the Intellectual
Property of the Target Companies, which is dealt with in Section 3.19.

  

  

SECTION 3.9 Inventory. The inventory reflected on the Interim Financial
Statements is current, merchantable, usable and salable in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with the past practice of the Target Companies. All
reserves, allowances and discounts with respect to any inventory of the Target
Companies were established in accordance with GAAP and consistent with the
reserves, allowances and discounts previously maintained by the Target
Companies with respect to such inventory in the ordinary course of business.
The inventory reflected on the Interim Financial Statements is valued at the
lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined using the last
in, first out accounting method. Since the date of the Interim Financial
Statements, there have not been any material write-downs of the value of, or
establishment of any material reserves against, any inventory of the Target
Companies except in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice.

  

  

SECTION 3.10 Accounts Receivable. To the Company's knowledge, all of the
Accounts Receivable have arisen from bona fide transactions by the Target
Companies in the ordinary course of business. None of the Accounts Receivable
is subject to any material counterclaim or setoff. Since the date of the
Interim Financial Statements, there have not been any material write-downs of
the value of, or establishment of any material reserves against, any Accounts
Receivable except in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice.

  

  

SECTION 3.11 Taxes.

  

  

(a) Each of the Target Companies has filed all federal, state, local and
foreign income, information and other Tax Returns that were required to be
filed by them on or prior to the Closing Date whose statute of limitations has
not expired. All such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material
respects. No material issues are currently pending with any Governmental
Authority with respect to any such Tax Return, and except as set forth on
Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter, no extension of time to file any
such Tax Return has been requested from or granted by any Governmental
Authority.

due and owing on all Tax Returns that were required to be filed by them on or
prior to the Closing Date and whose statute of limitations has not expired,
other than Taxes that are not yet due and payable and Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by any of the Target Companies. To the extent required
by GAAP, the Interim Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all
Taxes payable by the Target Companies for all taxable periods thereof through
the date of the Interim Financial Statements.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(c) of the Disclosure Letter, no Target
Company has been the subject of any audit or investigation by any Governmental
Authority with respect to any taxable periods or portions of periods ending on
or before the Closing Date whose statute of limitations has not expired. No
written notice has been received by any Target Company from any Governmental
Authority that an audit, examination or other administrative or court
Proceeding involving Taxes of the Target Companies is contemplated or pending.
No waivers of statutes of limitation with respect to the Taxes or Tax Returns
of any of the Target Companies have been given by or requested from any of the
Target Companies with respect to any taxable periods or portions of periods
ending on or before the Closing Date whose statute of limitations has not
expired.

  

  

(d) No Target Company is a party to or bound by any tax indemnity agreement,
tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or any similar arrangement for
the sharing of Tax liabilities or benefits. The Company does not have any
liability for any Taxes of any Person (other than itself and its current
Subsidiaries) (i) as a transferee or successor or (ii) by Contract or
otherwise.

  

  

(e) The Target Companies have not filed any Tax Returns as part of any
consolidated, combined, affiliated, aggregate or unitary group.

required to be disclosed on its Tax Return pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b).

  

  

(h) (i) The Company has had a valid election in effect under Section 1362 of
the Code and any comparable provision of state or local Law for all taxable
years of its existence through and including the Closing Date (the "S
Election") and such S Election has never been terminated or revoked and (ii)
the Target Companies have not, in the past ten years, acquired assets from
another corporation in a transaction in which the Target Companies' tax basis
was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the tax basis of the
acquired assets in the hands of the transferor.

  

  

(i) The Company has only three Subsidiaries as follows: K. A. Steel
International Inc., KAS Muscatine LLC and HPCM LLC, each of which is wholly-
owned by the Company. K. A. Steel International Inc. has been a "domestic
international sales corporation" at all times since the date it became a
Subsidiary of the Company. Each of KAS Muscatine LLC and HPCM LLC has been a
disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes at all times since it
became a Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12

Company is currently a party) or otherwise contributed to or required to be
sponsored, maintained, entered into or otherwise contributed to by a Target
Company or with respect to which a Target Company has any liability or
obligation (whether actual or contingent) (each such plan, program, policy or
Contract, whether or not material, a "Benefit Plan"), provided, that the term
"Benefit Plan" shall not include any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code.

  

  

(b) The Company has made available to Purchaser (to the extent applicable):
(i) a true and complete copy of each written Benefit Plan as in effect on the
date hereof (and any amendments thereto) and summaries of the material terms
of each unwritten Benefit Plan; (ii) a copy of each trust agreement or other

Authority relating to a Benefit Plan in the past six (6) years.

  

  

(c) Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered, funded and
maintained, in form and operation, in all material respects in compliance with
its terms (except as otherwise required by Law) and all applicable
requirements of ERISA and the Code and applicable Law, and with respect to
each Benefit Plan, to the Company's knowledge, no Person has entered into any
nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in ERISA or the
Code) that is reasonably likely to result in material liability to the Target
Companies.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) Except as set forth on Section 3.20(d) of the Disclosure Letter (and other
than with respect to any Multiemployer Plan), none of the Target Companies nor
any entity treated as a single employer with any of the Target Companies under
Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA (each
such entity, an "ERISA Affiliate") sponsors, maintains or contributes to or
participates in or has during the past six (6) years sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or participated in (i) a "defined benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA or Section 414(j) of the Code, (ii) a plan

the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA or (v) a plan described in Section 4063

liability (whether actual or contingent) for (A) failure to meet the minimum
funding standards under Section 412 or 430 or the Tax under 4971 of the Code
with respect to a single employer plan, (B) violation of the continuation
requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or
(C) violation of the group health requirements of Section 701 et seq. of ERISA
and Section 9801 et seq. of the Code, and no circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any such liability on a
Target Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates at or after
the Closing. No Benefit Plan or other contract requires any Target Company to
provide (or is reasonably likely to require any Target Company to provide)
current or future retired or terminated employees or other service providers
with medical, life insurance or other welfare-type benefits (other than as
required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the
Code or under a similar applicable state Law).

  

  

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in
the aggregate, in material liability to the Target Companies, all
contributions, premiums or other payments that are due have been paid on a
timely basis with respect to each Benefit Plan. All unfunded liabilities with
respect to any Benefit Plan have been properly accounted for on the Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP.

  

  

(f) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of a
"qualified plan" under Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such
Benefit Plan is tax-qualified and to the Company's knowledge no events have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualified
status.

  

  

(g) Except as set forth on Section 3.20(g) of the Disclosure Letter, there
does not exist any pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
Proceeding (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits) with respect to
any Benefit Plan or the assets of any trust for any Benefit Plan.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth on Section 3.20(h) of the Disclosure Letter, neither
the execution of any Transaction Document nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), in each case, alone or in combination with any other event, will (i)
accelerate the time of the payment or vesting of, or increase the amount of,
or result in the payment, funding or forfeiture of compensation or benefits
payable to any current or former employee or other service provider of the
Target Companies, or trigger any other material obligation under any Benefit
Plan, (ii) result in any breach or violation of any Benefit Plan or (iii)
limit or restrict the right of Purchaser to merge, amend or terminate any
Benefit Plan on or after the Closing Date. No current or former employee or
other service provider of the Target Companies is entitled to any gross-up,
make-whole or other additional payment from any Target Company in respect of
any Tax (including Taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code) or interest
or penalty related thereto.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) Except as set forth on Section 3.20(i) of the Disclosure Letter or as
would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to a Target
Company, each Benefit Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) (i) was,
between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, operated and administered in
good-faith compliance with, and based on a reasonable interpretation of (A)
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and (B) applicable guidance
issued thereunder (including IRS Notice 2005-1) (clauses (A) and (B),
together, the "409A Authorities") and (ii) has been, since the later of (A)
January 1, 2009 and (B) such plan's, agreement's or arrangement's inception
date, in a written form that materially complies with, and has been
administered in material compliance with, the 409A Authorities and the final
regulations promulgated and in effect thereunder. No Target Company has any
obligation to gross-up or indemnify any individual with respect to any
additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

  

  

(j) Section 3.20(j) of the Disclosure Letter lists each "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414(f)
of the Code which is sponsored, maintained by or otherwise contributed to or
required to be sponsored, maintained or otherwise contributed to by a Target
Company or any ERISA Affiliate or with respect to which a Target Company or
any ERISA Affiliate has any liability or obligation (whether actual or
contingent) (each such multiemployer plan, a "Multiemployer Plan"). No Target
Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has withdrawn from a Multiemployer
Plan and none of the Target Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate is liable to any
Multiemployer Plan for any currently due and payable withdrawal liability
imposed by Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA. To the Company's knowledge, as of
the date hereof, (i) the Company has provided to Purchaser the most recent
estimate of Withdrawal Liability received by the Company from any
Multiemployer Plan and (ii) no events have occurred and no circumstances exist
(in each case, that specifically relate to (x) the Target Companies'
participation in the applicable Multiemployer Plan or (y) the other
participants in such Multiemployer Plan) that would reasonably be expected to
increase the amount of such Withdrawal Liability. With respect to each
Multiemployer Plan, none of the Target Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate has
received written notice of, and the Company has no knowledge of: (A) any
pending or threatened Proceeding (other than routine undisputed claims for
benefits) with respect to such plan; (B) any complete or partial termination
(whether by mass withdrawal or otherwise) of such plan; or (C) any such plan
being in reorganization or insolvent. Neither the execution of any Transaction
Document nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both), in each case, alone or in
combination with any other event, will (1) trigger any material obligation
under any Multiemployer Plan or (2) result in any breach or violation of any
Multiemployer Plan. None of the Target Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate is
delinquent in making any contributions required to be paid to any
Multiemployer Plan. The Company has the unilateral right, subject to effects
bargaining, to withdraw from the Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse
Workers Union (Independent) Pension Fund, at any time during the current term
of the collective bargaining agreement which provides for participation in
such plan.

classification of employees, immigration, visa, work status, human rights, pay
equity, the payment of social security and similar Taxes and workers'
compensation, and have not engaged in any unfair labor practices with respect
to any employees or other service providers, in each case, except where any
failures to be in compliance or any engagement in such practices, individually
or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to give rise to a
material liability or obligation of the Target Companies.

  

  

(c) No Target Company has in the past three (3) years or is reasonably likely
to incur any material liability or obligation, including under or on account
of a Benefit Plan, arising out of the misclassification of individuals hired
to provide services to the Target Companies and treating such individuals as
(i) consultants or independent contractors and not as employees or (ii) exempt
employees and not as non-exempt employees.

programs. All Insurance Policies are in full force and effect and all premiums
with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the Closing Date
have been paid or will be paid prior to the Closing substantially in
accordance with the payment terms of each such Insurance Policy. No Target
Company has received written notice under any Insurance Policy denying or
disputing any claim (or coverage with respect thereto) made by any Target
Company or regarding the termination, cancellation or material amendment of,
or material premium increase with respect to, any Insurance Policy, in each
case, at any time during the three (3) year period prior to the date hereof.

Insurance Policy and there are no material pending claims under any Insurance

No Target Company or any Related Party thereof has an interest, directly or
indirectly, in any business, corporate or otherwise, that is in competition
with the Target Companies.

Transaction Documents (a "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect").

authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and all the other
Transaction Documents to be executed or delivered by Purchaser in connection

parties thereto (as applicable), will be duly executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of Purchaser and will constitute valid and binding

authorization, Order or approval of, or filing or registration with, any
Governmental Authority is required for or in connection with the consummation

not obtained would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.

delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents by Purchaser,
nor the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,

other organizational document, as applicable), or of any statute or
administrative regulation, or of any Order of any court or Governmental
Authority or of any arbitration award.

unexpired, undischarged or unsatisfied Contract under the terms of which
performance by Purchaser according to the terms of this Agreement will be a
default or an event of acceleration, or grounds for termination, modification
or cancellation, in each case, which would reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

which shall be paid by Purchaser), neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
has dealt with any Person who is entitled to a broker's commission, finder's

securities Laws. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"). Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities Laws and are being
transferred to Purchaser, in part, in reliance on the foregoing
representation.

other party all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to promptly obtain any clearance
required under the HSR Act and any other antitrust or foreign competition Laws
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall provide prompt notice of any communications (whether oral or written)
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any
Governmental Authority, and each party shall have the right to participate in
any meeting between Purchaser, a Seller, a Target Company or the Seller
Representative, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other
hand, concerning such filings or the subject matter thereof, in each case to
the extent legally permissible; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no party or any of its Affiliates shall be
required to bring any Proceeding against any Person or accept, as a condition
to obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of any
Governmental Authority, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust
(or the imposition of any other material condition or restriction with respect
to) any of their (and their Affiliates') respective businesses or assets.

things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable. Between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, none of the parties hereto shall intentionally perform
any act that, if performed, or intentionally omit to perform any act that, if
omitted to be performed, would prevent or excuse the performance of this

warranty herein contained of such party being untrue in any material respect
as if originally made on and as of the Closing Date.

of the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties agree to, and agree to cause

Purchaser relating to the conduct of the Target Companies' business prior to
Closing so long as such information remains Confidential Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).

SECTION 11.2 Sellers' Indemnification Obligations.

  

  

(a) Sellers' Several Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the provisions of
this Article XI, from and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall indemnify,
defend, protect and hold harmless (on a pro rata basis in accordance with
their respective Percentage Ownership and not on a joint and several basis)
Purchaser and the Target Companies (as owned by Purchaser on and after the
Closing Date) and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees
and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") for, from and against
any and all Damages sustained or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee to the
extent caused by, resulting from or attributable to:

  

  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty made by the
Company or the Seller Representative to Purchaser herein or in any closing
document (including any certificates and Transaction Documents) delivered to
Purchaser in connection herewith; provided, that all such representations and
warranties that are qualified as to materiality or by reference to a Material
Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not so qualified; or

  

  

(ii) any breach by the Company, the Seller Representative, or any Seller of,
or any failure of the Company, the Seller Representative or any Seller to
comply with, any of the covenants or obligations under this Agreement or in
any Transaction Document to be performed or complied with by the Company, the
Seller Representative or any Seller (including obligations under this Article
XI).

  

  

(b) Sellers' Individual Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the provisions
of this Article XI, from and after the Closing Date, each Seller shall
indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless (individually and not on a joint
and several basis) the Purchaser Indemnitees for, from and against any and all
Damages sustained or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee to the extent caused
by, resulting from or attributable to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation and warranty made by such Seller to Purchaser herein or in any
closing document (including any certificates and Transaction Documents)
delivered to Purchaser in connection herewith; provided, that all such
representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or by
reference to a Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not so qualified.

  

  

SECTION 11.3 Limitation on Sellers' Indemnification Obligations. Sellers'
obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.2 are subject to the
following limitations:

  

  

(a) Except with respect to the breach or inaccuracy of any of the Special
Representations or Damages attributable to fraud, the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b) on any
individual claim unless the Damages associated with such claim exceed $50,000.

  

  

(b) Except with respect to the breach or inaccuracy of any of the Special
Representations or Damages attributable to fraud, the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b) until
the total amount of Damages that Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under
Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b), but for this Section 11.3(b), exceeds 1% of
the Purchase Price (the "Basket"). Once the total amount of Damages that the
Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(b), but
for this Section 11.3(b), exceeds the Basket, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall
be entitled to recover only the amount of such Damages in excess of the
Basket.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Except with respect to the breach or inaccuracy of any of the Special
Representations or the Special Covenants and Damages attributable to fraud,
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under Section 11.2
for the amount of Damages in excess of the Escrow Amount, as it may be reduced
from time to time pursuant to this Agreement (the "Indemnification Cap").
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, instructing the Escrow Agent to release that portion of the Escrow
Amount equal to the amount of Damages to which Purchaser is entitled to
recover hereunder. In no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to
recover for any Damages which are, individually or in the aggregate, in excess
of the Indemnification Cap, provided, that, in the event any Damages with
respect to (i) the breach or inaccuracy of any of the Special Representations
or the Special Covenants or (ii) fraud, exceed the then current balance of the
Escrow Account, Purchaser shall be reimbursed directly by Sellers on a several
basis (in accordance with their Percentage Ownership) for the portion of the
Damages in excess of the then current balance of the Escrow Account; provided,
further, that the individual liability of any Seller for such Damages will not
exceed the cash proceeds actually received by such Seller pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) The amount of any recovery by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 11.2 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually
paid to the Purchaser Indemnitees under any applicable insurance policy (net
of (i) reasonable costs and expenses incurred in recovering such amounts and
(ii) any deductibles and premium increases relating to such proceeds) and the
amount of indemnification and other payments actually paid to the Purchaser
Indemnitees under any applicable indemnification agreements or similar rights
as a result of the facts that entitled the Purchaser Indemnitees to recover
from Sellers pursuant to Section 11.2. Each Purchaser Indemnitee agrees to
make all claims under applicable insurance policies (other than self-insurance
policies), indemnification agreements and similar rights and to seek recovery
under all applicable insurance policies, indemnification agreements and
similar rights for all Damages to the extent such Damages are covered by any
insurance policy, indemnification agreement or similar right of such Purchaser
Indemnitee.

  

  

(e) No Seller shall be liable for Damages with respect to the representations
and warranties contained in Article IV to the extent that such representations
and warranties relate to another Seller, nor shall any Seller have any
liability for the failure of another Seller to perform any of the obligations,
covenants or agreements to be performed or complied with by such other Seller
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, it being agreed and
understood that all of such representations, warranties, obligations,
covenants and agreements are being made severally by each Seller, and not on a
joint and several basis.

  

  

(f) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE PURCHASER INDEMNITEES
SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER UNDER SECTION 11.2 WITH RESPECT TO
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (REGARDLESS OF THE CHARACTERIZATION
THEREOF), DAMAGES CONSISTING OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, DAMAGES
COMPUTED ON A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS, BOOK VALUE, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW OR ANY
SIMILAR BASIS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN ARRIVING AT THE AGGREGATE
CONSIDERATION OR THAT MAY BE REFLECTIVE OF THE EQUITY VALUE OF THE COMPANY,
AND INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, UNLESS (I) SUCH
PURCHASER INDEMNITEE IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM THAT IS OTHERWISE INDEMNIFIABLE HEREUNDER
OR (II) SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM OR ARISE OUT OF OR BY VIRTUE OF FRAUD.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover under Section 11.2, with respect to the
failure to obtain any consent, or to satisfy any conditions imposed incident
to the giving of any consent, required in connection with, or as a consequence
of, the transfer of the Shares to Purchaser (but shall not relieve any
liability for failure to list a consent required to be listed on the relevant
section of the Disclosure Letter).

  

  

(h) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Damages
relating to any matter arising under a provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Purchaser Indemnitees have already recovered Damages with
respect to such matter pursuant to another provision of this Agreement.

  

  

(i) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in respect
of a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty shall terminate when
the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 11.1;
provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which the party to be indemnified
shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period,
previously made a claim pursuant to Section 11.5.

  

  

SECTION 11.4 Purchaser's Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the
provisions of this Article XI, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Sellers and their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") for, from and against any and all
Damages sustained or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee to the extent caused
by, resulting from or attributable to:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty made by
Purchaser to Sellers herein or in any closing document (including certificates
and Transaction Documents) delivered to Sellers in connection herewith;
provided, that all such representations and warranties that are qualified as
to materiality or by reference to a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect shall be
deemed to be not so qualified; or

  

  

(b) any breach by Purchaser of, or any failure by Purchaser to comply with,
any of the covenants or obligations under this Agreement to be performed by
Purchaser (including its obligations under this Article XI).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 11.5 Notice and Determination of Claims. If any Indemnified Party
believes that it has sustained or incurred any Damages for which it may be
entitled to indemnification, whether or not the applicable dollar limitation
specified by Article XI has been exceeded, such Indemnified Party shall so
notify the Indemnifying Party promptly in writing (the "Claim Notice")
specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnification is asserted and describing such Damages, the amount thereof,
if known, or a good faith estimate (to the extent practicable) of the amount,
and the method of computation of such Damages, all with reasonable
particularity. After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the
amount of indemnification to which a person shall be entitled under this
Article XI shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in
this Section 11.5 and Section 11.6 or: (a) by the written agreement between
the parties; (b) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction; or (c) by any other means to which the parties shall agree. For
purposes of this Article XI, the judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed
final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall
have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.
A failure by an Indemnified Party to give timely, complete or accurate notice
as provided in this Article XI will not affect the rights or obligations of
any party hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a result of such
failure, any party entitled to receive such notice was materially damaged as a
result of such failure to give timely notice vis-a-vis its rights and
obligations hereunder or otherwise.

  

  

SECTION 11.6 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Promptly following the receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim, the party
receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall notify the other party of
its existence setting forth with reasonable specificity the facts and
circumstances of which such party has received notice and, if the party giving
such notice is an Indemnified Party, specifying the basis hereunder upon which
the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification is asserted and describing
such Damages, the amount thereof, if known, or a good faith estimate (to the
extent practicable) of the amount, and the method of computation of such
Damages, all with reasonable particularity.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 11.6(d), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, the defense, compromise and settlement of
any Third Party Claim as to which indemnification is sought by any Indemnified
Party from any Indemnifying Party hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly as possible (but in any
event within ten (10) days) after receipt of the notice of Third Party Claim
given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under Section 11.6(a)
of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the reasonable legal fees and expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to offset any recovery actually received
from a third party by the Indemnified Party of its legal fees and expenses in
connection with such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party may participate,
through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any
such Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has so elected to
conduct and control the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in connection with the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party
Claim pursuant to this Section 11.6 and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery, hearings,
trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party written notice of
the Indemnifying Party's intention to settle any Third Party Claim at least
ten (10) days prior to the settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Whether
or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise such claim or demand without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, unless the Indemnified Party is given a full and
complete release of any and all liability by all relevant parties to such
claim or demand and the damages payable under the settlement are limited to
monetary payments to be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay,
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim then being defended by the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that in such event the Indemnified Party shall
waive any right to indemnity therefor hereunder.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 11.6(b) to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control, through counsel
of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third Party
Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party which the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its legal counsel, cannot be separated from
any related claim for monetary damages, (ii) the Indemnified Party is a
Purchaser Indemnitee and it determines in good faith that the Damages that may
be incurred as a result of such Third Party Claim exceed, individually or when
aggregated with all other outstanding claims, the then current balance of the
Escrow Account, (iii) the settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect
to, such Third Party Claim is reasonably likely to, in the good faith judgment
of the Indemnified Party, establish a precedential custom or practice adverse
in any material respect to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Party or (iv) the Indemnifying Party is also a party and joint
representation would be inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available
to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnified Party. Additionally, the Indemnifying Party shall
lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle the Third Party Claim
if it shall fail to accept a tender of the defense of the Third Party Claim or
if it shall fail to diligently contest the Third Party Claim. In such event,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that at least ten (10) days prior to any
such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle is given to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may participate, through counsel
chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third Party
Claim as to which the Indemnified Party retains, pursuant to this Section
11.6(d), the right to conduct and control the defense thereof. For each such
Third Party Claim that the Indemnified Party conducts and controls pursuant to
Section 11.6(d)(ii), the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise such
claim or demand without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

SECTION 11.7 Indemnification Exclusive Remedy. Except for remedies that cannot
be waived as a matter of Law and injunctive and provisional relief (including
specific performance), if the Closing occurs, indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this Article XI shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties with respect to any matters arising under or relating to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Employment Agreements), including any
closing document executed and delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the only legal action
that may be asserted by any party with respect to any such breach, inaccuracy
or failure that is the subject of this Article XI shall be an action to
enforce, or to recover damages for the breach of, this Article XI.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section 11.7
shall not apply to any claim for Damages as a result of or arising out of or
by virtue of fraud of any party hereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 11.8 Obligations to Mitigate Damages. Each Indemnified Party shall
take, and shall cause all other Indemnified Parties to take, commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all Damages upon and after becoming aware of
any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party
with respect to any Damages for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of
(i) reasonable costs and expenses incurred in recovering such amounts and (ii)
any deductibles and premium increases relating to such recovery) shall be made
promptly to the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

SECTION 11.9 Indemnification as to Tax Matters. Section 11.2 through Section
11.7 shall not apply to indemnification with respect to Taxes, which shall be
governed solely by Sections 11.8 and 12.8.

  

  

ARTICLE XII

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

SECTION 12.1 Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns. The
Seller Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns
for each Target Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
which are filed after the Closing Date and all such Tax Returns shall be
correct and complete and shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past
practice of the Company. The Seller Representative shall permit Purchaser to
review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence
prior to filing and shall make such changes as are reasonably requested by
Purchaser. After such review, the Seller Representative shall submit such Tax
Returns to the Company for filing along with the excess, if any, of the amount
of Taxes shown as due and owing on such Tax Returns less any accrual for Taxes
contained on the Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in the
calculation of the Aggregate Consideration. Sellers shall be entitled to any
Tax refunds or credits that are received by Purchaser or any of the Target
Companies that arise in Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause the Company to make all filings and
take all actions necessary to secure such refunds as promptly as possible and
to pay to Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
fifteen (15) days after the actual receipt of such refund or credit against
Taxes.

  

  

SECTION 12.2 Preparation and Filing of Post-Closing Period Tax Returns.
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for each
Target Company for all other Tax periods which are filed after the Closing
Date. In the case of any Straddle Period, Purchaser shall permit the Seller
Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such changes as are
reasonably requested by the Seller Representative. Sellers shall be
responsible for their pro-rata shares of Taxes shown as due and owing on any
Tax Return for a Straddle Period, less any accrual for Taxes contained on the
Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in the calculation of the
Aggregate Consideration. Sellers shall make any required payment on or before
the date of filing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 12.3 Apportionment of Straddle Period Income Taxes. For all purposes
of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, (i) real, personal and
intangible property Taxes and similar Taxes ("Property Taxes") shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
on a daily pro-rata basis and (ii) all Taxes other than Property Taxes shall
be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period on a closing of the books basis.

  

  

SECTION 12.4 Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, real property transfer,
documentary, recording, gains, stock transfer and similar Taxes and fees, and
any deficiency, interest or penalty asserted with respect thereto
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), arising out of or in connection with the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne equally by
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand.

  

  

SECTION 12.5 Cooperation. After the Closing, Purchaser and the Target
Companies, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall cooperate,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
contractors, consultants, agents, auditors and representatives to reasonably
cooperate with each other in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, resolving
disputes and in all other matters relating to Taxes, including by maintaining
and making available all books and records relating to Taxes.

  

  

SECTION 12.6 Section 338(h)(10) Election.

Election with respect to the Company.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and file all Section 338 Forms in accordance with
applicable Tax Laws and the Allocation (defined below) and shall deliver a
draft of such Section 338 Forms to Sellers at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the date such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. Purchaser shall
consider in good faith any changes to such forms reasonably requested by
Sellers. Sellers shall execute and deliver to Purchaser such Section 338 Forms
(as amended) at least five (5) days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms
are required to be filed.

  

  

(c) Purchaser and Sellers agree to allocate the Aggregate Closing
Consideration (taking into account any adjustments under Article XI), the
liabilities of the Company and other relevant items among the assets of the
Company for all Tax purposes in accordance with Section 338(b)(5) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Allocation").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) Purchaser will present a draft of the Allocation (the "Proposed
Allocation") to Sellers for review as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date (and in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date).
Except as provided in subparagraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 12.6, at the
close of business on the 30th day after delivery of the Proposed Allocation,
the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon Purchaser and Sellers and
shall be the Allocation.

  

  

(e) Sellers shall raise any objection to the Proposed Allocation in writing
within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the Proposed Allocation. Purchaser
and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences for
thirty (30) days after delivery of any objection by Sellers. If Purchaser and
Sellers reach written agreement amending the Proposed Allocation, the Proposed
Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon Purchaser and Sellers and
shall be the Allocation.

  

  

(f) If Purchaser and Sellers cannot agree on the Allocation within the 30-day
period set forth in subparagraph (e) of this Section 12.6, then all remaining
disputed items shall be submitted for resolution by a nationally recognized,
independent accounting firm mutually selected by Sellers and Purchaser (the
"Allocation Accounting Firm"). The Allocation Accounting Firm shall make a
final determination as to the disputed items within thirty (30) days after
such submission. Such determination shall be limited to determining the
Allocation and shall be final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and
Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Allocation Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by Purchaser and Sellers.

  

  

SECTION 12.7 Tax Reporting. Sellers and Purchaser shall file all Tax Returns,
and take all positions with a Governmental Authority, that (i) are consistent
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Allocation and (ii) treat the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 12.8 Tax Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Following the Closing, Sellers shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees
and hold them harmless from (i) all Taxes of the Target Companies for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including Taxes arising from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, (ii) all Taxes of any Person other than the Target Companies for
which the Target Companies are liable under a Contract entered into in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or by operation of Law as a result of circumstances
existing in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) all Damages resulting from any
breach by Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than, after the Closing,
the Target Companies) or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty under
Section 3.11 (without regard to materiality qualifiers) or any covenant under
Article XII and (iv) 50% of the Taxes described in Section 12.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not have any indemnification
obligation for (A) any Taxes attributable to any transaction occurring after
the Closing on the Closing Date that is not in the ordinary course of
business, and (B) all Taxes imposed on any Target Company as a result of any
action taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing that is
not in the ordinary course of business other than the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not have any
indemnification obligation for any Taxes (1) that are attributable to a period
(or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (unless attributable to
the Section 338(h)(10) Election, interest or penalties on a Tax that arose in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Tax arising under Section 12.8(a)(ii)), or (2)
are due to the unavailability in any tax period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other tax
attributes from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to,
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees and hold them harmless from (i) Taxes of the
Target Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any breach by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates of any covenant contained in this Article XII and
(iii) 50% of the Taxes described in Section 12.4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not have any indemnification obligation for any
Taxes indemnified by Sellers under Section 12.8(a)(iii).

  

  

(c) Promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the existence of a
Tax issue that may give rise to an indemnification claim under this Section
12.8 (a "Tax Controversy"), by it against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the Tax Controversy,
and thereafter shall promptly forward to the Indemnifying Party copies of
notices and communications with a Governmental Authority relating to such Tax
Controversy. Failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice to the
Indemnifying Party on a timely basis shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under this Section 12.8 only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially adversely affected by a failure to receive
such notice on a timely basis. Except as provided in this Section 12.8(c), the
Indemnifying Party may elect to control, and may elect to have sole discretion
in handling, settling or contesting any audit inquiry, information request,
audit proceeding or any other Proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy for
which it could be required to indemnify the other party if it acknowledges in
writing that it has sole liability for any Taxes that might arise in such
proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Tax proceeding with
respect to a Tax Controversy on a basis that would adversely affect the
Indemnified Party without obtaining the Indemnified Party's written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall
keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed as to the progress of any Tax
proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy and shall consider in good faith
any written comments or suggestions regarding such Tax proceeding from the
Indemnified Party. Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in handling, settling
or contesting a Tax Controversy shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.
Purchaser and Seller Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall jointly
control, and have the right to participate in all activities and strategic
decisions with respect to, any Tax Proceedings for which each party would be
required to indemnify the other party with respect to one or more Tax
Controversies.

  

  

(d) Any indemnity payment to be made hereunder shall be paid within ten (10)
days after the Indemnified Party makes written demand upon the Indemnifying
Party, but in no case earlier than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on
which the relevant Taxes (including any estimated Tax payments) are required
to be paid to the relevant Governmental Authority.

  

  

(e) The indemnification provisions in this Section 12.8 shall survive until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). If written
notice of a claim has been given in accordance with this Section 12.8 prior to
the expiration of such indemnification provisions, then such indemnification
provisions shall survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally
resolved.

Representative and Sellers to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after
receipt of notice from Purchaser requesting such breach to be cured;

  

  

(d) by the Seller Representative in the event of any breach by Purchaser of
any of Purchaser's agreements, representations or warranties contained herein,

this Agreement shall have any claim against any other party to this Agreement,
except for willful breach of a material representation, warranty or covenant
set forth in this Agreement, in which event termination of this Agreement
shall not be deemed or construed as limiting or denying any legal or equitable
right or remedy of the non-breaching parties to this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48

termination of this Agreement by either the Seller Representative or Purchaser

(b) Section 3.24, Section 5.7, Section 13.3, this Section 13.4 and Article XV
shall survive termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 15.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Letter), the Escrow Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other
instruments to be delivered by the parties pursuant to the provisions hereof
constitute the entire agreement between the parties and shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns. Each exhibit and schedule

amendments, or alternative or supplementary provisions, to this Agreement,
must be made in writing and duly executed by an authorized representative or

SECTION 15.5 Non-Waiver. The failure in any one or more instances of a party
to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement
conferred, or the waiver by such party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a

it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission to deliver a signature or
the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated
through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic transmission as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
