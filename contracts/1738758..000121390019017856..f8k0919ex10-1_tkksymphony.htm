NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

  



  

Article I _ 
 THE SHARE EXCHANGE_

  



  

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. At the Closing and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall sell, transfer,
convey, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase,
acquire and accept from the Sellers, all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the Company (collectively, the " _Purchased Shares_ "), free and clear of
all Liens (other than potential restrictions on resale under applicable
securities Laws).

  



  

1.2 _Consideration_. At the Closing, subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in full payment for the Purchased Shares, the
Purchaser shall issue and deliver to the Sellers an aggregate number of
Purchaser Ordinary Shares (the " _Exchange Shares_ ") equal to (a) Four
Hundred Twenty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$425,000,000) (the " _Company
Equity Valuation_ "), divided by (b) the Redemption Price, subject to the
withholding of the Escrow Shares deposited in the Escrow Account in
accordance with _Section 1.3_. Each Seller shall receive its pro rata share
of the Exchange Shares based on the percentage of Purchased Shares owned by
such Seller as compared to the total number of Purchased Shares owned by all
Sellers (such percentage being each such Seller's " _Pro Rata Share_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fraction of a
Purchaser Ordinary Share will be issued by the Purchaser by virtue of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Purchaser Ordinary Share (after
aggregating all fractional Purchaser Ordinary Shares that would otherwise be
received by such Person) shall instead have the number of Purchaser
Ordinary Shares issued to such Person rounded down in the aggregate to the
nearest whole Purchaser Ordinary Share. Additionally, after the Closing, the
Sellers shall have the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares from the
Purchaser subject to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.4_
hereof.

  



  

1.3 _Escrow_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser, the Purchaser Representative,
the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an Escrow
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, in form and substance consistent with
the provisions of this Agreement and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser and the Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the
Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent at the Closing five
percent (5%) of the Exchange Shares otherwise deliverable to the Sellers at
the Closing (including any equity securities paid as dividends or
distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are
exchanged or converted, the " _Escrow Shares_ "), with the Escrow
Shares, along with any dividends, distributions and other earnings thereon
and other Escrow Property, to be held by the Escrow Agent in a segregated
escrow account (" _Escrow Account_ ") and disbursed therefrom in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Shares and other Escrow Property shall serve as a source of
security for the Sellers' indemnification obligations after the Closing under
_Article VII_. The portion of the Exchange Shares that shall be withheld at
the Closing for deposit in the Escrow Account shall be allocated among the
Sellers pro rata based on each Seller's Pro Rata Share. Each Seller shall
have the right to vote its portion of such Escrow Shares (based on its
Pro Rata Share, subject to adjustment for any Escrow Shares that are
forfeited or earned in a manner other than pro rata among all Sellers based
on their Pro Rata Share, as indicated in writing by the Seller Representative
to the Purchaser, the Purchaser Representative and the Escrow Agent) during
the time held in the Escrow Account as Escrow Shares.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(b) The Escrow Property shall no longer be subject to any indemnification
claim after the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the
" _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to any
indemnification claims made in accordance with _Article VII_ hereof on or
prior to the Expiration Date (including those that are revised or adjusted in
accordance with _Article VII_ after the Expiration Date) that remain
unresolved as of the end of the Expiration Date (" _Pending Claims_ "), all
or a portion of the Escrow Property reasonably necessary to satisfy such
Pending Claims (as determined based on the amount of the indemnification
claim included in the Claim Notice provided by the Purchaser Representative
under _Article VII_ and the Purchaser Share Price as of the Expiration Date)
shall remain in the Escrow Account until such time as such Pending Claim
shall have been finally resolved pursuant to the provisions of _Article VII_.
After the Expiration Date, any Escrow Property remaining in the Escrow
Account that is not subject to Pending Claims, if any, and not subject to
resolved but unpaid claims in favor of an Indemnitee, shall be disbursed by
the Escrow Agent to the Sellers, with each Seller receiving its Pro
Rata Share (subject to adjustment for any Escrow Property that is forfeited
or earned in a manner other than pro rata among all Sellers based on their
Pro Rata Share, as indicated in writing by the Seller Representative to the
Purchaser, the Purchaser Representative and the Escrow Agent) of such Escrow
Property. Promptly after the final resolution of all Pending Claims and the
payment of all indemnification obligations in connection therewith, the
Escrow Agent shall disburse any Escrow Property remaining in the
Escrow Account to the Sellers, with each Seller receiving its Pro Rata Share
(subject to adjustment for any Escrow Property that is forfeited or earned in
a manner other than pro rata among all Sellers based on their Pro Rata Share,
as indicated in writing by the Seller Representative to the Purchaser, the
Purchaser Representative and the Escrow Agent) of such Escrow Property.

  



  

1.4 _Earnout_.

  



  

(a) After the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Sellers shall have the contingent right to receive
additional consideration from Purchaser based on the performance of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2019 (the " _2019 Earnout Year_ ") and the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2020 (the " _2020 Earnout Year_ " and each such fiscal year, an
" _Earnout Year_ " and such two-year fiscal period, the " _Earnout Period_ ")
if the requirements as set forth in this _Section 1.4_ are met. In the event
that the Purchaser Adjusted Net Income for the 2019 Earnout Year is equal to
or greater than One Hundred and Eighty Million Renminbi (RMB180,000,000) (the
" _2019 Earnout Target_ "), then, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall be entitled to receive from the Purchaser, as
additional consideration for the purchase of the Purchased Shares, an
additional Five Million (5,000,000) Purchaser Ordinary Shares (subject to
equitable adjustment for share splits, share dividends, combinations,
recapitalizations and the like after the Closing, including to account for
any equity securities into which such shares are exchanged or converted) (the
" _2019 Earnout Shares_ "). In the event that the Purchaser Adjusted Net
Income for the 2020 Earnout Year is equal to or greater than Three Hundred and
Fifteen Million Renminbi (RMB315,000,000) (the " _2020 Earnout Target_ " and
together with the 2019 Earnout Target, the " _Earnout Targets_ "), then,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be
entitled to receive from the Purchaser, as additional consideration for the
purchase of the Purchased Shares, an additional Five Million (5,000,000)
Purchaser Ordinary Shares (subject to equitable adjustment for share splits,
share dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like after the
Closing, including to account for any equity securities into which such shares
are exchanged or converted) (the " _2020 Earnout Shares_ ", and collectively
with the 2019 Earnout Shares, the " _Earnout Shares_ ")). In the event that
an Earnout Target is not met for any Earnout Year, the Sellers shall not be
entitled to receive any Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year; provided, that
in the event that the aggregate Purchaser Adjusted Net Income for both
Earnout Years combined is at least Four Hundred and Ninety Five Million
Renminbi (RMB495,000,000) (the " _Aggregate Earnout Target_ "), the Sellers
shall be entitled to receive any Earnout Shares that they otherwise did not
receive (the " _Alternative Earnout_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any
determination of the Purchaser Adjusted Net Income that is not otherwise in
Renminbi will be expressed in Renminbi by converting the applicable currency
to Renminbi using the applicable exchange rate as of the last day of the
applicable Earnout Year.

(b) As soon as practicable (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days)
after Purchaser's filing of the annual audited consolidated financial
statements for Purchaser and its Subsidiaries with the SEC on Form 20-F or
10-K (or other equivalent SEC form) for each Earnout Year, the Purchaser's
Chief Financial Officer (the " _CFO_ ") will prepare and deliver to
the Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative (each, a "
_Representative Party_ ") a written statement (each, an " _Earnout Statement_
") that sets forth the CFO's determination in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 1.4_ of (i) the Purchaser Adjusted Net Income for such Earnout
Year based on such audited financial statements, (ii) for the 2020 Earnout
Year only, the aggregate Purchaser Adjusted Net Income for both Earnout Years
combined based on such audited financial statements and the finally
determined Earnout Statement for the 2019 Earnout Year, and (iii) whether the
Sellers are entitled to receive Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year as a
result of achieving the applicable Earnout Target or, with respect to the
2020 Earnout Year only, the Aggregate Earnout Target. Each Representative
Party will have thirty (30) days after its receipt of an Earnout Statement to
review it. The Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative, and
their respective Representatives on their behalves, may make inquiries of the
CFO and related Purchaser and Company personnel and advisors regarding
questions concerning or disagreements with the Earnout Statement arising in
the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser and the Company
shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection therewith. If either
Representative Party has any objections to the Earnout Statement, such
Representative Party shall deliver to the Company (to the attention of the
CFO) and the other Representative Party a statement setting forth its
objections thereto (in reasonable detail) (an " _Objection Statement_ "). If
an Objection Statement is not delivered by a Representative Party within
thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Earnout
Statement, then such Representative Party will have waived its right to
contest the Earnout Statement, and all determinations and calculations set
forth therein, and whether the Sellers have earned the Earnout Shares for such
Earnout Year (or have otherwise achieved the Alternative Earnout). If an
Objection Statement is delivered within such thirty (30) day period, then the
Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such objections for a period of twenty (20)
days thereafter. If the Seller Representative and the Purchaser
Representative do not reach a final resolution within such twenty (20) day
period, then upon the written request of either Representative Party (the date
of receipt of such notice by the other Representative Party, the "
_Independent Expert Notice Date_ "), the Representative Parties will refer the
dispute to the Independent Expert for final resolution of the dispute in
accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_. The Parties acknowledge that
any information provided pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ will be subject to
the confidentiality obligations of _Section 6.13_.

(c) If a dispute with respect to an Earnout Statement is submitted in
accordance with this _Section 1.4_ to the Independent Expert for final
resolution, the Parties will follow the procedures set forth in this _Section
1.4(c)_. Each of the Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by the
Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will be
borne by the Purchaser. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Independent Expert will be
borne by the Sellers, and all other costs and expenses incurred by the
Purchaser Representative in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder
before the Independent Expert will be borne by the Purchaser. The Independent
Expert will determine only those issues still in dispute as of the
Independent Expert Notice Date and the Independent Expert's determination
will be based solely upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The determination by the Independent Expert will be based
solely on presentations with respect to such disputed items by the Purchaser
Representative and the Seller Representative to the Independent Expert and not
on the Independent Expert's independent review; _provided_ , that such
presentations will be deemed to include any work papers, records, accounts or
similar materials delivered to the Independent Expert by a Representative
Party in connection with such presentations and any materials delivered to
the Independent Expert in response to requests by the Independent Expert. Each
of the Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative will use their
reasonable efforts to make their respective presentations as promptly as
practicable following submission to the Independent Expert of the disputed
items, and each such Representative Party will be entitled, as part of its
presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other Representative Party
and any questions and requests of the Independent Expert. In deciding any
matter, the Independent Expert will be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement, including this _Section 1.4_. It is the intent of the parties
hereto that the Independent Expert Procedure and the activities of the
Independent Expert in connection herewith are not (and should not be
considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding or similar
arbitral process and that no formal arbitration rules should be followed
(including rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The Seller
Representative and the Purchaser Representative will request that the
Independent Expert's determination be made within forty-five (45) days after
its engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, will be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Purchaser Representative and the Seller
Representative and will be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for
all purposes hereunder (other than for fraud or manifest error).

  



  

(d) If for any Earnout Year there is a final determination in accordance with
_Section 1.4(b)_ that the Sellers are entitled to receive Earnout Shares for
such Earnout Year (or have otherwise achieved the Alternative Earnout), then
such Earnout Shares will be due upon such final determination and Purchaser
will deliver such shares within ten (10) Business Days thereafter (subject to
this  _Section 1.4(e)_ )). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any obligation of the Purchaser to issue Earnout Shares under this
_Section 1.4_ will be subject to offset against the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnitors under  _Article VII_ , and the number of
Earnout Shares to be issued will be reduced by (up to a maximum equal to the
total maximum number of Earnout Shares) (i) the number of Earnout Shares used
to satisfy indemnification claims that have been made and resolved in
accordance with _Article VII_ hereof on or prior to the issuance date of such
Earnout Shares that have not been satisfied or sufficiently reserved using
the Escrow Property in accordance with _Section 1.3_ and _Article VII_ and
(ii) a number of Earnout Shares necessary to satisfy indemnification claims
that have been made in accordance with _Article VII_ hereof and that remain
unresolved on or prior to the issuance date of such Earnout Shares that have
not been sufficiently reserved using the Escrow Property in accordance with
_Section 1.3_ and _Article VII_ (with such Earnout Shares under this clause
(ii) determined based on the amount of the indemnification claim included in
the Claim Notice provided by the Purchaser Representative under _Article VII_
and the Purchaser Share Price as of the date of issuance of the Earnout
Shares). Promptly after the final resolution of all such pending
indemnification claims, the remaining Earnout Shares that have been reserved
for pending indemnification claims, if any, after using the Earnout Shares to
satisfy the indemnification obligations for the pending indemnification
claims that have been resolved, shall be issued by Purchaser to the Sellers,
with each such Seller receiving its Pro Rata Share of such Earnout Shares.

  



  

(e) Following the Closing (including during the Earnout Period), Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies, will be entitled to
operate their respective businesses based upon the business requirements of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries. Each of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
including the Target Companies will be permitted, following the Closing
(including during the Earnout Period), to make changes at its sole discretion
to its operations, organization, personnel, accounting practices and other
aspects of its business, including actions that may have an impact on the
Purchaser Adjusted Net Income and the ability of the Sellers to earn the
Earnout Shares, and the Sellers will not have any right to claim the loss of
all or any portion of any Earnout Shares or other damages as a result of such
decisions.

currently being used is not restricted by any applicable license of any Target
Company. All registrations for Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks and Internet
Assets that are owned by or exclusively licensed to any Target Company are
valid and in force, and all applications to register any Copyrights, Patents
and Trademarks are pending and in good standing, all without challenge of any
kind. No Target Company is party to any Contract that requires a Target
Company to assign to any Person all of its rights in any Intellectual
Property developed by a Target Company under such Contract.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(c) _Schedule 4.13(c)_ sets forth all licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements or permissions under which a Target Company is the licensor (each,
an " _Outbound IP License_ "), and for each such Outbound IP License,
describes (i) the applicable Intellectual Property licensed, (ii) the
licensee under such Outbound IP License, and (iii) any royalties, license fees
or other compensation due to a Target Company, if any. Each Target Company
has performed all obligations imposed on it in the Outbound IP Licenses, and
such Target Company is not, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any other
party thereto, in breach or default thereunder, nor has any event occurred
that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default
thereunder.

  



  

(d) No Action is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened against a
Target Company that challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or
right to use, sell, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property currently
owned, licensed, used or held for use by the Target Companies in any material
respect. No Target Company has received any written or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, oral notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any
infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use
of the Intellectual Property of any other Person is or may be occurring or
has or may have occurred, as a consequence of the business activities of any
Target Company. There are no Orders to which any Target Company is a party or
its otherwise bound that (i) restrict the rights of a Target Company to use,
transfer, license or enforce any Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of a Target Company in
order to accommodate a third Person's Intellectual Property, or (iii) other
than the Outbound IP Licenses, grant any third Person any right with respect
to any Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company. No Target Company is
currently infringing, or has, in the past, infringed, misappropriated or
violated any Intellectual Property of any other Person in any material
respect in connection with the ownership, use or license of any Intellectual
Property owned or purported to be owned by a Target Company or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, otherwise in connection with the conduct of the
respective businesses of the Target Companies. To the Company's Knowledge, no
third party is infringing upon, has misappropriated or is otherwise violating
any Intellectual Property owned, licensed by, licensed to, or otherwise used
or held for use by any Target Company (" _Company IP_ ") in any material
respect.

  



  

(e) All employees and independent contractors of a Target Company have
assigned to the Target Companies all Intellectual Property arising from the
services performed for a Target Company by such Persons. No current or former
officers, employees or independent contractors of a Target Company have
claimed any ownership interest in any Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no violation of a
Target Company's policies or practices related to protection of Company IP or
any confidentiality or nondisclosure Contract relating to the Intellectual
Property owned by a Target Company. The Company has made available to the
Purchaser true and complete copies of all written Contracts referenced in
subsections under which employees and independent contractors assigned their
Intellectual Property to a Target Company. To the Company's Knowledge, none
of the employees of any Target Company is obligated under any Contract, or
subject to any Order, that would materially interfere with the use of such
employee's best efforts to promote the interests of the Target Companies, or
that would materially conflict with the business of any Target Company as
presently conducted or contemplated to be conducted. Each Target Company has
taken reasonable security measures in order to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of the material Company IP.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has obtained unauthorized
access to third party information and data in the possession of a Target
Company, nor has there been any other material compromise of the security,
confidentiality or integrity of such information or data. Each Target Company
has complied with all applicable Laws relating to privacy, data protection and
security, and the collection, processing and use of personal information
(collectively, " _Data Protection Laws_ "). Each of the Target Companies has
in place and regularly monitors and fully enforces privacy policies and
guidelines compliant with all applicable Data Protection Laws. The operation
of the business of the Target Companies has not and does not violate any right
to privacy or publicity of any third person, or constitute unfair competition
or trade practices under applicable Law.

  



  

(g) The consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the material breach, material
modification, cancellation, termination, suspension of, or acceleration of
any payments with respect to, or release of source code because of (i) any
Contract providing for the license or other use of Intellectual Property owned
by a Target Company, or (ii) any Company IP License. Following the Closing,
the Company shall be permitted to exercise, directly or indirectly through its
Subsidiaries, all of the Target Companies' rights under such Contracts or
Company IP Licenses to the same extent that the Target Companies would have
been able to exercise had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
occurred, without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration
other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which the Target Companies
would otherwise be required to pay in the absence of such transactions.

  



  

4.14 _Taxes and Returns_.

  



  

(a) Each Target Company has or will have timely filed, or caused to be timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account all
available extensions), which Tax Returns are true, accurate, correct and
complete in all material respects, and has paid, collected or withheld, or
caused to be paid, collected or withheld, all Taxes required to be paid,
collected or withheld, other than such Taxes for which adequate reserves in
the Company Financials have been established. Each Target Company has
complied with all applicable Laws relating to Tax.

  



  

(b) There is no current pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened Action against a Target Company by a Governmental Authority in a

(c) No Target Company is being audited by any Tax authority or has been
notified in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, orally by any Tax
authority that any such audit is contemplated or pending. There are no claims,
assessments, audits, examinations, investigations or other Actions pending
against a Target Company in respect of any Tax, and no Target Company has been
notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or assessments against it
(other than, in each case, claims or assessments for which adequate
reserves in the Company Financials have been established).

  



  

(d) There are no Liens with respect to any Taxes upon any Target Company's
assets, other than Permitted Liens.

to the appropriate Governmental Authorities or set aside in appropriate
accounts for future payment when due.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(f) No Target Company has any outstanding waivers or extensions of any
applicable statute of limitations to assess any amount of Taxes. There are no
outstanding requests by a Target Company for any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return or within which to pay any Taxes shown to be due
on any Tax Return.

  



  

(g) No Target Company has made any change in accounting method (except as

agreement with, any taxing authority that would reasonably be expected to have
a material impact on its Taxes following the Closing.

(other than another Target Company) (i) under any applicable Tax Law, (ii) as
a transferee or successor, or (iii) by contract, indemnity or otherwise
(excluding commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course of
business, the primary purpose of which is not the sharing of Taxes). No Target
Company is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement, Tax sharing
agreement or Tax allocation agreement or similar agreement, arrangement
or practice (excluding commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business, the primary purpose of which is not the sharing of Taxes)
with respect to Taxes (including advance pricing agreement, closing agreement
or other agreement relating to Taxes with any Governmental Authority) that
will be binding on any Target Company with respect to any period following the
Closing Date.

  



  

(j) No Target Company has requested, or is it the subject of or bound by any
private letter ruling, technical advice memorandum, closing agreement or
similar ruling, memorandum or agreement with any Governmental Authority with
respect to any Taxes, nor is any such request outstanding.

  



  

(k) No Target Company: (i) has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of securities (to any Person or

the common parent corporation) qualifying for, or intended to qualify for,
Tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) within the two-year

7874(b) of the Code.

  



  

4.15 _Real Property_. _Schedule 4.15_ contains a complete and accurate list
of all premises leased or subleased or otherwise used or occupied by a Target
Company for the operation of the business of a Target Company, and of all
leases, lease guarantees, agreements and documents related thereto, including
all amendments, terminations and modifications thereof or waivers thereto
(collectively, the " _Company Real Property Leases_ "), as well as the

To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which (whether with or
without notice, lapse of time or both or the happening or occurrence of any
other event) would constitute a default on the part of a Target Company or any
other party under any of the Company Real Property Leases, and no Target

in _Schedule 4.16_ , all such items of Personal Property are in good operating
condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted consistent with the age
of such items), and are suitable for their intended use in the business of the
Target Companies. The operation of each Target Company's business as it is

otherwise contracted to, a Target Company. The Company has provided to the
Purchaser a true and complete copy of each of the Company Personal Property

to report such a claim would not be reasonably likely to be material to the
Target Companies. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and
no condition or circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to

(b) Except with respect to the information provided by or on behalf of the
Target Companies or the Sellers for inclusion in the Solicitation Documents,
the Purchaser shall ensure that, when filed, the Solicitation Documents will
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. The Purchaser shall cause the
Solicitation Documents to be disseminated as promptly as practicable after
receiving clearance from the SEC to the Purchaser's equity holders as and to
the extent such dissemination is required by U.S. federal securities laws and
the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq promulgated thereunder or
otherwise (the " _Federal Securities Laws_ "). The Company Parties and the
Sellers shall promptly provide to the Purchaser such information concerning
the Sellers, the Target Companies and their respective
businesses, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets,
Liabilities, properties, equity holders officers, directors and employees as
is either required by Federal Securities Laws or reasonably requested by the
Purchaser for inclusion in the Solicitation Documents, which information
provided by the Company Parties and the Sellers shall be true and correct and
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading. Subject
to compliance by the Company Parties and the Sellers with the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to the information provided or to
be provided by or on behalf of them for inclusion in the
Solicitation Documents, the Purchaser shall cause the Solicitation Documents
to comply in all material respects with the Federal Securities Laws. The
Purchaser shall provide copies of the proposed forms of the Solicitation
Documents (including, in each case, any amendments or supplements thereto) to
the Company such that the Company and its Representatives are afforded a
reasonable amount of time prior to the dissemination or filing thereof to
review such material and comment thereon prior to such dissemination or
filing, and the Purchaser shall reasonably consider in good faith any
comments of the Company and its Representatives. The Purchaser, the
Company Parties, the Sellers and their respective Representatives shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Closing Redemption or the Solicitation Documents and promptly correct any
information provided by such Party for use in the Solicitation Documents if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by the Federal Securities
Laws. The Purchaser shall amend or supplement the Solicitation Documents
and cause the Solicitation Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Purchaser
Ordinary Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Federal
Securities Laws and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Purchaser Organizational Documents. The Purchaser shall provide the
Company and its Representatives with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform them of any material oral comments, that the Purchaser or any of
its Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Closing Redemption or the Solicitation Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity
under the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or
material oral responses to such comments. The Company Parties and the Sellers
shall, and shall cause each of the Target Companies to, make their respective
directors, officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice, available
to the Purchaser and its Representatives in connection with the drafting of
the public filings with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Solicitation Documents, and responding in a timely
manner to comments from the SEC. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Solicitation Documents have "cleared" comments from the SEC, the Purchaser
shall cause the definitive Solicitation Documents to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the holders of Purchaser Ordinary Shares.

  



  

(c) If at any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or any of the Target Companies or Sellers, on the
other hand, or any of their respective Affiliates, businesses, operations,
condition (financial or otherwise), assets, Liabilities, properties,
officers, directors or employees, should be discovered by the Purchaser, on
the one hand, or any of the Target Companies or Sellers, on the other hand,
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Solicitation Documents, so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify each other Party and shall cooperate with
the other Parties to ensure that an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the Purchaser's shareholders.

that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ , for a
period of two (2) years after such termination, becomes legally compelled to
disclose any Purchaser Confidential Information, (A) provide the Purchaser to
the extent legally permitted with prompt written notice of such requirement so
that the Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof may seek, at the Purchaser's cost,

6.13(a)_ , and (B) in the event that such protective Order or other remedy is
not obtained, or the Purchaser waives compliance with this _Section 6.13(a)_
, furnish only that portion of such Purchaser Confidential Information which
is legally required to be provided as advised in writing by outside counsel
and to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Purchaser Confidential
Information. In the event that this Agreement is terminated and the

6.16 _Post-Closing Board of Directors and Executive Officers_.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall take all necessary action, including causing the

officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request of the Purchaser (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") as provided
in the Purchaser\'s Organizational Documents or under any indemnification,
employment or other similar agreements between any DandO Indemnified Person and
the Purchaser, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms to the extent permitted by applicable Law. For a
period of six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause its
Organizational Documents to contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to DandO
Indemnified Persons than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Organizational Documents of Purchaser to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. The provisions of this _Section 6.16(c)_ shall survive the Closing and

the DandO Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives.

  



  

6.17 _Use of Trust Account Proceeds_. The Parties agree that after the

any PIPE Investment, if any, shall first be used (i) to pay the Purchaser's
accrued Expenses, (ii) to pay the Purchaser's deferred Expenses (including any
legal fees) of the IPO and (iii) to pay for any loans or other outstanding
obligations owed by the Purchaser to the Sponsor. Such amounts, as well as
any Expenses that are required or permitted to be paid by delivery of the
Purchaser's securities, will be paid at the Closing. Any remaining cash will
be used for general corporate purposes. In the event that at the Closing, the
Purchaser does not have sufficient funds to pay in full any loans or other
obligations owed to the Sponsor, the Company will pay such amounts at the
Closing.

  



  

   

49

States with active business and operations in the industries and regions in
which the Target Companies operate and contemplate operating as of the
Closing.

  



  

6.19 _Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) The Purchaser, the Company Parties, Sellers and their respective
Affiliates will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Parties, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Target
Companies (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or
information). The Party requesting such cooperation will pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the other Party in connection with such efforts.

  



  

(b) _PRC Tax Bulletin No. 7_.

  



  

(i) The Parties hereby acknowledge, covenant and agree that (x) the Purchaser
shall have no obligation to pay any Tax assessed by the applicable PRC
Governmental Authority on the Sellers, or any other Tax of a nature that is
required by applicable Law to be paid by the Sellers with respect to the sale
of the Purchased Shares pursuant to this Agreement, and (y) the Sellers agree
to bear and pay any Tax assessed by the applicable PRC Governmental Authority
on any Target Company with respect to the sale of the Purchased Shares
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) The Sellers shall (x) at their own expense, as soon as possible within
thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date, report the sale of the Purchased Shares to the applicable PRC
Governmental Authority in accordance with the reporting provisions under the
PRC State Administration of Taxation's Bulletin on Several Issues of
Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property
by Non-resident Enterprises (the PRC State Administration of Taxation
Bulletin [2015] No. 7, dated February 3, 2015, as amended, supplemented,
modified or interpreted from time to time by any implementing rules and
regulations, and any successor rule or regulation thereof under the Laws of
the PRC, the " _PRC Tax Bulletin No. 7_ ") (and make such filings and
disclosures in accordance therewith) and (y) timely pay any Tax assessed by
the applicable PRC Governmental Authority (to the extent that such PRC
Governmental Authority requires any Taxes to be paid) on any Target
Company with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law. After such Tax reporting, the Target
Companies and Sellers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly submit all documents lawfully requested by the applicable PRC
Governmental Authority in connection with such Tax reporting and shall deliver
to the Purchaser a duplicate of the PRC Tax Bulletin No. 7 filing documents
as well as a copy of proof issued by the applicable PRC Governmental Authority
with respect to any Tax payment made by the Sellers pursuant to this
subsection (ii) (or written assessment notice issued by the PRC Governmental
Authority if payment is not required).

  



  

(iii) The Purchaser shall have the right, but is under no obligation, to make
applicable tax filings with a relevant PRC Governmental Authority, and the
Sellers and the Target Companies shall cooperate in good faith in the
Purchaser's filing, if any, and provide all necessary assistance and
information of the Sellers and the Target Companies to the Purchaser in a
timely manner, provided that the Purchaser's failure to so make the filings
shall not relieve the Sellers from any obligation to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser in this regard.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

6.20 _PIPE Investment_. Without limiting anything to the contrary contained
herein, during the Interim Period, Purchaser may, but shall not be required
to, enter into and consummate subscription agreements with investors relating
to a private equity investment in Purchaser to purchase shares of Purchaser
(" _PIPE Shares_ ") in connection with a private placement, and/or enter into
backstop arrangements with potential investors, in either case on terms
mutually agreeable to the Company and the Purchaser, acting reasonably (a "
_PIPE Investment_ "), and, if Purchaser elects to seek a PIPE Investment, the
Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, cooperate with each other and their respective
Representatives in connection with such PIPE Investment and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such PIPE Investment to
occur (including having the Company's senior management participate in any
investor meetings and roadshows as reasonably requested by the Purchaser).

Authorities that the registration described in clause (ii) above has
been completed may be delivered by the Company Parties after September 16,
2019.

contained in this Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits hereto and
all certificates, documents, instruments and undertakings furnished by any
Company Party, any Seller or the Seller Representative pursuant to this
Agreement), including any indemnification obligations, shall survive the

any further obligations, nor shall any claim be asserted or action be brought
against the Purchaser, the Purchaser Representative or their respective
Representatives with respect thereto. The covenants and agreements made by the
Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Representative in this Agreement or in any
certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any
rights arising out of any breach of such covenants or agreements, shall not
survive the Closing, except for those covenants and agreements

severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Purchaser
Representative and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, successors and permitted assigns (each, with
respect to any claim made pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , an " _Indemnitee_
") from and against any and all losses, Actions, Orders, Liabilities, damages
(including consequential damages), diminution in value, Taxes, interest,
penalties, Liens, amounts paid in settlement, costs and expenses (including
reasonable expenses of investigation and court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (any of the foregoing, a " _Loss_ ")

delivered by any Company Party, any Seller, the Seller Representative or the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement; (c) any and all Liabilities for Taxes
(i) in connection with or arising out of the Target Companies' activities or
business on or before the Closing Date, (ii) owing by any Person (other than
a Target Company) for which a Target Company is liable where the Liability of
the Target Company for such Taxes is attributable to an event or transaction
occurring on or before the Closing Date, or (iii) attributable to or assessed
on the proceeds of the sale of the Purchased Shares contemplated under this
Agreement; or (d) any Action by Person(s) who were holders of equity
securities of a Target Company, including options, warrants, convertible debt
or other convertible securities or other rights to acquire equity securities

Losses incurred by the Indemnitees for which they are otherwise entitled to
indemnification under this _Article VII_ exceeds Two Million One Hundred
Twenty-Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($2,125,000) (the " _Basket_ "), in which
case the Indemnitors shall be obligated to the Indemnitees for the amount of
all Losses of the Indemnitees from the first dollar of Losses of the
Indemnitees required to reach the Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Basket shall not apply to (i) indemnification claims for breaches of any

52

 



    



  

(b) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments to which the
Indemnitors will be obligated to pay in the aggregate (i) under clause (a) of
_Section 7.2_ (other than claims for breach of any Special Representations or
any Fraud Claims) shall not exceed an amount equal to the value of the Escrow
Property in the Escrow Account in accordance with this Agreement, plus the
value of the Earnout Shares (based on the then current Purchaser Share
Price), or (ii) under _Section 7.2_ as a whole (other than Fraud Claims)
shall not exceed an amount equal to the Company Equity Valuation.

  



  

(c) For all purposes of this _Article VII_ , including for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach giving rise to
the indemnification claim and the amount of Losses, all of the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement (including the disclosure schedules hereto) or any Ancillary
Document that are qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or words
of similar import or effect will be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification.

Representative, any other Indemnitee or their respective Representatives of a
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any Company
Party, the Seller Representative, any Seller or any other Indemnitor shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of any
Company Party, the Seller Representative, any Seller or any other Indemnitor
or the recourse available to any Indemnitee under any provision of this
Agreement, including this _Article VII_ , with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) The amount of any Losses suffered or incurred by any Indemnitee shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to the Indemnitee or any
Affiliate thereof as a reimbursement with respect to such Losses (and no right
of subrogation shall accrue to any insurer hereunder, except to the extent
that such waiver of subrogation would prejudice any applicable insurance
coverage), net of the costs of collection and the increases in insurance
premiums resulting from such Loss or insurance payment.

(a) The Purchaser Representative shall have the sole right to act on behalf

Seller Representative shall have the sole right to act on behalf of the
Indemnitors with respect to any indemnification claims made pursuant to this
_Article VII_ , including defending and settling any indemnification claims
hereunder and receiving any notices on behalf of the Indemnitors.

  



  

(b) In order to make a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Purchaser
Representative on behalf of an Indemnitee must provide written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") of such claim to the Seller Representative on behalf of the
Indemnitors and, prior to the Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent, which Claim
Notice shall include (i) a reasonable description of the facts
and circumstances which relate to the subject matter of such indemnification
claim to the extent then known and (ii) the amount of Losses suffered by the
Indemnitee in connection with the claim to the extent known or reasonably
estimable (provided, that the Purchaser Representative may thereafter in good
faith adjust the amount of Losses with respect to the claim by providing a
revised Claim Notice to the Seller Representative (and, so long as any Escrow
Property remains in the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent);  _provided_ , that
the copy of any Claim Notice provided to the Escrow Agent shall be redacted
for any confidential or proprietary information of the Indemnitor or the
Indemnitee described in clause (i).

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(c) In the case of any claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_
arising from a claim of a third party (including any Governmental Authority)
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Purchaser Representative must give a Claim
Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim to the Seller Representative
promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the
Indemnitee's receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that
the failure to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations except to the extent that the defense of such
Third Party Claim is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the failure to
give such notice. The Seller Representative will have the right to defend and
to direct the defense against any such Third Party Claim in its name and at
its expense, and with counsel selected by the Seller Representative
unless (i) the Seller Representative fails to acknowledge fully to the
Purchaser Representative the obligations of the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee
within twenty (20) days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim or
contests, in whole or in part, its indemnification obligations therefor or
(ii) at any time while such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) there is a
conflict of interest between the Seller Representative on behalf of the
Indemnitor and the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee in the
conduct of such defense, (B) the applicable third party alleges a Fraud
Claim, (C) such claim is criminal in nature, could reasonably be expected to
lead to criminal proceedings, or seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnitee or (D) the amount of the Third Party Claim exceeds or
is reasonably expected to exceed the value of the remaining Escrow Property in
the Escrow Account (after deducting any amounts for pending but unresolved
indemnification claims and resolved but unpaid indemnification claims). If
the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor elects, and is entitled,
to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, it will within twenty (20)
days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify
the Purchaser Representative of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser
Representative and the Indemnitee will, at the request and expense of the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor, cooperate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim. If the Seller Representative on behalf of
the Indemnitor elects not to, or at any time is not entitled under this
_Section 7.4_ to, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to
notify the Purchaser Representative of its election as herein provided or
refuses to acknowledge or contests its obligation to indemnify under this
Agreement, the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee may pay,
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Indemnitor will have no
indemnification obligations with respect to any such Third Party Claim which
is settled by the Indemnitee or the Purchaser Representative without the
prior written consent of the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee
will not be required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim which has
matured by a final, non-appealable Order, nor will it be required to
refrain from paying any Third Party Claim where the delay in paying such
claim would result in the foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the property or
assets then held by the Indemnitee or where any delay in payment would cause
the Indemnitee material economic loss. The Seller Representative's right on
behalf of the Indemnitor to direct the defense will include the right to
compromise or enter into an agreement settling any Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , that no such compromise or settlement will obligate the
Indemnitee to agree to any settlement that that requires the taking or
restriction of any action (including the payment of money and competition
restrictions) by the Indemnitee other than the execution of a release for such
Third Party Claim and/or agreeing to be subject to customary confidentiality
obligations in connection therewith, except with the prior written consent of
the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee (such consent to be
withheld, conditioned or delayed only for a good faith
reason). Notwithstanding the Seller Representative's right on behalf of the
Indemnitor to compromise or settle in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor may
not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim over the objection of the
Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee; provided, however, that
consent by the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee to
settlement or compromise will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee will
have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by it subject to the Seller Representative's right on behalf
of the Indemnitor to direct the defense.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

(d) With respect to any direct indemnification claim that is not a Third
Party Claim, the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor will have
a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice to respond
thereto. If the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor does not
respond within such thirty (30) days, the Seller Representative on behalf of
the Indemnitor will be deemed to have accepted responsibility for the Losses
set forth in such Claim Notice subject to the limitations on
indemnification set forth in this _Article VII_ and will have no further
right to contest the validity of such Claim Notice. If the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor responds within such thirty
(30) days after the receipt of the Claim Notice and rejects such claim in
whole or in part, the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee
will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available under this Agreement
(subject to _Section 11.4_ ), any Ancillary Documents or applicable Law.

  



  

7.5 _Timing of Payment; Right to Set-Off; Recovery of Shares_.

  



  

(a) Any indemnification claims against the Indemnitors shall first be applied
against the Escrow Shares and then against any other Escrow Property before
any Indemnitor shall be required to make any out-of-pocket payment for
indemnification. The sole source of recovery of the Indemnitees with respect
to any indemnification claim made under clause (a) of _Section 7.2_ (other
than claims for breach of any Special Representations or any Fraud Claims)
shall be the Escrow Property in the Escrow Account and any Earnout Shares.

  



  

(b) Any indemnification obligation of an Indemnitor under this Article VII
will be paid within five (5) Business Days after the determination of such
obligation in accordance with Section 7.4 (and the Purchaser Representative
and the Seller Representative will provide or cause to be provided to the
Escrow Agent any written instructions or other information or documents
required by the Escrow Agent to do so). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any indemnification payments will be made to the
Purchaser or its successors. With respect to any indemnification payment, the
value of each Escrow Share, Earnout Share or any other Purchaser Ordinary
Shares for purposes of determining the indemnification payment shall be the
Purchaser Share Price on the date that the indemnification claim is finally
determined in accordance with this _Article VII_. Any Escrow Shares, Earnout
Shares or other Purchaser Ordinary Shares received by the Purchaser as an
indemnification payment shall be promptly cancelled by the Purchaser after
its receipt thereof.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Article VII_ notwithstanding, at the sole
discretion of the Purchaser Representative and without limiting any other
rights of the Purchaser or any other Indemnitee under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document or at law or equity, to the extent that it is established
that the Purchaser or another Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, if a Indemnitor fails or refuses to promptly indemnify the
Purchaser or such other Indemnitee as provided herein then the Purchaser may,
at the sole election of the Purchaser Representative, (i) offset the full
amount to which the Purchaser or such other Indemnitee is entitled, in whole
or in part, by reducing the amount of any payment or other obligation due to
the Sellers or such other Indemnitor pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, including by offsetting such indemnification obligations
against any Earnout Shares otherwise required to be delivered to the Sellers
under this Agreement and/or (ii) claim a portion of the Purchaser Ordinary
Shares then owned by such Indemnitor up to an amount equal in value (based on
the then current Purchaser Share Price) to the amount owed by such
Indemnitor. In the event that such Indemnitor fails to promptly transfer any
such Purchaser Ordinary Shares pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ , the Purchaser
Representative on behalf of the Purchaser shall be and hereby is authorized as
the attorney-in-fact for such Indemnitor to transfer such Purchaser Ordinary
Shares to the proper recipient thereof as required by this _Section 7.5_  and
may transfer such Purchaser Ordinary Shares and cancel the share certificates
for such Purchaser Ordinary Shares on the books and records of the Purchaser
and issue new share certificates to such transferee and may instruct its
agents and any exchanges on which Purchaser Ordinary Shares are listed or
traded to do the same.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

7.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except with respect to
Fraud Claims relating to any Target Company or any Seller or claims seeking
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief (including
pursuant to _Section 11.7_ ), or claims under the terms of the Ancillary
Documents, indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect to matters arising under
this Agreement of any kind or nature, including for any misrepresentation or
breach of any warranty, covenant, or other provision contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
including the negotiation and discussion thereof.

prior to September 16, 2019 (provided, that upon the Company delivering the
Draft Audited Financial Statements to the Purchaser after September 16, 2019,
the Purchaser shall not be permitted thereafter to terminate under this
_Section 9.1(j)(i))_ , or (ii) if the Final Audited Financial Statements are
materially different from the Draft Audited Financial Statements in an
adverse manner, including any of the consolidated revenues, net income before
taxes, or assets being more than five percent (5%) less than the amounts set
forth in the Draft Audited Financial Statements or the consolidated
liabilities being more than five percent (5%) greater than the amounts set
forth in the Draft Audited Financial Statements.

  



  

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. This Agreement may only be terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section 9.1_ and pursuant to a written notice
delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable Parties, which sets
forth the basis for such termination, including the provision of _Section
9.1_ under which such termination is made. In the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability on the part of
any Party or any of their respective Representatives, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i)  _Sections 6.12_, _6.13_
, _9.3_ , _9.4_ , _10.1_ , _Article XI_ and this _Section 9.2_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from Liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any Fraud Claim against such
Party, in either case, prior to termination of this Agreement (in each case
of clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to _Section 10.1_ ). Without
limiting the foregoing, and except as provided in _Sections 9.3_ and _9.4_
and this _Section 9.2_ , but subject to _Section 10.1_ , and subject to the
right to seek injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief in
accordance with _Section 11.7_ ), the Parties' sole right prior to the
Closing with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement by another Party or
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the
right, if applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

  



  

9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Sections 6.17_ , _9.4_ , _10.1_ ,
_11.14_ and _11.15_ all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring
such expenses. As used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " shall include all
out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors, financing sources,
experts and consultants to a Party hereto or any of its Affiliates) incurred
by a Party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document related hereto and all other matters
related to the consummation of this Agreement. With respect to Purchaser,
Expenses shall include any and all deferred expenses (including fees or
commissions payable to the underwriters and any legal fees) of the IPO upon
consummation of a Business Combination and any expenses incurred in
connection with any Extension.

  



  

9.4 _Termination Fee_. Notwithstanding _Section 9.3_ above, in the event that
there is a valid and effective termination of this Agreement by the Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ , then the Company Parties shall jointly and
severally pay to the Purchaser a termination fee equal to Six Hundred Thirty-
Nine Thousand U.S. Dollars ($639,000), plus the Expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, including any related SEC filings, the Solicitation Documents,
any Redemption and any PIPE Investment (such aggregate amount, the "
_Termination Fee_ "). The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days after the Purchaser delivers to the
Company the amount of such Expenses, along with reasonable documentation in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to
any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee
is payable, the payment of the Termination Fee shall, in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which the
Purchaser would otherwise be entitled to assert against any Company Party or
any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
shareholders with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to the
Purchaser, provided, that the foregoing shall not limit (x) any Company Party
or any Seller from Liability for any Fraud Claim relating to events occurring
prior to termination of this Agreement or (y) the rights of the Purchaser to
seek specific performance or other injunctive relief in lieu of terminating
this Agreement.

Article X _ 
 WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

  



  

10.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Each Company Party and each Seller
hereby acknowledges that it has read the IPO Prospectus and understands that
the Purchaser has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the
IPO and the overallotment shares acquired by the Purchaser's underwriters and
from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO
(including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of the
Purchaser's public shareholders (including overallotment shares acquired by
the Purchaser's underwriters) (the " _Public Shareholders_ ") and that, except
as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus, the Purchaser may disburse
monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Shareholders in the
event they elect to redeem or convert their Purchaser Ordinary Shares in
connection with the consummation of the Purchaser's initial business
combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) (" _Business
Combination_ ") or in connection with an amendment to the Purchaser's
Organizational Documents to extend the Purchaser's deadline to consummate its
Business Combination, (b) to the Public Shareholders if the Purchaser fails to
consummate a Business Combination within eighteen (18) months after the
closing of the IPO (or up to twenty-two (22) months from the closing of the
IPO if the Purchaser extends such period by issuing additional Purchaser
Public Warrants as contemplated by the IPO Prospectus and the Purchaser's
Organizational Documents), (c) with respect to any interest income earned on
the amounts held in the Trust Account, amounts necessary to pay for franchise
and income taxes or (d) to the Purchaser after or concurrently with the
consummation of its Business Combination. For and in consideration of the
Purchaser entering into this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
each Company Party and each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of the Company Parties or any Seller, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account
or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim
arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this
Agreement, any other proposed or actual business relationship between the
Purchaser or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Company Party or any Seller or any of their respective Representatives, on
the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim
arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability
(collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "). Each Company Party and each Seller
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released
Claims that any such Party of any of its Affiliates may have against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
Purchaser or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement
with Purchaser or its Affiliates). Each Company Party and each Seller agrees
and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement
and specifically relied upon by the Purchaser and its Affiliates to induce
the Purchaser to enter in this Agreement, and each Company Party and each
Seller further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and
enforceable against such Party and each of its Affiliates under applicable
Law. To the extent that any Company Party, any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates commences any Action based upon, in connection with,
relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser or its
Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief
against the Purchaser or its Representatives, each Company Party and each
Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that its and its Affiliates' sole
remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that
such claim shall not permit such Party or any of its Affiliates (or any other
Person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any
claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any
amounts contained therein. In the event that any Company Party, any Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates commences any Action based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the
Purchaser or its Representatives which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
relief against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or
the Public Shareholders, whether in the form of money damages or injunctive
relief, the Purchaser and its Representatives, as applicable, shall be
entitled to recover from the commencing Person and its Affiliates the
associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such Action, in the
event the Purchaser or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such
Action. This _Section 10.1_ shall survive termination of this Agreement for
any reason and continue indefinitely.

  



  

10.2 _Release and Covenant Not to Sue_. Effective as of the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates that owns any share or other equity interest in or of such
Seller (the " _Releasing Persons_ "), hereby releases and discharges the
Target Companies from and against any and all Actions, obligations,
agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both
at law and in equity, which such Releasing Person now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have against the Target Companies arising on or prior to the
Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date, including any rights to indemnification or
reimbursement from a Target Company, whether pursuant to its Organizational
Documents, Contract or otherwise, and whether or not relating to claims
pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date. From and after the Closing,
each Releasing Person hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly
or indirectly, asserting any Action, or commencing or causing to be
commenced, any Action of any kind against the Target Companies or their
respective Affiliates, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the releases and
restrictions set forth herein shall not apply to any claims a Releasing Person
may have against any party pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the other matters set forth on
_Schedule 10.2_.

11.2 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller Representative (and, if
after the Closing, the Purchaser Representative), and any assignment without
such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

11.3 _Third Parties_. Except for the rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons
set forth in _Section 6.16(c)_ , which the Parties acknowledge and agree are
express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument or document executed by any party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights
in, or be deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is
not a Party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a
Party.

  



  

11.4 _Arbitration_. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other
than disputes subject to the procedures under _Section 1.4_ or
applications for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for
enforcement of a resolution under this _Section 11.4_ ) arising out of,
related to, or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Dispute_ ") shall be governed by this
_Section 11.4_. A party must, in the first instance, provide written notice
of any Disputes to the other parties subject to such Dispute, which notice
must provide a reasonably detailed description of the matters subject to the
Dispute. The parties involved in such Dispute shall seek to resolve the
Dispute on an amicable basis within ten (10) Business Days of the notice of
such Dispute being received by such other parties subject to such Dispute;
the " _Resolution Period_ "); provided, that if any Dispute would reasonably
be expected to have become moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within
sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall be no
Resolution Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not
resolved during the Resolution Period may immediately be referred to and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to the then-existing Expedited
Procedures (as defined in the AAA Procedures) of the Commercial Arbitration
Rules (the " _AAA Procedures_ ") of the AAA. Any party involved in such
Dispute may submit the Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after
the Resolution Period. To the extent that the AAA Procedures and this
Agreement are in conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall control. The
arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator nominated by the AAA
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the
submission of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each party
subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with
substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The
arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration
process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or
her nomination and acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The
proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide
the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York.
Time is of the essence. Each party subject to the Dispute shall submit a
proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20)
days after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator
shall have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from doing,
anything consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
applicable Law, including to perform its contractual obligation(s);
provided, that the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the
foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant
party (or parties, as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the
proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a
reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's reason(s) for selecting one or the
other proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of
New York. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

11.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Subject to _Section
11.4_ , all Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in any state or federal court located in New
York, New York (or in any appellate court thereof) (the " _Specified Courts_
"). Subject to _Section 11.4_ , each Party hereto hereby (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified Court for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party hereto and
(b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or
by any Specified Court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any other Action relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on behalf of itself, or its property, by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such Party at the applicable address set forth in
_Section 11.1_. Nothing in this _Section 11.5_ shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  



  

11.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial
by jury with respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Party hereto (a) certifies that no Representative of any other
Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would
not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto have been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 11.6_.

  



  

11.7 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-
breaching Parties may have not adequate remedy at law, and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by an applicable Party in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or restraining order to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other security
or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to
any other right or remedy to which such Party may be entitled under this
Agreement, at law or in equity.

  



  

11.8 _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

11.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by execution of a written instrument signed by the Purchaser,
the Company, the Seller Representative and, if after the Closing, the
Purchaser Representative.

  



  

11.10 _Waiver_. The Purchaser on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, the
Company on behalf of itself, the other Company Parties and its
Affiliates, and the Seller Representative on behalf of itself and the
Sellers, may in its sole discretion (i) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other non-Affiliated Party
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties by
such other non-Affiliated Party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by such other non-Affiliated Party
with any covenant or condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
Party or Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement
after the Closing by the Purchaser shall also require the prior written
consent of the Purchaser Representative.

  



  

11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents or instruments
referred to herein, including any exhibits, annexes and schedules attached
hereto, which exhibits, annexes and schedules are incorporated herein by
reference, together with the Ancillary Documents, embody the entire agreement
and understanding of the Parties hereto in respect of the subject matter
contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations,
warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or
referred to herein or the documents or instruments referred to herein, which
collectively supersede all prior agreements and the understandings among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein.

  



  

11.12 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and the Article and Section
headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the purpose of
reference, are not part of the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any
way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this
Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) any pronoun used in this

ANNEX II 
  _Calculation of Purchaser Adjusted Net Income_

  



  

The consolidated net income of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall be
adjusted as follows to determine the Purchaser Adjusted Net Income used in
connection with the determinations of whether the Earnout Targets or the
Alternative Earnout Target have been achieved and whether Earnout Shares will
be issued under  _Section 1.4_ of the Agreement:

  



   | 1.| To deduct the following: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Any income in respect of any extraordinary gains (such as from
the sale of real property, investments, securities or fixed assets) or any
other extraordinary income; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Any revenues attributable to a discontinued business; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Any revenues that are non-recurring and earned outside of the
ordinary course of business. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| To add back the following: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Any expenses attributable to a discontinued business; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Any contingent consideration fair value change as a result of the
issuance of the Earnout Shares; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Any share-based compensation expense. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| If after the Closing and prior to the end of the Earnout Period,
the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries acquires another entity or business, then
the Purchaser Adjusted Net Income shall be computed without taking into
consideration (a) the financial results of such acquired entity or business
or (b) any impact such acquired entity or business would have on the
consolidated financial results of the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any accounting term that is used herein but not defined in the Agreement
shall have the meaning normally ascribed to such term under GAAP.
