for share splits, share dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like after the Closing, including to account for any

Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative (each, a &ldquo;<B><I>Representative Party</I></B>&rdquo;) a written statement

(ii) for the 2020 Earnout Year only, the aggregate Purchaser Adjusted Net Income for both Earnout Years combined based on such

are entitled to receive Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year as a result of achieving the applicable Earnout Target or, with respect
to the 2020 Earnout Year only, the Aggregate Earnout Target. Each Representative Party will have thirty (30) days after its receipt
of an Earnout Statement to review it. The Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative, and their respective Representatives
on their behalves, may make inquiries of the CFO and related Purchaser and Company personnel and advisors regarding questions concerning
or disagreements with the Earnout Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser and the Company shall
provide reasonable cooperation in connection therewith. If either Representative Party has any objections to the Earnout Statement,
such Representative Party shall deliver to the Company (to the attention of the CFO) and the other Representative Party a statement
setting forth its objections thereto (in reasonable detail) (an &ldquo;<B><I>Objection Statement</I></B>&rdquo;). If an Objection
Statement is not delivered by a Representative Party within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Earnout Statement,
then such Representative Party will have waived its right to contest the Earnout Statement, and all determinations and calculations
set forth therein, and whether the Sellers have earned the Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year (or have otherwise achieved the
Alternative Earnout). If an Objection Statement is delivered within such thirty (30) day period, then the Seller Representative
and the Purchaser Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections for a period of twenty (20) days
thereafter. If the Seller Representative and the Purchaser Representative do not reach a final resolution within such twenty (20)
day period, then upon the written request of either Representative Party (the date of receipt of such notice by the other Representative
Party, the &ldquo;<B><I>Independent Expert Notice Date</I></B>&rdquo;), the Representative Parties will refer the dispute to the

carrier relating to or involving any adverse change or any change other than in the ordinary course of business, in the conditions
of insurance, any refusal to issue an insurance policy or non-renewal of a policy, or requiring or suggesting material alteration
of any of assets of a Target Company, purchase of additional equipment or material modification of any of methods of doing business

4.22(b)</U> identifies each individual insurance claim in excess of $50,000 made by a Target Company since January 1, 2016. Each
Target Company has reported to its insurers all claims and pending circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in
a claim, except where such failure to report such a claim would not be reasonably likely to be material to the Target Companies.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected
to (with or without notice or lapse of time) give rise to or serve as a basis for the denial of any such insurance claim. No Target
Company has made any claim against an insurance policy as to which the insurer is denying coverage.</P>

the case of any claim for indemnification under this <U>Article VII</U> arising from a claim of a third party (including any Governmental
Authority) (a &ldquo;<B><I>Third Party Claim</I></B>&rdquo;), the Purchaser Representative must give a Claim Notice with respect
to such Third Party Claim to the Seller Representative promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the Indemnitee&rsquo;s
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, that the failure to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnitor
of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially and irrevocably
prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. The Seller Representative will have the right to defend and to direct the defense
against any such Third Party Claim in its name and at its expense, and with counsel selected by the Seller Representative unless
(i) the Seller Representative fails to acknowledge fully to the Purchaser Representative the obligations of the Indemnitor to the
Indemnitee within twenty (20) days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim or contests, in whole or in part, its indemnification
obligations therefor or (ii) at any time while such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) there is a conflict of interest between the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor and the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee in the conduct of
such defense, (B) the applicable third party alleges a Fraud Claim, (C) such claim is criminal in nature, could reasonably be expected
to lead to criminal proceedings, or seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee or (D) the amount of the
Third Party Claim exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the value of the remaining Escrow Property in the Escrow Account
(after deducting any amounts for pending but unresolved indemnification claims and resolved but unpaid indemnification claims).
If the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor elects, and is entitled, to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim,
it will within twenty (20) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the Purchaser Representative
of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser Representative and the Indemnitee will, at the request and expense of the Seller Representative
on behalf of the Indemnitor, cooperate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Seller Representative on behalf of the
Indemnitor elects not to, or at any time is not entitled under this <U>Section 7.4</U> to, compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim, fails to notify the Purchaser Representative of its election as herein provided or refuses to acknowledge or contests its
obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend
such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnitor will have no indemnification
obligations with respect to any such Third Party Claim which is settled by the Indemnitee or the Purchaser Representative without
the prior written consent of the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee will not be required
to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim which has matured by a final, non-appealable Order, nor will it be required to refrain
from paying any Third Party Claim where the delay in paying such claim would result in the foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the
property or assets then held by the Indemnitee or where any delay in payment would cause the Indemnitee material economic loss.
The Seller Representative&rsquo;s right on behalf of the Indemnitor to direct the defense will include the right to compromise
or enter into an agreement settling any Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, that no such compromise or settlement will obligate
the Indemnitee to agree to any settlement that that requires the taking or restriction of any action (including the payment of
money and competition restrictions) by the Indemnitee other than the execution of a release for such Third Party Claim and/or agreeing
to be subject to customary confidentiality obligations in connection therewith, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser
Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee (such consent to be withheld, conditioned or delayed only for a good faith reason).
Notwithstanding the Seller Representative&rsquo;s right on behalf of the Indemnitor to compromise or settle in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller Representative on behalf of the Indemnitor may not settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim over the objection of the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee; provided, however, that consent by
the Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee to settlement or compromise will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned. The Purchaser Representative on behalf of the Indemnitee will have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Seller Representative&rsquo;s right on behalf of the Indemnitor to
direct the defense.</P>

of Claims Against Trust</U>. Each Company Party and each Seller hereby acknowledges that it has read the IPO Prospectus and understands
that the Purchaser has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and the overallotment shares acquired by
the Purchaser&rsquo;s underwriters and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of the Purchaser&rsquo;s public shareholders (including overallotment shares
acquired by the Purchaser&rsquo;s underwriters) (the &ldquo;<B><I>Public Shareholders</I></B>&rdquo;) and that, except as otherwise
described in the IPO Prospectus, the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Shareholders
in the event they elect to redeem or convert their Purchaser Ordinary Shares in connection with the consummation of the Purchaser&rsquo;s
initial business combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) (&ldquo;<B><I>Business Combination</I></B>&rdquo;) or
in connection with an amendment to the Purchaser&rsquo;s Organizational Documents to extend the Purchaser&rsquo;s deadline to consummate
its Business Combination, (b) to the Public Shareholders if the Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within eighteen
(18) months after the closing of the IPO (or up to twenty-two (22) months from the closing of the IPO if the Purchaser extends
such period by issuing additional Purchaser Public Warrants as contemplated by the IPO Prospectus and the Purchaser&rsquo;s Organizational
Documents), (c) with respect to any interest income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, amounts necessary to pay for
franchise and income taxes or (d) to the Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation of its Business Combination. For
and in consideration of the Purchaser entering into this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each Company Party and each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company Parties or any Seller, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the
Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom),
regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement, any other
proposed or actual business relationship between the Purchaser or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Company
Party or any Seller or any of their respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether
such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity&nbsp;or any other theory of legal liability (collectively, the &ldquo;<B><I>Released
Claims</I></B>&rdquo;). Each Company Party and each Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any
Released Claims that any such Party of any of its Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom)
now or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Purchaser or its Representatives
and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including
for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with Purchaser or its Affiliates). Each Company Party and each Seller
agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Purchaser
and its Affiliates to induce the Purchaser to enter in this Agreement, and each Company Party and each Seller further intends and
understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against such Party and each of its Affiliates under applicable Law.
To the extent that any Company Party, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates commences any Action based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole
or in part, monetary relief against the Purchaser or its Representatives, each Company Party and each Seller hereby acknowledges
and agrees that its and its Affiliates&rsquo; sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit such Party or any of its Affiliates (or any other Person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of
them) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In
the event that any Company Party, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates commences any Action based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser or its Representatives which proceeding seeks, in whole
or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or the Public Shareholders, whether in the
form of money damages or injunctive relief, the Purchaser and its Representatives, as applicable, shall be entitled to recover
from the commencing Person and its Affiliates the associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such Action, in the event
the Purchaser or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such Action. This <U>Section 10.1</U> shall survive termination
of this Agreement for any reason and continue indefinitely.</P>

hereby releases and discharges the Target Companies from and against any and all Actions, obligations, agreements, debts and Liabilities

Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other than disputes subject to the procedures under <U>Section 1.4</U> or applications
for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for enforcement
of a resolution under this <U>Section 11.4</U>) arising out of, related to, or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (a &ldquo;<B><I>Dispute</I></B>&rdquo;) shall be governed by this <U>Section 11.4</U>. A party must, in the
first instance, provide written notice of any Disputes to the other parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide
a reasonably detailed description of the matters subject to the Dispute. The parties involved in such Dispute shall seek to resolve
the Dispute on an amicable basis within ten (10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such other parties
subject to such Dispute; the &ldquo;<B><I>Resolution Period</I></B>&rdquo;); provided, that if any Dispute would reasonably be
expected to have become moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Dispute,
then there shall be no Resolution Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not resolved during the Resolution Period
may immediately be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to the then-existing Expedited Procedures (as defined
in the AAA Procedures) of the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;<B><I>AAA Procedures</I></B>&rdquo;) of the AAA. Any party
involved in such Dispute may submit the Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after the Resolution Period. To the extent
that the AAA Procedures and this Agreement are in conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall control. The arbitration shall be
conducted by one arbitrator nominated by the AAA promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the submission
of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial
lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment
and begin the arbitration process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or her nomination and acceptance
by the parties subject to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide the Dispute
in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York. Time is of the essence. Each party subject to the Dispute shall
submit a proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after confirmation of the appointment
of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything consistent
with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law, including to perform its contractual obligation(s); provided,
