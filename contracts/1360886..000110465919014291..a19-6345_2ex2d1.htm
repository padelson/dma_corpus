 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **The Offer**

 



 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_ _._ No earlier than five (5) business days
(and no later than fifteen (15) business days) after the date of this
Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock at a price per share equal to the Offer Price (as
adjusted as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_, if applicable).

 



 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_ _._ The obligations of Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the conditions
set forth in Annex I (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer Conditions are
for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub, and Parent and Sub may waive, in whole
or in part, any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, in their
sole discretion, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may be waived
by Parent and Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. Parent
and Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or previously
approved by the Company in writing, Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit
Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Tender Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or
supplement any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to the holders of Company
Common Stock, or (vi) extend the expiration date of the Offer in any manner
other than in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.01(d)_.

 



 

(c) _Adjustments to Offer Price_ _._ The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash

 



     

 

 



 

dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to Company Common
Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to Subs
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in
the Offer; _provided_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section 1.01_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and
(ii) share repurchases and grants of equity compensation solely to the extent
expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement, shall not result in any
adjustment to the Offer Price.

 



 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_ _._ The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the 21st business
day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) (such date being the " _Initial Offer Expiration Date_
"), _provided_ , _however_ , that if at the Initial Offer Expiration Date, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied (other than any Offer Conditions that are by
their nature to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time) or waived, Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer for a period determined by Parent
of not more than ten (10) business days. Thereafter, if at any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition is not satisfied or waived, Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) business days (the
length of such periods to be determined by Parent); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and Sub shall in no circumstance be required to extend the Offer
to a date subsequent to the Outside Date. In addition, (x) Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for the
minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or
NASDAQ Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer and (y) Sub may, and Parent may cause Sub to, make available a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-11.

 



 

(e) _Payment_ _._ On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, accept for payment,
and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 3 business days) after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as
it may be extended in accordance with _Section 1.01(d)_) and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The payment
for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_."

 



 

(f) _Termination of the Offer_ _._ If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.01_, then Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
business day of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 9.01_,
Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered
holders thereof to the extent required by the terms of the Offer.

 



 

(g) _Offer Documents_ _._ On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
and including all exhibits

 



     

 

 



 

thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and
other ancillary Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such
Schedule TO and the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and promptly
thereafter shall mail the Offer Documents to the holders of the Company Common
Stock as required by applicable Law. Parent and Sub shall timely cause a
notice that satisfies the requirements of Section 3-106.1(e)(1) of the MGCL
(such notice, the " _Maryland Short Form Notice_") to be given to the holders
of the Company Common Stock with the Offer Documents, unless, prior to the
date the Offer is first commenced, the Maryland Short Form Notice has been
given to the holders of the Company Common Stock who, except for the
application of Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL, would be entitled to vote on the
Merger on the date such notice is given or on a record date fixed for that
purpose that is not more than ten (10) days before the date that notice is
given. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Sub all information
concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities laws or
reasonably requested by Parent or Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents.
The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Board Actions and the Recommendation of the board of directors of the Company
(the " _Company Board_ "). Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable federal securities
Laws. Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all written
correspondence between Parent, Sub and their respective Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Parent
and Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to
the Offer Documents, and Parent and Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
written response to any such written comments of the SEC or its staff.

 



 

Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock,
or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response.

 



 

(h) _Funds_ _._ Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Offer Conditions, Sub shall provide, and Parent shall cause Sub to
provide, to a paying agent (which shall be a reputable bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company) selected by Sub (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. In
connection therewith and with _Section 3.03_, Sub shall enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

 



     

 

 



 

(i) _Withholding_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sub and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Sub or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Sub
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_ _._ On the date the Offer Documents are first filed with
the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_"), which shall describe and make the Recommendation with respect to the
Offer and describe the other Board Actions, and promptly thereafter shall mail
the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of the Company Common Stock. The Company
shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9 the Fairness Opinion. Parent and Sub
shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning
Parent and Sub that may be required by applicable securities laws for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
federal securities Laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Sub upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent and Sub with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, and, unless there shall have been an Adverse Recommendation Change made
in accordance with _Section 6.02, _the Company shall provide Parent and Sub
and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff.
Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock,
or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and Sub a reasonable opportunity to

Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder, representation on the Company Board equal to at least that

outstanding that are owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including all
shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer as
being owned as of the Acceptance Time for this purpose); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Parents designees are appointed or elected to the Company
Board, until the Effective Time the Company Board shall have at least three
directors who are members of the Company Board and who are not officers,
stockholders or Affiliates of the Company or Parent and who will be

this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other
directors shall designate three persons to fill such vacancies who are not
officers, stockholders or Affiliates of the Company or Parent and who will be
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this

directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so
elected or appointed to the Company Board in compliance with applicable Law
(including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act). From time to time after the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all

 



     

 

 



 

action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be
directors on the Company Board to constitute substantially the same percentage
(rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on each committee
of the Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Law and
the rules of NASDAQ, and the Company shall take all action requested by Parent
necessary to effect any such election.

 



 

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_ _._ If requested by Parent, the
Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder as is necessary to

basis all information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder with respect to such designees and with respect to Parents
officers, directors and Affiliates, and if not then as soon as practicable
thereafter).

or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ and prior
to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent

amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to waive or elect to enforce any of

the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_ _._ Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_ _._ Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is directly owned by Sub at such time (including all shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, whether or not such
shares are registered in the name of Sub or any of its Affiliates as of the
Effective Time) or by any Subsidiary of the Company, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_ _._ Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights or rights of an
objecting stockholder shall be available with respect to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if there shall be any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to Company Common
Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_
shall be equitably adjusted by Parent to reflect the effect thereof;

 



      

 

 



 

 _provided_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section 3.02_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and (ii) share repurchases
and grants of equity compensation solely to the extent expressly permitted by
the terms of this Agreement, shall not result in any adjustment to the Offer
Price.

 



 

Section 3.03 _Exchange Fund_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_ _._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall deposit,
and Parent shall cause Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_ _._ As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub
to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall
otherwise be in customary form (including customary provisions with respect to
delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry
form)), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record
of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled as promptly as reasonably
practicable. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.03(b)_, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this
_Article III_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_ _._ All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving

 



     

 

 



 

Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this
_Article III_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_ _._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the date that
is six (6) months after the date on which the Effective Time occurs shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or its designee), upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for,
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims
for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_ _._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_ _._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding five billion dollars ($5,000,000,000) (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely
to the Surviving Corporation (or its designee). Nothing contained herein and
no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger
Consideration or any holder of a Company Stock Option to receive the holders
Option Amount, in each case as provided herein.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sub, the
providing of an indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sub, the Surviving Corporation (and, if any withholding applicable
to payments pursuant to _Section 3.04_ is made through a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation, any such Subsidiary) and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration

 



     

 

 



 

otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (or any holder of a Company Stock Option) such amounts as
Sub, the Surviving Corporation (and, if any withholding applicable to payments
pursuant to _Section 3.04_ is made through a Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation, any such Subsidiary) or the Paying Agent are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Sub, the Surviving Corporation
(and, if any withholding applicable to payments pursuant to _Section 3.04_ is
made through a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, any such Subsidiary)
or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock or the holder of the Company Stock Option, as the case may be, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.04 _Company Stock Options_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer,
the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company
Incentive Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as
may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time, each unexercised
Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder
thereof becoming entitled to receive, on the date which the Effective Time
occurs, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any,
of (A) the Offer Price over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
(collectively, all amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.04_, the "
_Option Amounts_ "). The payment of all Option Amounts hereunder shall be
subject to appropriate withholding for Taxes in accordance with _Section
3.03(h)_. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in any
event no later than fifteen (15) calendar days following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall make by a payroll payment through the
Surviving Corporations payroll provider, subject to _Section 3.03(h)_, the
Option Amounts to the applicable holders thereof.

looking in nature, but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be

entity power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except (other than with respect to the Companys due organization and valid
existence) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the charter of the
Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the Bylaws of the Company (the "
_Company Bylaws_ "), in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
are included in the Filed SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 4.02 _Subsidiaries_. _Section 4.02_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists, as of the date of this Agreement, each Subsidiary of the Company and
the jurisdiction of organization thereof. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company

directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens,
charges, mortgages, deeds of trust, encumbrances or security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Permitted
Liens. Except for its interests in its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

other voting securities of or equity interests in, or any security convertible
or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
or equity interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) obligating any such
Subsidiary to issue, grant or enter into any such option, warrant, right,
security, unit, Contract or undertaking, or (iii) that give any person the

outstanding. Except as set forth above, as of the Measurement Time, no shares
of capital stock or other voting securities of or equity interests in the
Company were

Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each Company Stock Option outstanding as
of the Measurement Time, including (to the extent applicable) the Company
Incentive Plan under which such Company Stock Option was granted, and the
price at which such Company Stock Option may be exercised and whether such
Company Stock Option is intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code. Since the Measurement Time, (x) there have

stock or other voting securities of or equity interests in, or any security
convertible or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or equity interest in, the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries
or any Voting Company Debt, (ii) obligating the Company to issue, grant or
enter into any such option, warrant, right, security, unit, Contract,
agreement, arrangement or undertaking, or (iii) that give any person the right
to receive any economic interest of a nature accruing to the holders of
Company Common Stock, and since the Measurement Time, none of the foregoing
has been issued, agreed or entered into. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any

Section 4.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and

has been administered in

 



     

 

 



 

compliance with its terms and with applicable Law (including the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and the
Code), other than instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (to
the extent applicable) (A) each material Company Benefit Plan and each
material Company Benefit Agreement (or, in either case, with respect to any
unwritten material Company Benefit Plan or material Company Benefit Agreement,
a written description thereof), other than any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is prohibited
from making available to Parent as the result of applicable Law relating to
the safeguarding of data privacy, (B) the two most recent annual report on
Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue Service or similar report required

material Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required by applicable
Law), (C) each trust agreement and group annuity contract or other material
contract relating to any material Company Benefit Plan, (D) the most recent
actuarial reports (if applicable) for each Company Benefit Plan and (E) the

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" (or registered)
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
under applicable non-U.S. laws) has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter as to such qualification or registration from the Internal
Revenue Service (or any comparable Governmental Authority), and no event has
occurred, either by reason of any action or failure to act, that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of any such qualification,
registration or Tax-exempt status or the imposition of any material penalty or
Tax liability.

 



 

(d) _Section 4.12(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, each material Company Benefit Plan that provides
health or welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to employees

its Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of service (other than
coverage or benefits (A) required to be provided under Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA, or any other applicable Law, or (B) the full cost of which is borne by
the employee or former employee (or any of their beneficiaries)). Each such
U.S. plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company at any time
without material liability or expense to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, as a result thereof other than claims incurred prior to the
date of such amendment, and no such plan, plan documentation or agreement,
summary plan description or other written communication distributed generally
to employees by its terms prohibits the Company from amending or terminating
any such Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan is in compliance with

Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the " _2010 Health Care
Law_ "), to the extent applicable, except for such noncompliance that,

Material Adverse Effect. The operation of each Company Benefit Plan will not
result in the incurrence of any penalty to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2010 Health Care Law,

Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than liability
for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") (which
premiums have been paid when due). The PBGC has not instituted proceedings
pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate any Company Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted
by the PBGC.

4971 of the Code; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of any such plan
equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under
such plan (whether or not vested, each as determined under the assumptions and
valuation method of the latest actuarial valuation of such plan); (iii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the

ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate.

trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans, (ii) no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of, an audit
or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any other Governmental Authority, and no such

(j) Each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code has operated in material compliance with such
sections and all applicable regulatory guidance, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

Illegal Gratuities", or similar policies, set forth in any Laws. None of the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company as of

(f) _Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer and subject
to compliance with _Section 6.02(h)_, the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (but only with respect to clause (A) of the definition)
in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer if, (i) in
response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal made after the date of
this Agreement and not withdrawn that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 6.02_, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (A) subject to compliance with _Section
6.02(h)_, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B)
the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_ in
order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 9.01(f)_ unless the Company (x) has complied with its obligations
under _Section 6.02(h)_, (y) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Amount payable pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination and (z) immediately following or

Agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to make an Adverse Recommendation Change

provided to Parent four (4) business days prior written notice (the " _Match
Right Notice_ "), advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action
(and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal or details of such
Intervening Event, as applicable), and (y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) business day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement intended by
Parent so that an Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be necessary
or to cause such Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, as applicable; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no
later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) business day of
such four (4) business day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that, after giving effect to such Proposed Changed Terms, the failure to make
the Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(f)_, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material changes in the changes, effects,
events, occurrences or facts relating to an Intervening Event, (2) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (3) material revisions to a
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes
a Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Intervening Event or Takeover
Proposal, as applicable, and shall in each case require the Company to deliver
to Parent a new Match Right Notice; provided that the time periods set forth
in this _Section 6.02(h)_ with respect to the new Match Right Notice shall be
reduced to three (3) business days.

 



 

(i) _Standstills; Confidentiality Agreements_ _._ Notwithstanding any
provision of _Section 6.02(e)_ to the contrary, the Company shall not grant
any waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar
agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior to the Offer Closing,
the Company may grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement or an
agreement containing a standstill provision if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall
provide written notice to Parent of waiver or release of any standstill by the

 



     

 

 



 

Company, including disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto and
circumstances relating thereto. Except for the waiver or release of standstill
as contemplated by this _Section 6.02(i)_, the Company shall enforce, and
shall not release or permit the release of any person from, or amend, waive,
terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination
or modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement
or provision to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights. The Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information
specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section
6.02_.

 



 

(j) _Communications With Stockholders_ _._ Nothing contained in this _Section
6.02_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if, in the good faith determination of the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Laws or (iii) making any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to _Section 14d-9(f)_ promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communications to the stockholders of the Company) in which the
Company indicates that it has not changed the Recommendation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred
to in _Section 6.02(e)_, _Section 6.02(f)_ or _Section 6.02(g)_ except, in
each case, in accordance with _Section 6.02(e)_, _Section 6.02(f)_ or
_Section 6.02(g)_, respectively.

reasonable best efforts to avoid such constraints on disclosure, including
entering into a joint defense agreement in customary form). No investigation
or access permitted, or knowledge obtained, pursuant to this _Section 7.01_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any

 



     

 

 



 

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company hereunder

warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in this Agreement.
Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement,
Parent shall, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, keep
confidential and not disclose, and shall cause its officers, employees,

require or obligate Parent HoldCo, Parent, Sub or any of their Subsidiaries to
agree to or otherwise be required to commit to, execute or consummate any such
Remedy Action or otherwise take or agree to take any other action if doing so
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (y) none of Parent Holdco,
Parent, Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to take or agree to take any action to fulfill its obligations set

action is conditioned on the occurrence of the Merger Closing. If requested
by Parent, subject to clause (y), the Company will become subject to,

its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,

other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate,
or if not possible minimize to the maximum extent possible, the effects of

retirement benefits maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employees participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under
any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical or
other similar benefits), to the extent past service was recognized for such
Company Employees under the comparable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
7.04_ shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result in
(i) duplication of benefits or (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under
a defined benefit pension plan.

 



 

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Company
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the

applicable to the Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) under any
welfare benefit plans in which Company Employees participate following the
Effective Time, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Company
Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) with any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change.

contained in this _Section 7.04_ are included for the sole benefit of the
Parties, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i)
shall create any Third Party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other
person, including any employees or former employees of the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the Company, any Company Employee,

Parent or any of its Affiliates or to employment or continued employment or to
a particular term or condition of employment with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, or (iii)
shall limit the right of Parent or its Subsidiaries to (A) amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time or (B) terminate the employment or service of any
employee or other service-provider following the Effective Time at any time
and for any or no reason.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 7.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase a "tail" or "runoff" directors and officers liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy and each person who
becomes covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policy prior to the consummation of the Merger on terms with respect to
coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement for the six (6) year period following
the Merger Closing and at a price not to exceed 250% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this
Agreement, which the Company represents and warrants has been disclosed to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Current Premium_ "). If the
Company or Parent obtains prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with this _Section 7.05(a)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to purchase
such "tail" or "runoff" policy prior to the Merger Closing, then either (i)
Parent may purchase such "tail" or "runoff" policy on behalf of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation or (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain a directors and officers
liability insurance policy in respect of acts or ommisions occuring prior to
the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time; _provided further_ , that in satisfying its obligation
under this _Section 7.05(a)(ii)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the
Current Premium and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in Parent or the
Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in
effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") made available to Parent; and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
charter or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. From the
Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, and Parent shall cause the charter and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to

designee) Parents and Subs costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and

exclusive remedy of Parent and Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, equity holders, managers, members or Affiliates and none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or

arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) subject
to the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 9.04_ and to the extent
permitted by Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the Party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 



 

(g) References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless

_Section 4.21 Section 4.22_, _Section 4.23_, _Section 4.24_ and _Section
4.25_, which matters shall only be disclosed by specific disclosure in the
respective corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Letter) to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is
relevant to such other Section or subsection. No disclosure in the Company
Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract
or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach
or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

(i) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 



 

(k) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Sub to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on

Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for specific
performance to be an available remedy for breaches of this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.01_, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in _Section 11.08_, without proof of actual damages, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 11.10_ are an integral part of the Merger, the
Offer and the other transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 11.10_, and each Party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Non-Recourse_. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and Representatives, that all proceedings, claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or any other
agreement referenced herein (other than the Support Agreement) or the
transactions contemplated hereunder, (B) the negotiation, execution or
performance this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein (other
than the Support Agreement) (including any representation or warranty made in,
in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or such other
agreement (other than the Support Agreement)), (C) any breach or violation of
this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein (other than the
Support Agreement) and (D) any failure of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or any other agreement referenced herein (other than the Support
Agreement) to be consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are
those solely of) the persons that are expressly identified herein as the
Parties to this Agreement and, in accordance with, and subject to the

 



     

 

 



 

terms and conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or
any other agreement referenced herein or otherwise to the contrary, each Party
covenants, agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its respective
Affiliates and Representatives, that no recourse under this Agreement or any
other agreement referenced herein (other than the Support Agreement) or in
connection with any transactions contemplated hereby shall be sought or had
against any other person and no other person shall have any liabilities or
obligations (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise,
or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any
other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) for any claims,
causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in
connection with or related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses
(A) through (D), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be
incurred by any of the aforementioned, as such, arising under, out of, in
connection with or related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses
(A) through (D), in each case, except for claims that any Party may assert
against another Party solely in accordance with, and pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 11.11_, nothing in this _Section 11.11_ shall in any way limit
Parents or Subs rights under the Support Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Guarantee_.

 



 

(a) Parent Holdco irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the due and
punctual performance of the obligations of Parent, Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and their permitted assigns hereunder (the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ ") subject to the conditions hereunder. If, for any reason
whatsoever, Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their permitted
assigns shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform
the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent Holdco will forthwith pay or perform, or
cause to be paid or performed, the Guaranteed Obligations. Parent Holdco
hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing objections
with a court, any right to require proceeding first against Parent, Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any such permitted assign, any right to require the
prior disposition of the assets of Parent, Sub or any such permitted assign to
meet their respective obligations, notice, protest and all demands whatsoever.
This is a guarantee of payment and performance and not collectability.

 



 

(b) Parent Holdco is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (to
the extent applicable) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Parent Holdco has all requisite corporate power and authority
and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
approved, executed and delivered by Parent Holdco and is a valid and binding
agreement of Parent Holdco, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors
rights generally or by principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Parent Holdco owns directly
one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Parent.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Parent Holdco shall not transfer or assign, in whole or in part, any of
its obligations under this _Section 11.12_.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as none of the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_ _._ This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered
by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable
document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.

to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after
the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if: (a) there shall have not been
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Affiliates, would
represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares as of the expiration
of the Offer (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); (b) the waiting period
applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act (or any extension
thereof) shall have neither expired nor terminated; or (c) any of the
following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as of the
expiration of the Offer:

 



 

(i) there shall be any Restraint in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing
or prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or
the Offer;

 



 

(ii) the consummation of the Offer is unlawful under any Non-U.S. Merger
Control Law;

 



 

(iii) (A) the representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section
4.07(a)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement, (B) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Sections 4.04_ and _4.19_ and the first sentence of _Section 4.10(a)_ shall
not be true and correct in all material respects as of the consummation of the
Offer, as if made at such time, except to the extent such representation or
warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case on and as of such
specific date), (C) the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in _Section 4.03_ shall not be true and correct except for _de minimis_
inaccuracies as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time,
except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to
a specific date (in which case on and as of such specific date), and (D) each
of the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the consummation of the Offer,
as if made at such time, except to the extent any such representation or
warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case on and as of such
specific date), other than in the case of clause (D) for such failures to be
true and correct that (alone or in the aggregate with all such other failures
of representations and warranties of the Company under this Agreement to be
true and correct) have not had a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood
that for this purpose all references to the term "Material Adverse Effect" and
other qualifications based on the word "material," set forth in any such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded);

 



     

 

 



 

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it

executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in clauses (c)(iii), (c)(iv) and (c)(v) above shall have occurred and be
continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.

 



 

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been
satisfied, Parent and Sub shall exclude for purposes of its determination
thereof shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been received.

 



 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Sub to extend, terminate or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Sub and,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC or NASDAQ, may be waived by Parent and Sub in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other
than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or Sub at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

 



 

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I and not defined in this Annex I
shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated

 ** _FORM OF_**

 



 

 **TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT**

 



 

This TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March
12, 2019, is entered into by and among Smith and Nephew Consolidated, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "); Papyrus Acquisition Corp., a Maryland
corporation and an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "); and
the undersigned stockholders of Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ ") set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto (each, a "
_Stockholder_ "). All terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the record or beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock set forth opposite the Stockholders name on
_Schedule A_ (all such shares of Company Common Stock set forth on _Schedule
A_ next to the Stockholders name, together with any shares of Company Common
Stock that are hereafter issued to or that beneficial ownership of is
otherwise directly or indirectly acquired by the Stockholder prior to the
termination of this Agreement, including for the avoidance of doubt any shares
of Company Common Stock acquired by the Stockholder upon the conversion of any
securities convertible into shares of Company Common Stock after the date
hereof, being referred to herein as " _Subject Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution hereof, Parent, Sub, the Company and
Smith and Nephew plc, an English public limited liability company (" _Parent
Holdco_ ") are entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with the terms
thereof, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things,
(a) Sub will commence a tender offer to purchase all the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and, (b) subject to the occurrence of the Offer Closing,
Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the

conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, and as an inducement and consideration for Parent and Sub to enter
into the Merger Agreement, each Stockholder has agreed to enter into this
Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
AGREEMENT TO TENDER AND VOTE**

 



 

1.1 **_Agreement to Tender_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Stockholder irrevocably and
unconditionally undertakes and agrees to tender or cause to be tendered in the
Offer (and not withdraw) all of its Subject Shares pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, free and clear of all Share Liens (as
defined

 



     

 

 



 

below) except for Permitted Share Liens (as defined below). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the terms of this Agreement,
as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days after the date the Offer is commenced (or in the case of any shares of
Company Common Stock directly or indirectly acquired subsequent to such second
(2nd) Business Day, no later than the earlier of (x) two (2) Business Days
after such acquisition and (y) the expiration of the Offer), each Stockholder
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the depositary designated in the
Offer pursuant to the terms of the Offer (i) a letter of transmittal with
respect to all of such Stockholders Subject Shares complying with the terms
of the Offer, (ii) written instructions to such Stockholders broker, dealer,
commercial bank, trust company or other nominee that such Subject Shares be
tendered, including a reference to this Agreement, and requesting delivery of
an "agents message" (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
depository for the Offer may reasonably request) and (iii) all other documents
or instruments required to be delivered by other stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the terms of the Offer. Each Stockholder undertakes and agrees
that, once any of its Subject Shares are tendered, such tender is irrevocable
and unconditional and such Stockholder will not withdraw and will cause not to
be withdrawn such Subject Shares from the Offer unless and until the Merger
Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Sub, or the Merger Agreement is
validly terminated prior to the Acceptance Time in accordance with its terms,
Sub shall promptly return and shall cause the depository for the Offer to
promptly return all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered
holders of such tendered shares of Company Common Stock.

 



 

1.2 **_Voting of Subject Shares_**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes and agrees
that, during the time this Agreement is in effect, at any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and in connection with any action proposed to be taken
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, such Stockholder shall,
in each case to the fullest extent that its Subject Shares are entitled to
vote thereon: (a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause all such
Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of determining a
quorum, and (b) be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or cause to be
voted), or deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent with respect
to, all of its Subject Shares (i) in favor of any proposal recommended by the
Company Board that is intended to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) against any action or
agreement that would reasonably be expected to (A) result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of such Stockholder
contained in this Agreement, or (B) result in any of the Offer Conditions not
being satisfied on or before the Outside Date, (iii) against any change in the
Company Board, (iv) against any Takeover Proposal (or any proposal relating to
or intended to facilitate a Takeover Proposal), (v) against (x) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company (other than the Offer or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement), (y) a sale, lease, license
or transfer of a material amount of assets (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, capital stock of Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company or any
reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation of the Company or (z) any
change in the present authorized capitalization of the Company or any
amendment or other change to the

 



     

 

 



 

Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the comparable organizational documents
of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and (vi) against any other proposed action, agreement or
transaction involving the Company that would reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, materially delay, materially postpone, materially adversely
affect or prevent the consummation of the Offer or the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each Stockholder shall retain at all
times the right to vote its Subject Shares in such Stockholders sole
discretion, and without any other limitation, on any matters that are at any
time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Companys
stockholders generally.

Each Stockholder represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, to Parent
and Sub that:

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Such Stockholder has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by such Stockholder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, and compliance with the provisions of, this Agreement by such
Stockholder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of such Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered

accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
insolvency and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 



 

2.2 **_Non-Contravention_**. The execution and delivery by such Stockholder of
this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will
not, (a) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the
loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of such Shareholder under, any provision of (i) the
charter or bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of such
Stockholder, if such Stockholder is not a natural person or (ii) (x) any
Contract to which such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholder or
any of its Subject Shares are bound or (y) any Law or any Judgment, in each
case applicable to such Stockholder or by which any of its Subject Shares are
bound, or (b) result (or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or
otherwise, would result) in the creation or imposition of any Share Lien (as
defined below) of any kind on any asset of such Stockholder (other than one
created by Parent or Sub or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement), other than,
in the case of clause (a)(ii) or (b) above, any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair the ability
of such Stockholder to perform such Stockholders obligations under this
Agreement on a timely basis. No consent, approval, order, waiver or
authorization of, action or nonaction by,

 



     

 

 



 

registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental

of all such Stockholders Subject Shares and has good and marketable title to
all such Subject Shares free and clear of any Liens, proxies, voting trusts or
agreements, options or rights, understandings or arrangements inconsistent
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any other
encumbrances or restrictions whatsoever on title, transfer or exercise of any
rights in respect of such Subject Shares (collectively, " _Share Liens_ "),
except for any such Share Liens that may be imposed pursuant to (i) this
Agreement and (ii) any applicable restrictions on transfer under the
Securities Act or any state securities Law (collectively, " _Permitted Share

any rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock.

Stockholders execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

 



 

2.6 **_Absence of Litigation_**. There is no Litigation pending or, to the
knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened against such Stockholder or any of
such Stockholders properties or assets (including such Stockholders Subject
Shares) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to prevent, delay or impair the consummation by such Stockholder of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impair such
Stockholders ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. There
is no Judgment outstanding against Parent or Sub that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair the
consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise impair such Stockholders ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

2.7 **_Brokers_**. Neither such Stockholder nor any of its employees, officers
or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial or similar advisor
or incurred any liability for any financial advisors or brokers fees,

 **ARTICLE III** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB**

 



 

Parent and Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Stockholders
that:

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization.

 



 

3.2 **_Authority for this Agreement_**. Each of Parent and Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, and compliance with the
provisions of, this Agreement, by Parent and Sub have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Sub, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each of the Stockholders, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Sub in accordance with
its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and
to general equity principles.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS**

 



 

Each Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that until the termination of
this Agreement:

 



 

4.1 **_No Transfer; No Inconsistent Arrangements_**. Except as provided under
this Agreement, such Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) create
or permit to exist any Share Liens, other than Permitted Share Liens, on any
of such Stockholders Subject Shares, (b) transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge,
pledge or otherwise dispose of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by
depositing, submitting or otherwise tendering any such Subject Shares into any
tender or exchange offer (other than the Offer)), or enter into any derivative
arrangement with respect to (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), any of such
Stockholders Subject Shares, or any right or interest therein (or consent to
any of the foregoing), (c) enter into any Contract, option or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to any Transfer of such
Stockholders Subject Shares or any interest therein, (d) grant or permit the
grant of any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization or consent in or
with respect to any such Stockholders Subject Shares, (e) deposit or permit
the deposit of any of such Stockholders Subject Shares into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of such
Stockholders Subject Shares or (f) take or permit any other action that would
in any way prevent, delay or impair the ability of such Stockholder to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise make any representation or
warranty of such Stockholder herein untrue or incorrect. Any action taken in
violation of the foregoing sentence shall be null and void _ab_

 



     

 

 



 

 _initio. _If any involuntary Transfer of any of such Stockholders Subject
Shares shall occur (including a sale by such Stockholders trustee in any
bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any creditors or court sale), the

contemplated thereby without the prior written consent of Parent, except as

disclosure will be provided to Parent). Such Stockholder (i) consents to and
authorizes the publication and disclosure by Parent or Sub of such
Stockholders identity and holdings of Subject Shares, the nature of such

required to be disclosed by applicable Law in any press release, the Offer
Documents (in each case, including all schedules and documents filed with the
SEC) or any other disclosure document in connection with the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger agreement (provided that
notice of any such disclosure will be provided to such Stockholder to the
extent reasonably practicable), (ii) agrees to promptly give to Parent, Sub
and the Company any information they may reasonably require for the
preparation of any such disclosure documents and (iii) agrees to promptly
notify Parent of any required corrections with respect to any information
supplied by such Stockholder specifically for use in any such disclosure
document, if and to the extent that any such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Sub each agrees to
promptly give to such Stockholder any information regarding Parent or Sub, as
applicable, that such Stockholder reasonably requires for the preparation of
any documents that such Stockholder is required to file with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

split or stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), or any change in the shares of Company
Common Stock by reason of a stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
similar change with respect to Company Common Stock, the term "Subject Shares"
shall be deemed to refer to and include such shares as well as all such stock
dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or
all of such shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in the
transaction.

agrees not to, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, commence or participate
in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class
action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent,
Sub, the Company, the directors or officers of Parent, Sub, the Company or any

claim with respect to SEC disclosure (or other disclosure to the Companys
stockholders) in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.5 **_No Solicitation_**. Such Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees and
Representatives not to, and shall not publicly announce any intention to,

to a Takeover Proposal.

 



 

4.6 **_Notice of Certain Events_**. Such Stockholder shall notify Parent of
any development occurring after the date hereof that causes, or that would
reasonably be expected to cause, any breach of any of the representations and
warranties of such Stockholder set forth in Article II. Such Stockholder shall

5.2 **_Amendment; Waiver_**. This Agreement may not be amended except by an

solely in such Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of the Company, and not

may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to each other party hereto.

 



 

6.6 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement, together with Schedule A, and the

or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by

immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns

 



 

6.9 **_Governing Law_**. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
MARYLAND ARE MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER (INCLUDING THE EXERCISE OF
THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE COMPANY BOARD), IN WHICH CASE MARYLAND LAW SHALL
GOVERN, THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN
TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS
OF LAWS THEREOF.

 



 

6.10 **_Jurisdiction; Service of Process._**

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the United
States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware
for the purpose of any Litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating
to arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes and agrees that all
claims in respect to such action or proceeding shall be brought in, and may be
heard and determined, exclusively in such state or federal courts. Each of the
Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue in, and any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any

 



     

 

 



 

action or proceeding so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such party at the
addresses set forth (i) in the case of Parent or Sub, to the address or email
address set forth in Section 11.03 of the Merger Agreement and (ii) in the
case of the Stockholder, to the Stockholders address or email address set
forth on such Stockholders signature page hereto. Nothing in this _Section
6.10(b)_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

6.11 **_Waiver of Jury Trial_**. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



 

6.12 **_Specific Enforcement_**. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for specific
performance to be an available remedy for breaches of this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 5.1, each party to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in Section 6.10, without proof of actual damages, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. Each party to this Agreement further acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this Section 6.12 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

 



     

 

 



 

that, without these agreements, none of the parties to this Agreement would
have entered into this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement further agrees
that no other party to this Agreement or any other person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 6.12, and
each Party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

6.13 **_Severability_**. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as none of the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any
manner adverse to any party to this Agreement. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to
attempt to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in a mutually acceptable manner.

 



 

6.14 **_Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_**. This Agreement
may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered
by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable
document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.

Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") may reclassify any
unissued shares of Common Stock from time to time into one or more classes or
series of stock. If shares of one class or series of stock are classified or
reclassified into shares of another class or series of stock pursuant to this
Article SEVENTH, the number of authorized shares of the former class or series

or series shall be automatically increased, in each case by the number of

"). The names of each of the directors who shall serve until the first annual
meeting of stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualifies
are:

restrictions or limitations, if any, as may be set forth in the MGCL, the
Charter or the Bylaws.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of law requiring any action to be taken or
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to cast a
greater number of votes, any such action shall be effective and valid if
declared advisable by the Board of Directors and taken or approved by the
affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

 



 

(d) The determination as to any of the following matters, made by or pursuant
to the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be final and conclusive and
shall be binding upon the Corporation and every holder of shares of its stock:
the amount of the net income of the Corporation for any period and the amount
of assets at any time legally available for the payment of dividends,
acquisition of its stock or the payment of other distributions on its stock;
the amount of paid-in surplus, net assets, other surplus, cash flow, funds
from operations, adjusted funds from operations, net profit, net assets in
excess of capital, undivided profits or excess of profits over losses on sales
of assets; the amount, purpose, time of creation, increase or decrease,
alteration or cancellation of any reserves or charges and the propriety
thereof (whether or not any obligation or liability for which such reserves or
charges shall have been created shall have been set aside, paid or
discharged); any interpretation or resolution of any ambiguity with respect to
any provision of the Charter (including any of the terms, preferences,
conversion or other rights, voting powers or rights, restrictions, limitations
as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions
of redemption of any shares of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation) or of the Bylaws; the number or value of shares of stock of

 



     

 

 



 

any class or series of the Corporation; the fair value, or any sale, bid or
asked price to be applied in determining the fair value, of any asset owned or
held by the Corporation or of any shares of stock of the Corporation; any
matter relating to the acquisition, holding and disposition of any assets by
the Corporation; the compensation of directors, officers, employees or agents
of the Corporation; or any other matter relating to the business and affairs
of the Corporation or required or permitted by applicable law, the Charter or
Bylaws or otherwise to be determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

(e) Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders
of Common Stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may be
taken without a meeting by consent, in writing or by electronic transmission,
in any manner and by any vote permitted by the MGCL and set forth in the
Bylaws.

 



 

(f) The Corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent permitted by
Maryland law in effect from time to time, to obligate itself to indemnify, and
to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a
proceeding to, (a) any individual who is a present or former director or
officer of the Corporation and who is or was made a party to, or witness in,
or is threatened to be made a party to, the proceeding by reason of his or her
service in that capacity or (b) any individual who, while a director or
officer of the Corporation and at the request of the Corporation, serves or
has served as a director, officer, partner, manager, managing member,
employee, agent or trustee of another corporation, real estate investment
trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or any other enterprise and who is made a party to, or witness
in, or is threatened to be made a party to, the proceeding by reason of his or
her service in that capacity from and against any claim or liability to which
such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his
or her service in such capacity. The Corporation shall have the power, with
the approval of the Board of Directors, to provide such indemnification and
advance of expenses to a person who served a predecessor of the Corporation in
any of the capacities described in (a) or (b) above and to any employee or
agent of the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation. To the fullest
extent permitted by Maryland law, the indemnification provided herein shall
include expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement and any such expenses may be paid or reimbursed by
the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of any such action, suit
or proceeding and without requiring a preliminary determination of the
ultimate entitlement to indemnification. Neither the amendment nor repeal of
this paragraph (f), nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of
the Charter or Bylaws inconsistent with this paragraph (f), shall apply to or
affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding sentences with
respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to any such
amendment, repeal or adoption.

 



 

 _TENTH_ : Except as may be provided by a contract approved by the Board of
Directors, no holder of shares of stock of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any additional
shares of stock of the Corporation or any other security of the Corporation
which it may issue or sell. Holders of shares of stock shall not be entitled
to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided for under Title 3,
Subtitle 2 of the MGCL or any successor statute unless the Board of Directors,
upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, shall
determine that such rights apply,

 



     

 

 



 

with respect to all or any classes or series of stock, to one or more
transactions occurring after the date of such determination in connection with
which holders of such shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise such
rights.

 



 

 _ELEVENTH_ : To the maximum extent that Maryland law in effect from time to
time permits limitation of the liability of directors and officers of a
corporation, no present or former director or officer of the Corporation shall
be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for money damages. Neither
the amendment nor repeal of this Article ELEVENTH, nor the adoption or
amendment of any other provision of the Charter or Bylaws inconsistent with
this Article ELEVENTH, shall apply to or affect in any respect the
applicability of the preceding sentence with respect to any act or failure to
act which occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.
