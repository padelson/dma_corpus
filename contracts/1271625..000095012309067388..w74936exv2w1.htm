fees and expenses incurred by it, and the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Sellers Representative. As
used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Final Closing Statement_ " means (x)
the Draft Closing Statement, as prepared by Buyer and, if applicable, as
subsequently adjusted to reflect any subsequent written agreement between
Buyer and Sellers Representative with respect thereto, or if submitted to
the Accounting Firm, or (y) the Final Closing Statement issued by
the Accounting Firm reflecting the agreements reached between Buyer and
Sellers Representative and the decisions of the Accounting Firm with respect
to items in dispute between Buyer and the Sellers Representative, and (ii) "
_Final Closing Working Capital_ " means the Closing Working Capital
determined from the Final Closing Statement. 

  

 (g) _ _The Post-Closing Adjustment Payments__. 

   

 (i) If the Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment is positive (a " _Positive Adjustment Amount_ "), then Buyer shall, within 5 Business Days of the Final Settlement Date, deliver to the Sellers Representative, for the benefit of each Seller based upon its Pro-Rata Share, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account designated by the Seller Representative, the Positive Adjustment Amount _plus_  interest on such amount at the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the date such payment is made pursuant to this _Section 2(g)(i)_ (calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed between the Closing Date and such payment date). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) If the Final Working Capital Adjustment is negative (a " _Negative Adjustment Amount_ "), then the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall within 5 Business Days of the Final Settlement Date, execute and deliver a Direction Letter (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) to the Escrow Agent releasing to Buyer (or its designee, which may be Target), from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the Negative Adjustment Amount _plus_  interest on such excess amount at the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the date such payment is made pursuant to this _Section 2(g)(ii)_ (calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed between the Closing Date and such payment date). If, at the time of release of funds by the Escrow Agent, the amount held by the Escrow Agent is insufficient to pay to the Buyer the full Negative Adjustment Amount, plus interest as calculated above, then within 3 Business Days of written demand therefore, the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay to Buyer (or its designee, which may be Target) an amount equal to the difference between (A) the Negative Adjustment Amount, plus interest as calculated above _minus_ (B) the amount then held in escrow by the Escrow Agent. 

   

 (iii) For Tax purposes, all payments under this _Section 2(g)_ shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

   

 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the determination of the Final Working Capital Adjustment and the resulting payment of a Positive Adjustment Amount or a Negative Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, is only meant to measure the extent to which the Final Closing Working Capital of Target and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date differs from the Targeted Closing Working Capital using consistent accounting principles, assumptions and interpretations. The determination of the Final Working Capital Adjustment and the resulting payment of a Positive Adjustment Amount or a Negative Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, is not intended to be used to adjust for (i) errors or omissions in the Sellers determination of the Final Closing Working Capital that are consistent with the accounting principles, assumptions and interpretations reflected in the Most Recent Annual Financial Statements, or (ii) any inconsistencies between the Sellers determination of the Final Closing Working Capital (to the extent consistent with the accounting principles, assumptions and interpretations reflected in the Most Recent Annual Financial Statements), on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other hand, for which the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 8(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy. 

  

 (h) _ _Indebtedness__. Target and Sellers Representative shall deliver to Buyer, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a certificate duly executed by the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Executive Officer of Target attaching a statement setting forth the amount of Indebtedness which will be outstanding as of the Closing Date (the " _Indebtedness Statement_ "), together with pay-off letters, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, addressed to Target and/or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be (each a " _Debt Payoff Letter_ "), duly executed by the holder (or agent of a holder) of any such Indebtedness (each Person being entitled to payment with respect to such Indebtedness being, a " _Debt Payoff Recipient_ ") containing wire transfer instructions and confirming that, upon receipt of the amount set forth in such Debt Payoff Letter, (i) all Liens on any assets of Target or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed released and forever discharged, and (ii) neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries shall 

   ##### 

  

    

have any further obligation to, and shall be released from any further
obligation to pay, any Debt Payoff Recipient any amounts with respect to such
Indebtedness. 

  

 (i) _ _Target Expenses__. Target and the Sellers Representative shall deliver to Buyer, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a certificate duly executed by the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Executive Officer of Target attaching a statement (the " _Expense Statement_ ") setting forth the amount of all of the unpaid fees, costs and expenses incurred or that may be incurred by the Sellers Representative, Target or any Subsidiary of Target, or by any Seller or any other Person either on behalf of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or which is reimbursable by Target or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with or otherwise related to the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the consummation thereof, or any alternative transactions investigated or considered before the date hereof in lieu of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Target Expenses_ "), including: (i) the fees and disbursements of outside counsel; (ii) the fees and expenses of any other agents, accountants, advisors (including financial advisors or investment bankers), consultants and experts; (iii) any unpaid compensation (other than the Change of Control Payments and the Phantom Equity Payments) which is or may, prior to the Closing Date, be awarded to employees, officers, directors or managers which is payable, in whole or in part, as a result of the Closing (collectively, " _Transaction Bonuses_ "); (iv) Taxes, if any, payable by the Target with respect to the Phantom Equity Payments, the Change of Control Payments or any Transaction Bonuses, but excluding the payment of the recipients portion of any such Taxes which is required to be withheld under applicable Law (the " _Target Withholding Taxes_ "); (v) travel (including related food and lodging) expenses; (vi) fees and expenses charged by any provider of electronic data room or similar services; (vii) fees and expenses charged by database search companies (including those providing Lien and similar searches of public records); (viii) any management fees or expenses or other amounts of any kind owed by Target or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Management Consulting Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2006, between Southfield Capital Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and DFS, and (ix) the expenses of the Sellers Representative incurred in such capacity; provided, however, that in no event shall Target Expenses include any fees or expenses incurred by Sellers or Target or its Subsidiaries solely with respect to, and that are payable to Crowe Horwath LLP or to any other Person solely in connection with, the Financing. The Expense Statement shall be accompanied by letters, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, addressed to Target and executed by each prospective recipient of Target Expenses (the " _Expense Recipients_ ") setting forth the amount of Target Expenses due and payable to such Expense Recipient, together with the wire transfer instructions which may be used to make the payments described therein, and confirming that, upon receipt of the amount set forth in such letter (each an " _Expense Payoff Letter_ "), neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further obligation to, and shall be released from any further obligation to pay, the Expense Recipient for, any Target Expenses. 

  

 (j) _ _Restricted Cash__. No later than five (5) Business Days after March 15, 2011, Target shall deliver to Sellers Representative, for the benefit of each Seller based on each Sellers Pro-Rata Share, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account designated by Sellers Representative, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of Restricted Cash as of the close of business on March 15, 2011.

 Section 6\. __Post-Closing Covenants__. The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing. 

  

 (a) _ _General__. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section 8_). 

  

 (b) _ _Litigation Support__. In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or defending against any Legal Proceeding in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, or (ii) any fact, situation, 

   ##### 

  

    

circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,

Date involving Target and its Subsidiaries, each of the other Parties

expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or
defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section 8_,
in which event the provisions of  _Section 8_ shall control). 

  

 (c) _ _Tax Matters__  

   

 (i) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Sellers Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns with respect to the Target and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "). Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all other Tax Returns with respect Target and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date (a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns with respect to Target and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and end after the Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Sellers shall pay to Buyer, no later than five (5) Business Days after any demand by Buyer, with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Returns an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (as determined pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii) hereof). In the case of any Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall permit the Sellers Representative to review and comment on such Tax Return prior to filing and shall give due regard to any such comments. Other than Tax Returns with respect to Straddle Periods that Buyer is obligated to prepare pursuant to this section, neither Buyer nor Target nor its Subsidiaries shall file any Tax Return or amended Tax Return with respect to Target or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(c)(i), if Buyer is notified in writing by a Governmental Entity that Target or any of its Subsidiaries is required to file a Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that Sellers Representative did not file or cause to be filed, Buyer may file such Tax Return any time following the expiration of the five (5) Business Day period following written notice to Sellers Representative of Buyers intention to file such Tax Return. 

   

 (ii) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. 

   

 (A) If any of Target or its Subsidiaries is permitted but not required under applicable state, local, or foreign income Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the Parties shall treat that day as the last day of a taxable period for Target or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (B) In the case of Taxes arising in a Straddle Period of Target or its Subsidiaries, except as provided in _Section 6(c)(iv)_, the allocation of such Taxes 

   ##### 

  

   

between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period shall
be made on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section
6(c)(ii)(B)_, any Tax resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is attributable to the Pre-Closing Period. 

   

 (C) In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any other Taxes be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the prior practice of Target or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (iii) _Transfer Taxes_. Any real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, transfer tax, or other similar Tax (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) imposed on Target or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Seller and Buyer. The Sellers agree to cooperate with Buyer in the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns. If required by applicable law, the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. 

   

 (iv) _Cooperation_. Sellers, Target and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer and the Sellers recognize that the Sellers may need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held by Target to the extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause Target, their Affiliates and successors to (i) retain and maintain such records and information for three years and (ii) allow the Sellers to inspect, review and make copies of such records and information as the Sellers or agent and representative of a Seller may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. 

   

 (v) _Refunds and Credits_. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of Target plus any interest received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including refunds or credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date), except to the extent such refunds are attributable to 

   ##### 

  

   

tax attributes that are generated after the Closing Date, shall be for the
account of Sellers and shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers Representative
within ten (10) days after Buyer or Target or any of its Subsidiaries
receives such refund or after the relevant Tax Return is filed in which a
credit is applied against Buyers, Targets or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their successors liability for Taxes. The amount due to Sellers under
this paragraph shall be reduced, but not below zero, by any expenses incurred
by Buyer, Target or Subsidiary in obtaining the refund or in order to
benefit from the credit. Buyer shall not be under any obligation to prosecute
any refund claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

  

 (d) _ _Non-Competition and Confidentiality__. 

   

 (i) _Non-Competition_. Each of the Sellers understands that Buyer shall be entitled to protect and preserve the going concern value of the business of Target and its Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by Law and that Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of this _Section 6(d)(i)_ and, therefore, for a period from the Closing Date until two (2) years after such time (the " _Restricted Period_ "), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, (A) engage in activities or businesses, or establish any new businesses (in each case whether as an owner, officer, director, manager, partner, employee, independent contractor, consultant or otherwise), that provides automobile or truck financing loans, or otherwise assists in the provision of or arranges for automobile or truck financing loans, primarily to United States military personnel (whether in the United States or elsewhere), or otherwise competes with the business conducted by the Target as of the Closing Date or as contemplated to be conducted by Target or its Subsidiaries as set forth in the Confidential Memorandum, or (B) influence or attempt to influence any supplier, licensor, licensee, strategic partner, distributor or customer to terminate or modify any Contract (or any course of dealing thereunder) with Target or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Competitive Activities_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , the foregoing provisions shall not prohibit (x) any Seller from owning up to 2% of the outstanding voting securities of a publicly-traded company so long as neither such Seller, nor any of its Affiliates, seeks to influence or control, or is otherwise involved as an officer, director, manager or employee of, or independent contractor or consultant to, such publicly-traded company, (y) ownership of one or more automobile dealers or dealerships by any Seller, or (z) Nelson from performing services as an employee of Target or its Affiliates after the Closing Date on behalf of Target and its Affiliates which could constitute Competitive Activities. 

   

 (ii) _Non-Solicitation_. During the Restricted Period, no Seller shall, directly or indirectly, (A) influence or attempt to influence any employee, consultant, independent contractor to terminate or modify any Contract (or any course of dealing thereunder) with Target or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, or (B) hire any employee, consultant, independent contractor of Target of any of its Subsidiaries who was employed for or engaged by, Target or any of its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement or at any time during the Restricted Period or the one (1) year period prior to the date of this Agreement, provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit Nelson from performing services as an employee of Target or its Affiliates after the Closing Date on 

   ##### 

  

   

behalf of Target and its Affiliates which could constitute a prohibited
activity under this  _Section 6(d)(ii)_. 

   

 (iii) _Confidentiality_. Each Seller recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary and Confidential Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of the business of Target and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit Nelson from performing services as an employee of Target or its Affiliates after the Closing Date on behalf of Target and its Affiliates which could constitute a prohibited activity under this _Section 6(d)(iii)_. As a result, such Seller will not, without the prior written consent of Target, divulge to any third party for any reason or use for his own benefit, any Proprietary and Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller is compelled to disclose Proprietary and Confidential Information by court order or other legal process, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall promptly so notify Target so that it may seek a protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment of such Proprietary and Confidential Information shall be afforded, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Target and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates in connection therewith. If Seller is so obligated by court order or other legal process to disclose Proprietary and Confidential Information, Seller will disclose only the minimum amount of such Proprietary and Confidential Information as is necessary for Seller to comply with such court order or other legal process. 

   

 (iv) _Judicial Modification; Enforceability_. If any court determines that any of the restrictive covenants set forth in _Section 6(e)_ (collectively, the " _Restrictive Covenants_ ") is unenforceable because of the duration or geographical scope of such provision, such court shall have the power to modify such provision and, in its modified form, such provision shall then be enforceable. If any court holds any of the Restrictive Covenants unenforceable by reason of their breadth or scope or otherwise, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such determination not bar or in any way affect the right of Target and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates to the relief provided in this _Section 6(e)(iv)_ and _Section 11(o)_ in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographic scope of such Restrictive Covenants.

 (iv) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third-Party Claim as provided in _Section 8(d)(iii)_, if an Indemnifying Party is not permitted pursuant to this Agreement to assume the defense of a Third-party Claim or if an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim but fails to actively defend such claim in good faith, then the Indemnified Party may undertake and control the defense of any such Third-Party Claim in any manner, with counsel and other advisors and experts that it deems reasonable and appropriate, and the cost and expenses of any the investigation or defense of any such Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party within 30 days following receipt of customary invoices.

Within 15 days after the giving of any Dispute Notice, a representative of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the matter.

the execution of this Agreement; provided, however, Buyer and the
Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) the of existence of actual knowledge
of a misstatement or breach shall not be deemed to be conclusive or
dispositive that the Sellers are not required to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in any such claim for indemnification by a
Buyer Indemnified Party, and (ii) any Seller asserting that actual knowledge
on the part of a Buyer Indemnified Party should be deemed to be a defense
against the obligation of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for the applicable claim shall have the burden of proving the
existence of such actual knowledge on the part of a Buyer Knowledge Party.

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims,
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Parties notice in the manner herein set forth. 

   

 (h) _ _Governing Law__ _._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. Each Party further agrees that any litigation under this Agreement may be brought by any Party hereto in New York County in the State of New York notwithstanding that one or more of the Parties may not be a resident of or domiciled in the State of New York when the litigation is commenced and/or cannot be served process within the State of New York. In addition, each Party irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the courts in New York County, New York (whether federal or state) for all disputes with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (i) _ _Amendments and Waivers__. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer and Sellers Representative. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. 

  

 (j) _ _Severability__. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 (k) _ _Expenses__. Each Seller, Buyer, and Target will bear his, her, or its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (l) _ _Construction__. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (m) _ _Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules__. The Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. 

  

 (n) _ _Disclosure Schedule__. The Parties agree as follows: (i) the Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in sections corresponding to the lettered and numbered sections contained in _Section 4_; (ii) where appropriate any disclosure in any section or subsection in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in each other section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule if and to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of the Disclosure Schedule that the particular disclosure reasonably relates to such other section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule; (iii) disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute an expression of a view that such matter is material or is required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) to the extent that any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement is qualified by the materiality of the matter(s) to which the representation or warranty relates, the inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule does not constitute a determination by Sellers that any such matter is material; and (iv) the disclosure of any information concerning a matter in the Disclosure Schedule does not imply that any other, undisclosed matter that has a greater significance or value is material. 

  

 (o) _ _Specific Performance, Injunctive Relief and Other Equitable Remedies__. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a Partys breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the nonbreaching Party and that the nonbreaching Party will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, subject to applicable law, the obligations of each of Sellers and Buyer under this Agreement, including Sellers obligation to sell the Target Interests to Buyer, Buyers obligation to purchase the Target Interests from Sellers and the provisions of  _Sections 6(d)_ and _(e)_ shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance or other equitable remedies issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 (p) _ _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY__. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
