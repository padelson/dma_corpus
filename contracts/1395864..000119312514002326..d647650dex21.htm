ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(as in effect from time to time, the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its corporate existence
under the DGCL as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place,
date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ ".

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file the certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "),
executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required
by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or at such later time as is agreed between the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (such date and time is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as
provided under the DGCL.

 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended so as to read in its
entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ , until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law, in
each case consistent with the obligations set forth in  _Section 5.9_.

(b) The Company and the Surviving Corporation will take all necessary action
such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
will be amended so as to read in their entirety in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit I_ , until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the
obligations set forth in _Section 5.9_.

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a)  _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to _Section 2.1(d)_ and _Section
2.1(f)_, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each such share, a " _Share_ ", and all such shares
collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other than any Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares, will be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into
the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration
equal to (i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration, (ii) the Per Share
Closing Note Consideration and (iii) the Per Share Closing
Share Consideration, each as reasonably determined by the Companys Board of
Directors based on the Waterfall Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (the
" _Waterfall_

 



3   _Schedule_ "). In the event that any holder of In-the-Money Options does
not deliver an Optionholder Acknowledgement, the Companys Board of Directors
will use its reasonable discretion in allocating the Aggregate Closing Merger
Consideration among the holders of Shares, Company RSUs and In-the-Money
Options based on the methodologies set forth on the Waterfall Schedule in
order to reflect any holder of In-the-Money Options not delivering an
Optionholder Acknowledgement.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly
or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time or held directly or indirectly by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
for such cancellation and retirement.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, all
of the capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates, if any, representing the
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall have the aggregate
amount of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder in respect of any
Share Consideration equitably adjusted (by rounding up or down to the
nearest whole share, as appropriate) such that the holders of Shares receive
only whole shares of Parent Common Stock, with no adjustment in the aggregate
amount of Share Consideration.

 

(e) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) and that are held by holders
of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
or consented thereto in writing (and who have certified thereto to the
Company) and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto
in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL, and
who have not withdrawn their request for appraisal rights (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and holders of such Dissenting Shares
will be entitled instead to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless
and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses
its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and 

 



4  had become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, without any interest
thereon, the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the
consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and shall promptly pay
such consideration to the Paying Agent for payment to the holders thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous
sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) the opportunity to control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer
to settle or compromise, or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

 

(f) _Minimum Denomination of Notes_. No denomination of Verso First Lien Notes
less than $2,000 with fully integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000
shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares
otherwise entitled to a lower amount of Verso First Lien Notes shall have the
aggregate amount of such Verso First Lien Notes to be issued to such holder
in respect of any Note Consideration equitably adjusted (by rounding up or
down to the nearest whole denomination or increment, as appropriate) such that
the holders of Shares receive only Verso First Lien Notes in denominations of
$2,000 with fully integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000, with no
adjustment in the aggregate amount of Note Consideration.

Section 2.2  _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent hereunder and shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit
of holders of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) (each, a " _Former Holder_ "), consideration (whether in the form of
cash, Verso First Lien Notes and/or shares of Parent Common Stock) sufficient
to pay the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration which is payable in respect
of Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (such consideration being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and immediately prior to the Closing,
the Company shall provide the Paying Agent with the stock ledger of the
Company.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) The Paying Agent shall make available at the Closing and, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, shall mail or
transmit electronically to each Former Holder, (A) a shareholder consent and
release (the " _Stockholder Release_ "), in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit K_ , (B) a cooperation agreement (the " _Cooperation Agreement_ "),
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit L_ , and (C) instructions for
obtaining the portion of the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration to which
such Former Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ less any
applicable withholding Taxes.

 



5 (ii) Upon delivery of the Stockholder Release, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the Former
Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the
Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, _plus_ any interest or other payments made
after the Closing in respect of any Verso First Lien Notes and any dividends
or other distributions paid with respect to any shares of Parent Common
Stock, in each case included in the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration,
and interest shall accrue on any Verso First Lien Notes included in the
Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms thereof.
Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, no interest will be paid or
accrued on the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration.

 

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains undistributed to the Former Holders for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand,
and any Former Holders who have not executed and delivered the documentation
required pursuant to  _Section 2.1(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of their portion of the Aggregate Closing
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ less any applicable
withholding Taxes, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Former Holder for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by Former Holders as of a date that is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent (or at Parents election, the Surviving Corporation)
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



6 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct,
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Upon payment by the Company of the Recapitalization Dividend, the Company
shall adjust each option to purchase a share of Company Common Stock (each, a
" _Company Stock Option_ ") by reducing the exercise price of each such
Company Stock Option by the amount payable in respect of one Share in
connection with the payment of the Recapitalization Dividend, as determined
by the Company in its sole discretion. Each Company Stock Option, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is an In-the-Money Option shall, as of the Effective Time,
become fully vested. At the Closing, each In-the-Money Option shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right of the holder thereof to
receive, subject to the holders execution and delivery to the Company of an
acknowledgment in the form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent
(the " _Optionholder Acknowledgement_ "): (i) an amount of cash equal to the
product of the Option Spread Value and the Total Cash Percentage (the "
_Recapitalization Option Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) an amount of Verso
First Lien Notes (valued at fair market value as determined by the Companys
Board of Directors in its sole discretion after taking into account the
trading price of the Existing Verso First Lien Notes) equal to the product of
the Option Spread Value and the Total Note Percentage (the " _Recapitalization
Option Note Consideration_ "), and (iii) a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (valued at the Parent Trading Price) equal to the product of the Option
Spread Value and the Total Share Percentage (the " _Recapitalization Option
Share Consideration_ "), in each case as reasonably determined by the
Companys Board of Directors based on the Waterfall Schedule; _provided_ that
the Recapitalization Option Cash Consideration, the Recapitalization Option
Note Consideration and the Recapitalization Option Share Consideration shall
each be reduced on a Relative Recapitalization Option Pro Rata Basis by the
Option Withholding Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a holder of In-
the-Money Options does not deliver an Optionholder Acknowledgement to the
Company, then each In-the-Money Option held by such holder shall be cancelled
and converted automatically into the right of such holder to receive (x) an
amount of cash equal to the product of the Option Spread Value and the Option
Cash Consideration Percentage (the " _Option Cash Consideration_ "), (y) an
amount of Verso First Lien Notes (valued at fair market value as determined by
the Companys Board of Directors in its sole discretion after taking into
account the trading price of the Existing Verso First Lien Notes) equal to
the product of the Option Spread Value and the Option Note Consideration
Percentage (the " _Option Note Consideration_ "), and (z) a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock (valued at Parent Trading Price) equal to the product
of the Option Spread Value and the Option Share Consideration Percentage (the
" _Option Share Consideration_ "), each as reasonably determined by the
Companys Board of Directors based on the Waterfall Schedule; _provided_ that
the Option Cash Consideration, the Option Note Consideration and the Option
Share Consideration shall each be reduced on a Relative Option Pro Rata Basis
by the Option Withholding Amount. The Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay or issue, as the case may be, to the
former holders of In-the-Money Options the

 



7  consideration described in this _Section 2.3(a)_ on or as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date through the Companys
payroll system; _provided_ that the recipients thereof shall be required, as
a condition of receiving such consideration, to execute a Stockholder Release.
All Company Stock Options that are Out-of-the-Money Options shall
automatically be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time without
payment and shall be of no further force or effect. As of the Effective Time,
all Company Stock Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Stock Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the payments, if any, specified in this _Section 2.3(a)_. The Company shall
deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option informing such
holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company Stock Options (which
notice, for the avoidance of doubt, may be included as part of the
Optionholder Acknowledgements contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_, as
determined by the Company in its sole discretion). 

(b) Each holder of restricted stock units that correspond to shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") shall be entitled to receive, in
respect of each Company RSU held by such holder, a dividend equivalent equal
to the Per Share Recapitalization Dividend in connection with the Companys
payment of the Recapitalization Dividend (the " _Dividend Equivalent_ "),
less all such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, in accordance with
the award agreement pursuant to which the Company RSU was granted (the " _RSU
Award Agreement_ "). As provided in the applicable RSU Award Agreement and
provided it has not previously been forfeited in accordance with its terms,
the Dividend Equivalent in respect of each Company RSU shall be paid in cash
to the holder thereof, less all such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law,
on the date on which the Company Common Stock underlying the Company RSU
is distributed to the holder in accordance with the applicable RSU Award
Agreement or on or promptly following the Closing Date pursuant to the
Companys payroll system if the underlying Company RSU vests pursuant to the
next sentence. Each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested. At the Closing, each Company RSU shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right of the holder thereof to
receive on or promptly following the Closing Date through the Companys
payroll system (i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration, (ii) the Per
Share Closing Note Consideration and (iii) the Per Share Closing Share
Consideration, each as reasonably determined by the Companys Board of
Directors based on the Waterfall Schedule; _provided_ that the Per Share
Closing Cash Consideration, the Per Share Closing Note Consideration, and the
Per Share Closing Share Consideration payable in respect of each Company RSU
shall each be reduced on a Relative RSU Pro Rata Basis by the RSU Withholding
Amount and _provided further_ that the recipients thereof shall be required,
as a condition of receiving such consideration, to execute a Stockholder
Release. As of the Effective Time, all Company RSUs shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the payments specified in this _Section 2.3(b)_ and any
unpaid portion of the Dividend Equivalent in respect of each Company RSU held
by the holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, which unpaid portion
(if any) shall become payable to the holder as of the Effective Time. The
Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Company RSU informing
such holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company RSUs (which notice,
for the

 



8  avoidance of doubt, may be included as part of the Optionholder
Acknowledgements contemplated by _Section 2.3(a)_, as determined by the
Company in its sole discretion). In the event that the immediate payment of
the consideration contemplated above in respect of the Company RSUs would
cause an impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code, such
consideration shall become vested at the Effective Time and will be paid at
the earliest time such payment would not cause an impermissible acceleration
event under Section 409A.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any administering committee) shall adopt such resolutions
that are necessary for the treatment of the Company Stock Options and Company
RSUs pursuant to this  _Section 2.3_.

(d) The conversions and payments in respect of the Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs pursuant to this  _Section 2.3_ are intended to comply with or
be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be
interpreted in such a manner. To the extent that any conversions or payments
to made under this  _Section 2.3_ could cause the application of an
accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments
shall be deferred if deferral will make such payments compliant under Section
409A, or such payments shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a
manner, determined by the Company in its sole discretion, that does not cause
such an accelerated or additional tax.

 

Section 2.4 _Escrow_. On the Pre-Closing Funding Date, the Company shall
deposit the Equity Award Carveout Amount into an escrow account (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") to be established and maintained by the Paying Agent until
the Closing and the payment of the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration
hereunder pursuant to an escrow agreement to be mutually and reasonably
agreed to by the Company and Parent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), and entered
into on the Pre-Closing Funding Date by the Company, Parent and the Paying
Agent. In addition, on the Pre-Closing Funding Date, the Company
shall deposit the aggregate amount received by the Company from the exercise
of Company Stock Options from and after the date hereof, and shall, from time
to time, deposit additional amounts received from the exercise of Company
Stock Options into the Escrow Account. A portion of the funds deposited in
the Escrow Account shall be released to the Company from time to time to pay
any Dividend Equivalent that becomes payable to a holder of a Company RSU that
vests from time to time in accordance with its terms, and the remainder of
such funds shall be released to the Company immediately prior to the Closing
for purposes of making the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_,
_Section 2.3(a)_ and  _Section 2.3(b)_.

Section 2.5 _Aggregate Consideration_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary in no event will the
aggregate consideration payable pursuant to this _Article II_ to holders of
Shares, Company RSUs and Company Stock Options be more than (or less than) (i)
cash equal to the Equity Award Carveout Amount plus any cash payments from the
exercise of Company Stock Options received by the Company between the
date hereof and Closing and less any Dividend Equivalents paid in respect of
Company RSUs between the date hereof and Closing Date (but not including any
Dividend Equivalents paid on Company RSUs that vest as of the Effective Time),
(ii) the Note Consideration and (iii) the Share Consideration.

 



9 (b) On the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, the Company
will deliver to Parent an updated Waterfall Schedule containing calculations
of (i) the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration, (ii) the Per Share Closing
Note Consideration, (iii) the Per Share Closing Share Consideration, (iv) the
aggregate dollar amount of Dividend Equivalents that will be paid at Closing,
(v) the Recapitalization Option Cash Consideration, (vi) the Recapitalization
Option Note Consideration, (vii) the Recapitalization Option Share
Consideration and, if any Optionholder does not deliver an Optionholder
Acknowledgement to the Company, (vii) the Option Cash Consideration, the
Option Note Consideration and the Option Share Consideration. The Company
shall also deliver to Parent confirmation that the aggregate amounts payable
at Closing pursuant to this _Article II_ to the holders of Shares, Company
RSUs and Company Stock Options equals the consideration referenced in _Section
2.5(a)_, and in the event the Company is unable to deliver such confirmation,
the Company shall reasonably adjust the calculations referenced in the prior
sentence in order to allow it to deliver such confirmation to Parent.

 

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Company is solely responsible
for the calculation of the consideration referred to in this  _Article II_ ,
and that Parent shall have no responsibility or liability for any such
calculation, other than to pay the amounts provided by the Company in _Section
2.5(b)_ (which shall be no greater than the aggregate
consideration referenced in _Section 2.5(a_).

all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any

schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof,

financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),

procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to

Contract with any Governmental Entity, necessary for the Company and
its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any such Company Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, in compliance with the terms and
requirements of the Company Permits, and no investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to any violation or non-compliance with a
Company Permit is pending, or the Companys knowledge, threatened, except for
any such noncompliance or investigation or review that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

include, without limitation, any Contract that provides for employment or
engagement of any Person on a full-time, part-time or consulting basis
providing for fixed and/or variable compensation in the aggregate in excess of
$200,000 per annum and any Contract providing for severance, retention, change
in control or similar payments (each such Contract, a " _Material Benefits
Contract_ ")) or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any material liability, whether current or contingent (collectively,
without regard to materiality and whether or not listed on  _Section 3.9(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). Prior to
the date hereof, the Company has provided to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of each Material Benefits Contract.

 



18 (b) The Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of
all Company Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto in each case that are in

its Subsidiaries have timely made all material contributions, distributions,

Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), breach of fiduciary duty
(as determined under ERISA), or transaction that could subject the Company or
any Subsidiary to a material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Any Company Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, or may rely upon a
favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service, as to the
qualified status of such Company Benefit Plan, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect such qualified status. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
maintains, contributes to or has any obligation or liability (whether current
or contingent) with respect to any plan, program or arrangement that provides
post-termination or retiree health or life insurance benefits to any Person,
except as required by COBRA (or any similar state Law) for which the covered
individual pays the full cost of coverage. The Company, its Subsidiaries and
their ERISA Affiliates have for the past three (3) years complied in all
material respects and are in compliance in all material respects with
the requirements of COBRA (and any similar state law). Each Material Benefits
Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the Subsidiary of
the Company which is party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, of
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect and enforceable
against the Company or the Subsidiary of the Company which is party thereto in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (i) may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally, and (ii) is
subject to the rules governing the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan (other than a multiemployer
plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of

satisfied and all contributions required under Section 302 of ERISA and

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA have
been 

 



19  timely paid; (iii) no notice of intent to terminate any Title IV Plan has

terminated; (iv) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted
proceedings to treat any Title IV Plan as terminated; (v) to the knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that may constitute
grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any Title IV Plan; (vi) no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that may result in a liability under or with
respect to Section 4062(e) or 4069 of ERISA; (vii) no reportable event (as
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and in the regulations issued thereunder) has
occurred (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA);
and (viii) no Title IV Plan is considered to be in "at risk" status under
Section 430 of the Code.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their ERISA
Affiliates maintains, contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or
has any liability under or with respect to any (i) "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), (ii) "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the
Code), or (iii) "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA),
and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has or has had any obligation or liability as a consequence of
being considered a single employer under Section 414 of the Code with any
other Person. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
ERISA Affiliates has incurred within the past six (6) years or reasonably
expects to incur, nor do any of them have any obligation to pay, any
withdrawal liability within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA. 

(f) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, consultant or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable
Law, or (ii) except as expressly provided in this Agreement, accelerate the
time of payment, funding or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation
due any such employee, consultant or officer or under any Company Benefit Plan
or otherwise.

(g) Each Company Stock Option was granted with an exercise price not less than
the fair market value of the underlying Company Common Stock on the date of
grant. No director, officer, employee or service provider of the Company or
its Affiliates is entitled to a gross-up, make-whole or indemnification
payment with respect to taxes imposed under Section 409A or Section 4999 of
the Code.

(h) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by any employee, director or other individual
service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company
Benefit Plan or otherwise, either alone or in combination with another event,
would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be
subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

 



20 (i) There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened Actions or
claims by or on behalf of any Company Benefit Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any Company Benefit Plan or with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
liability, whether actual or contingent or known or unknown, with respect to
any misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than
as an employee, which would reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no material liability by reason of an individual who
performs or performed services for the Company or its Subsidiaries in any
capacity being improperly excluded from participating in a Company Benefit
Plan. Since December 21, 2012, each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been properly classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under
applicable Law.

consistent with past practices, and (ii) there has not been a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and (b) since December 31, 2012, until the date of

pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened before any
Governmental Entity or by any private party by or against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the business, properties or
assets, or against any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with such officers, directors or employees
relationship with, or actions taken on behalf of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, that would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, or would be reasonably likely to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3.12 _Information Supplied_. None of the information provided by the
Company for inclusion in the proxy statement for the meeting of the holders
of Parent Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder

24 Section 3.15 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of all of the following owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction in the world: (i) registered trademarks and
service marks and applications for registration of the same; (ii) registered
copyrights and applications for copyright registrations; (iii) issued patents
and pending patent applications; and (iv) internet domain name registrations
(collectively, the " _Scheduled Intellectual Property_ "). The Company or one
of its Subsidiaries owns all of the Intellectual Property identified or
required to be identified in _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens and
nonexclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice).

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, either the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company owns or otherwise possesses sufficient rights to
use all Company Intellectual Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
taken all necessary actions to maintain all of the Scheduled Intellectual
Property owned by it or them, and no expiration or loss of any Scheduled
Intellectual Property is pending or reasonably foreseeable (other than (i)
pursuant to prosecution of applications in the ordinary course or (ii)
expiration of any patent at the conclusion of its statutory term). Immediately
after the Closing, all Company Intellectual Property that is material to the
conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be owned
or available for use by the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms and
conditions substantially similar to which the same was owned or used by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (including
unsolicited offers or demands to license third party Intellectual Property) by
any Person alleging infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any third party Intellectual
Property, and no such claim has been asserted against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the last three (3) years. Except as would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or
violate, and has not in the last three (3) years, infringed, misappropriated,
diluted or violated any Intellectual Property rights of any Person. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any claim of a violation or
infringement by others of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, no Person is
infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or violating, and no Person has in the
three (3) years prior to the date hereof, infringed, misappropriated, diluted,
or violated any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) The Companys and its Subsidiaries computer firmware, hardware,
databases, software (whether general or special purpose) and other
information technology infrastructure used by the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the conduct of their businesses (collectively, the " _Company IT Systems_
") are in good operating condition and repair (subject only to the provision
of usual and customary maintenance) and are sufficient for the conduct of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries respective businesses as currently conducted,
and there have been no material failures, outages or unavailability of any of
the foregoing in the last three (3) years. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place that are
reasonably sufficient to minimize and mitigate the occurrence, duration and
effect of any unavailability of the Company IT Systems.

 



25 (d) For purposes of this _Section 3.15_, the term "knowledge" shall
not require the Company to conduct, have conducted, obtain or have obtained
any non-infringement, inventorship, invalidity, freedom-to-operate or any
other opinions of counsel or any external searches regarding registered
Intellectual Property, including any ownership, validity, non-infringement or
competitive intelligence searches.

Section 3.16 _Real Property_.

 

(a) _Section 3.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
owner, street address, town or city, county, state, acreage and description
of each Owned Real Property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the
date of this Agreement (such property collectively, the " _Company Owned Real

reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (i) either the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has
marketable and insurable fee simple title to such Company Owned Real
Property, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, (ii) there
are no leases, subleases, licenses, or other rights or agreements to use or
occupy the Company Owned Real Property or a portion thereof, (iii) there are
no outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal in
favor of any other party to purchase such Company Owned Real Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the existing use of the Company Owned Real Property by the
Company in the operation of its business thereon. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any pending, and to the knowledge
of the Company there is no threatened, condemnation proceeding with respect
to any Company Owned Real Property, except proceedings which would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 

(b) _Section 3.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
lessor, street address, town or city, county, state, acreage (or square
footage for an office site), and description (for any site other than an
office site) of each Leased Real Property leased by the Company or any
Subsidiary (the " _Company Leased Real Property_ "), and a true and complete
list of all Leases (including all amendments, extensions, renewals,
guaranties and other agreements with respect thereto). The Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of each such Lease document, and
in the case of any oral Lease, a written summary of the material terms of
such Lease. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (i) each Lease under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries uses
or occupies any of the Company Leased Real Property (the " _Company Real
Property Leases_ ") is valid, binding and in full force and effect, except as
such enforceability (A) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally, and (B) is subject to the rules governing the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law, (ii) as of the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subleasing, licensing or
otherwise granting any Person the right to use or occupy a portion of any
Company Leased Real Property, and (iii) no uncured default on the part of the
Company or, if applicable, its Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the
Company, the landlord thereunder, exists under any Company Real Property
Lease, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the giving
of notice, the

 



26  passage of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default under a
Company Real Property Lease. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has a
good and valid leasehold interest, subject to the terms of the Company Real
Property Leases, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. As
of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received notice of any pending, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there is no threatened, condemnation proceeding with respect to any Company
Real Property Lease, except such proceeding which would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(c) The Company Owned Real Property identified in _Section 3.16(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Company Leased Real Property identified
in _Section 3.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule comprise all of the
material real property used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their respective businesses.

 

(d) All of the Company Owned Real Property and the Company Leased Real
Property are in material compliance with all applicable building, zoning and
other land use laws, and all insurance requirements affecting real property
(collectively, the " _Real Property Laws_ "), and the current use and
occupancy of the Company Owned Real Property and the Company Leased
Real Property do not violate any Real Property Laws in any material respects.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received notice of any material
violation of any Real Property Law.

 

Section 3.17 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors of the

of $1,000,000 in the aggregate, or make any change in its existing borrowing
or lending arrangements for or on behalf of any of such Persons;

(viii) enter into any new line of business outside of the pulp, paper and

Section 5.3 _Investigation_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford the other party and (i)
the officers, directors and employees and (ii) the accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives
(such Persons described in this clause (ii), collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") of such other party, and the Company shall afford
Parents financing sources (including the Debt Financing Sources)and their
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout
the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination
Date, to its and its Subsidiaries business, personnel, properties, Contracts,
commitments, books and records and any report, schedule or other document
filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws, and
with such additional accounting, financing, operating, environmental and other
data and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent
and the Debt Financing Sources may reasonably request, and Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as the Company may reasonably request, as the case may be;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no access or information pursuant to this
_Section 5.3_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made or deemed made by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall
be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, or if such party
determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such
party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, Order or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, or any obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party.

 

(b) The parties agree that all information provided to them or their
respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be, to the extent covered by the definition, deemed to be
"Evaluation Material", as such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 25, 2013,
as amended, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

 



45 Section 5.4 _Exclusive Dealing_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the Termination Date, if any, the Company shall not take, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers,
directors or employees to take, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives not to take, any action to solicit, encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to or enter into any agreement with any Person or facilitate, any
inquiries or submission of proposals or offers from any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and/or their respective Affiliates) concerning any
Alternative Transaction. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations by the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
Persons (other than Parent and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect
to any Alternative Transaction and request from each Person that has executed
a confidentiality agreement with the Company in connection with an
Alternative Transaction the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to such Person or its representatives and
terminate access by each such Person and its representatives to any online or
other data rooms containing any information in respect of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. In addition, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to take any
action to exempt any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) or any
action taken by any such Person from any state takeover statute or similarly
restrictive provisions of the Company Organizational Documents, or except
with respect to Parent and its Affiliates, grant any waiver or release under,
or terminate, amend or otherwise modify any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreement with respect to any equity or debt securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise take any action that would render
the provisions thereof ineffective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may respond to any unsolicited proposal regarding an Alternative Transaction
by indicating that the Company is subject to a definitive agreement regarding
a transaction and, except as provided in such definitive agreement, is unable
to provide any information related to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or
discussions concerning an Alternative Transaction for as long as such
definitive agreement remains in effect. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section 5.4_, in no event shall the Company endorse, recommend, make a
public statement or support in any manner any Alternative Transaction, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.4_, until the Effective Time or
the Termination Date, the Company (x) shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) effect any Change
of Recommendation, or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, confidentiality agreement or any other agreement
relating to or providing for any Alternative Transaction (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under _Section 5.4(c)_); and (y) shall
promptly notify Parent (but in no case later than 48 hours after receipt) of
the receipt of any proposal for any Alternative Transaction or any inquiry,
offer or request for information with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in, an Alternative Transaction, or any discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives concerning an Alternative
Transaction, indicating, in each case, the identity of the Person or group
making such Alternative Transaction proposal, inquiry, offer or request for
information and a copy of any Alternative Transaction proposal, inquiry, offer
or request made in writing and the material terms and conditions of an
Alternative

 



46  Transaction proposal, inquiry, offer or request not made in writing, and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail, on a prompt basis
(and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of the Companys or its
representatives knowledge of any such event), of any material developments or
modifications to the terms of any such Alternative Transaction proposal,
inquiry, offer or request (including copies of any documents) and the status
thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt by the Company of the Company Stockholder Approval, if
the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide proposal for an Alternative
Transaction (provided that the Company has complied in all material respects
with this _Section 5.4_), the Board of Directors of the Company may take the
following actions if it determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys nationally recognized financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
(x) based on the information then available that such Alternative Transaction
constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y)
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law: 

(i) furnish information to the third party making such proposal, if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information, such third party has entered
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company having terms at least as
restrictive in all respects on such third party as the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of a proposal for an
Alternative Transaction); _provided_ , that (i) if the third party making such
proposal for an Alternative Transaction is a competitor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Company shall not provide any competitively sensitive
non-public information to such Person in connection with any actions permitted
by this _Section 5.4_ other than in accordance with "clean team" or other
similar procedures reasonably designed to limit any materially adverse effect
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the sharing of such information
and (ii) if such third party is not a competitor of the Company,
the confidentiality agreement need not include restrictions to provide for
such procedures; and

(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such third party with respect
to the proposal for an Alternative Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours)
(x) notify Parent upon the commencement of such discussions or negotiations,
(y) disclose the identity of such third party who has made a proposal for an
Alternative Transaction and make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any such third party that was not previously made available to Parent, along
with a copy of any Alternative Transaction proposal made in writing and the
material terms and conditions of any Alternative Transaction proposal not
made in writing, and (z) thereafter keep Parent informed in reasonable detail
of any developments or modifications to the material terms of any such
Alternative Transaction proposal, inquiry, offer or request (including copies
of any documents) and the status thereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the earlier of the date the Company Stockholder Approval is
received or the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change of
Recommendation if, but only if:

 



47 (i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys nationally recognized financial
advisors and its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to effect such Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that no Change of Recommendation may be made relating to an
Alternative Transaction proposal unless the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that a proposal for an
Alternative Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal and that concurrently
with such Change of Recommendation, the Board of Directors of the Company
authorizes and approves the Company to, and the Company enters into a
definitive written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_; _provided_  
_further_ that no Change of Recommendation may be made if the Change of
Recommendation is not made to enter into a definitive written agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, unless the Change of Recommendation directly
addresses an Intervening Event;

(ii) the Company shall have given written notice (the " _Change of
Recommendation Notice_ ") to Parent at least five (5) Business Days (the "
_Notice Period_ ") prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation that the
Companys Board of Directors has resolved to effect a Change of
Recommendation and, if such Change of Recommendation relates to a Superior
Proposal, that the Board of Directors has resolved to terminate this
Agreement, enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to Superior
Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, (A)
describing in detail the reasons for such Change of Recommendation, and (B) in
the case of Change of Recommendation related to a Superior Proposal, to the
extent not previously provided to Parent, attaching a copy of all information
required to be provided by this _Section 5.4_;

(iii) during the Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (if Parent desires to negotiate) to make
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for a Change of Recommendation, and

(iv) upon the expiration of the Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the
Company, after consultation with the Companys nationally recognized financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith, after
taking into account any proposed revisions by Parent to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and any other information provided by Parent in
response to the Change of Recommendation Notice, that (x) in the case of an
Intervening Event, the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to
effect such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the failure of the Board of 

 



48  Directors of the Company to effect such Change of Recommendation and
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_ would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall deliver a new Change of
Recommendation Notice to Parent in accordance with clause (ii) above in
connection with any change to the facts and circumstances specified in such
Change of Recommendation Notice or any material amendment to any Alternative
Transaction proposal (including any increase in the consideration payable
pursuant thereto in response to any adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement made by Parent) and shall comply again with the requirements
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, except that the Notice Period shall be two
(2) Business Days instead of five (5); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_
(regarding Superior Proposals) during any Notice Period.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to shareholders), (ii) issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder (which in no
event shall be deemed a Change of Recommendation) or (iii) making any other
disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to
make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event the Board of Directors of
the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation except in accordance
with _Section 5.4(d)_.

 

(f) The approval of the Companys Board of Directors for purposes of causing
any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be irrevocable and unconditional to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and no Change of Recommendation or other
action shall change such approval.

 

(g) The Company agrees that any breach of this _Section 5.4_ (i) by any Main
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) by any officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any director of any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Other Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is acting with the express permission or instruction of the
Company or such Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
5.4_ by the Company for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Change of Recommendation_ " shall mean any action or resolution by the
Board of Directors of the Company to (A) withdraw, qualify, withhold, amend
or modify in any manner meaningfully adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, or in each case propose to the holders of Shares to do so, (B)
fail to include the Company Recommendation in any materials distributed the

 



49  holders of Shares in connection with this Agreement, or (C) fail to reaffirm
the Company Recommendation publicly or to the holders of Shares within two (2)
Business Days following a request by Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall
only be entitled to make three (3) such requests. Any disclosure by the
Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof to the holders of
Shares relating to any determination or other action by the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to any
Alternative Transaction other than a "stop, look and listen" statement of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board
of Directors of the Company expressly reaffirms its Company Recommendation in
such disclosure.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written proposal for an
Alternative Transaction, made by any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) and which did not arise from a material breach of the Companys
obligations under this _Section 5.4_, that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (x) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and
conditions without undue delay, and if consummated (y) would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger (which for purposes of this Agreement shall mean
a proposal which values all of the Shares in excess of $825,000,000 (minus
the amount of the Recapitalization Dividend, if already paid to the Companys
stockholders) plus the time value attributed to the difference in the equity
value proposed by such Alternative Transaction and $825,000,000 (minus the
amount of the Recapitalization Dividend, if already paid to the Companys
stockholders), using a discount rate of 5%, taking into account the reasonably
anticipated closing date of each transaction). For purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal," each reference to "25%" in the definition of
"Alternative Transaction" shall be replaced with "100%".

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material development or change in
material circumstances, which development or change first occurred or arose
after the date of this Agreement and the existence and consequences of which
development or change were not known by, or were not reasonably foreseeable
to, the Board of Directors of the Company on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, and which development or change in material circumstances do not
relate to (A) developments or changes in the industries in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate, including general changes in Law or regulation
across such industries, changes in paper pricing or commodity pricing, (B) the
timing of any regulatory approvals required by this Agreement, (C) any
Alternative Transaction or an inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Transaction, or the
consequences thereof, (D) changes in general economic or political conditions
or the securities, credit or financial markets in general, (E) any acts of
terrorism or war, (F) changes in GAAP or the interpretation thereof or (G)
the fact that the Company exceeds internal or published projections.

 



50 Section 5.5 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC (A) a

") or (B) in the event that the Company does not receive written consents from
its stockholders sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval in
accordance with _Section 5.5(c)_, a prospectus and proxy statement relating
to the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Prospectus/Proxy Statement_ ") and
(ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and the
Form S-4 (which may be made as a single filing). Parent and the Company each
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement, Form S-4, the
Prospectus/Information Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Proxy Statement, Form S-4, the
Prospectus/Information Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement effective as
long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent shall also take any action reasonably required to
be taken under any applicable Law in connection with the issuance and
reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or Verso First Lien Notes in
the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action. Parent and the Company shall provide each
other and their respective Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Prospectus/Information Statement, Prospectus/Proxy

good faith any comments proposed by the other party for inclusion in the
Prospectus/Information Statement, Prospectus _/_ Proxy Statement, Proxy

the qualification of the Parent Common Stock and/or Verso First Lien Notes
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any written request by the SEC for amendment of the Form S-4.
Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise the other party in a

including comments reasonably proposed by such party), will use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Prospectus/Information Statement,
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, Proxy Statement or Form S-4, as applicable. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or
the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Prospectus/Information Statement, Prospectus/Proxy
Statement, Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, as applicable, so that on the date
the Prospectus/Information Statement or the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as
applicable, is mailed to stockholders of the Company, the Proxy Statement is
mailed to stockholders of Parent, or the Form S-4 becomes effective under the
Securities Act, it would not include any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under

 



51  which they were made, not misleading, the discovering party shall notify the
other party in a reasonably prompt manner and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Prospectus/Information Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement,
as applicable, and the Form S-4, to be disseminated to the holders of Company
Common Stock as promptly as practicable, and, in any event, not later than one
(1) Business Day with respect to the Principal Stockholders,

or Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as applicable, or the Form S-4, and the
expiration of any waiting period with respect to, the Form S-4, and, if
necessary in order to comply with applicable securities Laws, after the
Prospectus/Information Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as applicable,
shall have been so disseminated, promptly circulate an amended
Prospectus/Information Statement or Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as applicable,
and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

 

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary, proper or advisable in
accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents
(including Section 2.11 of the Companys bylaws) to seek the written consent
to the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, by the holders of Company Common
Stock holding at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock by a date that is no later than the later of (i) five (5)
Business Days after the date the Form S-4 becomes effective and (ii) the date
that is forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement (the "
_Stockholder Approval Deadline_ "). The Company will, except in the case of a
Change of Recommendation, through its Board of Directors, recommend that
its stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts in
accordance with applicable Law to obtain from its stockholders written
consents in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to take all other
lawful action necessary, proper or advisable to seek to secure the vote or
consent of its stockholders required by the Company Organizational Documents
and applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 

(d) In the event that the Company does not receive effective written consents
from its stockholders sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval
in accordance with _Section 5.5(c)_ on or prior to the Stockholder Approval
Deadline, subject to the fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the
Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company Organizational Documents, all action necessary to convene a meeting
of holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be
taken. Subject to _Section 5.4_ of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall recommend, and take all lawful action to solicit, such

affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Alternative Transaction.

 



52 (f) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement and Form S-4 to be disseminated to the holders of

shall have been so disseminated, promptly circulate an amended Proxy Statement
and Form S-4, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take, or cause their respective
Subsidiaries to take, promptly all actions, and to do, or cause to be done
(with respect to their respective Subsidiaries), promptly and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and

with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit
counsel for the other party a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and

Person may assert under applicable Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby in order to assure satisfaction of the conditions to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or
eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and every impediment under any Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, in
each case so as to enable the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

services or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries and (z) any other actions that after the Closing would limit the
freedom of action of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or
its Subsidiaries (including the Companys or the Surviving Corporations)
assets, businesses, services, products, product lines, licenses or other
operations or interests therein, in each case as may be required under or in
connection with any applicable Laws in order to obtain all consents from any
Governmental Entity to the transactions contemplated hereby (including
expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether imposed by Law or
agreement) and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the consummation of the Merger by the End Date; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be required to take, or cause their respective Subsidiaries
to take, any Settlement Action that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a

 



54  Non-Required Effect after the Effective Time on Parent and its Subsidiaries
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any action having the
effect described above being referred to herein as a " _Non-Required Remedy_
"). Neither party shall, without the other partys prior written consent,
commit to any extension of any waiting period under any Law, withdraw any
filing or agree not to consummate the Merger. If requested by Parent, the
Company shall take any action or make any agreement required by any
Governmental Entity under any applicable Law; _provided_ that any such action
or agreement is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and would not
result in a the imposition of any Non-Required Remedy. With respect to any
proposed Settlement Action, neither party shall take any action or make any
agreement required by any Governmental Entity under any applicable Law without
the written consent of the other party.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a Governmental Entity or any other
person is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law, each of the Company
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, Parent, after consultation with the Company and giving
reasonable consideration to the Companys views, shall be entitled to direct
the defense against any investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with,
any Governmental Entity or other Person relating to the Merger or
regulatory filings under applicable Law and shall use reasonable best efforts
to do so. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Parent from (if it so
chooses) opposing by refusing to consent to, through litigation or otherwise,
any request, attempt or demand by any Governmental Entity or other person for
any divestiture, hold separate condition or any other restriction with respect
to any assets, businesses or product lines of either Parent or the Company, in
each case, to the extent doing so would not and would not reasonably be
expected to prevent the Closing from occurring by the End Date.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the
issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not
issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity.

 



55 Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any Company
Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof or in any
indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors or officers copies of which have been provided to
Parent prior to the date hereof, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or
former directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of
the covenants contained in this _Section 5.9_.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent the Company was permitted
by applicable Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 145 of the
DGCL), provide indemnification to its directors and officers, indemnify and
hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing,
subject to the undertaking described below) each current and former director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party following receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately
determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person was not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 5.9_), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
charge, action, suit, litigation, proceeding, audit or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer or
director in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company), and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to indemnify any Indemnified
Parties to the extent such indemnification would not be permitted to be
provided by the Company under the DGCL (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Section 145 of the DGCL). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Action. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this  _Section 5.9(b)_ with respect to any Action
shall notify Parent of such Action promptly after becoming aware thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure actually
prejudices Parent.

 



56 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best
efforts to purchase comparable insurance for such six (6)-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement. At the
Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. In no event
shall the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the " _Base Amount_ ") in
respect of such "tail" policy or other coverage required to be obtained
pursuant to this  _Section 5.9_, and if the cost of such policy or coverage
would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for the Base Amount.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.
The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties.

 

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the continuing or surviving corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partys or
its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries operations.

  



57 Section 5.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to remain in compliance with the
applicable listing or maintenance requirements and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the NYSE.

 

Section 5.12 Financing.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, taking into account, with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters,
the expected timing of the Trigger Date, the Expiration Dates, the Marketing
Period and, with respect of the New NewPage Term Loan Facility, the provisions
of _Section 5.20(d)_, in respect of each of the facilities contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters, to take or cause to be taken, all actions to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or customary to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing, on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letters and any Fee Letter, to
the extent applicable, including using reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain
in effect the Debt Commitment Letters and the Existing Credit Agreement
Amendments in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof
until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to
negotiate and/or enter into the Definitive Debt Financing Documents on or
prior to the expiration of the applicable Debt Commitment Letter(s) (each
such date, an " _Expiration Date_ ") on the terms specifically set forth in
the term sheets and the other exhibits attached to the Debt Commitment Letters
(after giving effect to the "market flex" in the Fee Letters), the proviso in
the second to last sentence of Section 15 of the Debt Commitment Letters and
any upfront, arrangement or agency fees specifically set forth in the Fee
Letters, or with the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, on terms that are in the good faith judgment of
Parent in the aggregate not materially less favorable to each of Parent and
the Company than the terms specifically set forth in the term sheets and
other exhibits attached to the Debt Commitment Letters (after giving effect
to the "market flex" in the Fee Letters), the proviso in the second to last
sentence of Section 15 of the Debt Commitment Letters and any upfront,
arrangement or agency fees specifically set forth in the Fee Letters, (iii)
to satisfy (or if deemed reasonably advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of)
on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in the Debt Financing
that are within its control (other than any condition where the failure to be
so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish the
information required under this _Section 5.12_) as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Existing Credit Agreement Amendments, and to
comply with all of its material obligations pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters and the Existing Credit Agreement Amendments, (iv) to cause the
funding of the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (v) to exercise any rights Parent may have
under the Debt Commitment Letters to extend the Expiration Dates in accordance
with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters and to negotiate and agree
with the Lenders to further extend such Expiration Dates beyond the
commitment periods provided for therein (to the extent specified in _Section
5.20(d)_), and (vi) to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters
and/or the Existing Credit Agreement Amendments, including by pursuing
litigation against the lenders in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , solely
with respect to this clause (vi), that the Trigger Date shall have occurred
and all of the conditions to the Lenders obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letters to the funding of the New NewPage Term Loan Facility or the
New NewPage ABL Facility, as applicable, have been satisfied or waived.

 



58 (b) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment
Letters, the Fee Letters or the Existing Credit Agreement Amendments without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Parent may from time to time without the Companys
consent enter into discussions regarding, and may amend, replace, supplement
or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under the Existing Credit
Agreement Amendments and/or enter into other arrangements, amendments and
agreements of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters relating to the
Debt Financing, so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date or the
Closing, and the terms (with respect to terms that are specifically set forth
in the term sheets and other exhibits attached to the Debt Commitment Letters
(after giving effect to the "market flex" in the Fee Letters), the proviso in
the second to last sentence of Section 15 of the Debt Commitment Letters and
any upfront, arrangement or agency fees specifically set forth in the Fee
Letters) are not, in the aggregate, materially less beneficial to Parent or
the Company than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, the Fee
Letters and Existing Credit Agreement Amendments as in effect on the date of
this Agreement or would not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the value, rights and priorities of the Verso First Lien
Notes, and would not have the effect of (I) reducing or being reasonably
expected to reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt
Financing, unless the financing is increased by such amount), or (II)
adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, the Existing Credit Agreement
Amendments or any Fee Letter or, if definitive agreements are executed prior
to the Closing Date, the ability of the Company or any other borrower under
such definitive agreements related to the Debt Commitment Letters to enforce
its rights against the other parties to such definitive agreements or Parents
ability to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall provide the Company with reasonable advance notice of any such
amendment, replacement, waiver, modification or agreement. The Company shall
not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision under the Definitive Debt Financing Documents
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld. The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable
advance notice of any such amendment, replacement, waiver, modification or
agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt Commitment
Letters", "Fee Letters", "Existing Credit Agreement Amendments" and the
"Definitive Debt Financing Documents" shall include such documents
as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 5.12_.
None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries existing as of the date hereof
(including Merger Sub or its successor) may guarantee any Debt Commitment
Letters, Definitive Debt Financing Documents or alternative financing
obtained in substitution therefor, but for purposes of clarity, such
prohibition shall not apply to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries existing
as of the date hereof.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.12(a)_ and _Section
5.12(b)_, at any time prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of, and the opportunity to comment on, (A) its knowledge
of any material breach or default or termination

 



59  by any party to any Existing Credit Agreement Amendment or, in the case of
any Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter, any breach or default or termination
by any party thereto or (B) the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any material breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Existing Credit
Agreement Amendment or, in the case of any Debt Commitment Letter or Fee
Letter, any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party thereto.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of material developments in its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing and substantially concurrently therewith provide copies of all
final or substantially final Definitive Debt Financing Documents provided to
the lenders to the Company. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letters (after giving effect to the "market flex" in the Fee Letters) and the
Existing Credit Agreement Amendments and such portion is reasonably required
to fund the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration, the Repayment Amount
and/or (if applicable in accordance with _Section 5.20_) the Recapitalization
Dividend, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing for such portion
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event
with terms and conditions not materially less favorable (as determined in the
good faith judgment of Parent) to Parent, the Company and to the holders of
the Verso First Lien Notes than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters (after giving effect to the "market flex" in the Fee
Letters), the Fee Letters and the Existing Credit Agreement Amendments.
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all contracts
or other arrangements pursuant to which any such alternative financing source
shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing.
Any alternative financing secured by Parent shall be deemed to be part of the
Debt Financing for purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice: (A) of its knowledge of any material breach or default or
termination by any party to any Definitive Debt Financing Documents, or (B)
of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any material breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Definitive Debt Financing Documents.

(d) At and prior to the Closing or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing
Date, as applicable, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other
representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide, in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the issuance and registration of the
Note Consideration, all reasonable cooperation requested by Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, including (i) execution of customary authorization
letters with respect to Offering Documents, participating in a reasonable and
customary number of meetings, drafting sessions, presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions and sessions with prospective lenders, investors
and rating agencies and assisting Parent in obtaining ratings as contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters or as otherwise reasonably necessary for the
Debt Financing (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties
acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and
purchasers of, the Debt Financing and senior management and representatives,
with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and its external
auditors and advisors), (ii) assisting with the preparation of Offering
Documents required in connection with the Debt Financing solely to the extent
relating to the Companys historical financial statements and other
information and operations), and requesting any consents of accountants for
use of their

 



60  historical reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing
(including the execution and delivery of customary representation letters in
connection with bank information memoranda relating to the Companys
historical financial statements and other information and reviewing and
commenting on Parents draft of a business description and "Managements
Discussion and Analysis" of the Companys (but not the Surviving
Corporations) financial statements to be included in offering documents
contemplated by the Debt Financing), (iii) preparing and furnishing to Parent
and the Lenders as promptly as practicable all Required Information to
assist in preparation of the Offering Documents, (iv) providing monthly
financial statements within thirty (30) days of the end of each month prior to
the Closing Date and providing annual financial statements within seventy five
(75) days of the end of fiscal years ending December 31, 2013 and December
31, 2014 with respect to the Companys year-end financial results for such
periods, in all cases prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis and that fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows (subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments and the lack of footnote disclosures), (v) informing Parent
if the Company shall have knowledge of any facts that would likely require the
restatement of its financial statements, (vi) assisting in obtaining customary
accountants reports and comfort letters, field exams, surveys, engineering
reports, collateral audits and appraisals (including providing reasonable
access at reasonable times to Parent, the Lenders or any lenders in connection
with the Debt Financing and their respective agents to all Company-Owned Real
Property for such purposes) and title insurance, and to permit and/or
facilitate environmental and other inspections, title information, and other
documentation and items related to the Debt Financing, as
reasonably requested by Parent, (vii) causing the Companys independent
public accountants to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent (including any permission as may be
required from the Companys independent public accountants in connection with
the use of the Required Information), (viii) to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, assisting with the preparation and negotiation of, and
facilitating the execution and delivery of, any pledge and security
documents, guarantees, loan agreements, indentures, purchase agreements, and
other definitive financing documents, legal opinions and officers
certificates as may be requested by Parent (including delivering a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (or at Parents
option, a solvency opinion from an independent investment bank or valuation
firm of nationally recognized standing) with respect to solvency matters in
the form set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment Letters), (ix) taking
customary and commercially reasonable actions necessary to (A) permit the
prospective Lenders involved in the Debt Financing, upon reasonable advance
notice at reasonable times, to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purposes of establishing collateral arrangements as of the Closing
Date or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as applicable and
(B) assisting Parent to establish or maintain, effective as of the Closing
Date, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements, in each case in connection with the Debt Financing, (x) using
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent to obtain required waivers, consents,
estoppels and approvals from other parties to material leases, encumbrances
and contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
to arrange discussions among Parent, the Lenders and any lenders in connection
with the Debt Financing with other parties to such material leases,
encumbrances and contracts as of the Closing Date or the New NewPage Term Loan
Facility Closing Date, as applicable, (xi) taking

 



61  all legally permissible corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing Date or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as
applicable, reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or customary to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing, and to permit the proceeds of
the Debt Financing to be made available to Parent on the Closing Date on the
New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as applicable, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (xii) providing customary payoff
letters (including a payoff letter for the NewPage Existing Debt acceptable to
Parent and executed by the holders of the NewPage Existing Debt),
Lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the Closing
or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as applicable, to allow
for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the Closing Date or the
New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as applicable, of all
Indebtedness and Liens under the NewPage Existing Debt, (xiii) furnishing
Parent and the Lenders with all documentation and other information required
by Governmental Entities with respect to the Debt Financing under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including
without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent that such documentation
and information has been reasonably requested at least eight (8) days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing
Date, as applicable, and (xiv) facilitating the execution and delivery of the
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing on the terms contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters (after giving effect to the "market flex" in
the Fee Letters) or as otherwise reasonably necessary in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ that, prior to the Closing Date, none of the
Company or any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment or
other fee, incur any other liability or obligation or provide or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing, other than
as required pursuant any Definitive Debt Financing Documents entered into in
respect of the New NewPage Term Loan Facility and the New NewPage ABL Facility
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to update the Required Information on a
prompt basis and provide such updates to Parent as may be necessary such that
(i) such Required Information is Compliant at all times, and (ii) such
Required Information, as updated, meets the applicable requirements set forth
in the definition of "Required Information". For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the
cooperation of the Company under this _Section 5.12(d)_ at any reasonable
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date
hereof and the Closing Date or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing
Date, as applicable. In addition, the Company agrees that, upon Parents
reasonable request, it will supplement the Required Information so that
Parent may most effectively access the financing markets. All non-public or
otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or
its officers, advisors or representatives shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. If, in connection with a
marketing effort for the Debt Financing, Parent requests the Company to file a
current report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material
non-public information with respect to the Company, which Parent reasonably
determines to include in a customary bank information memorandum or other
Offering Documents for such Debt Financing, then, with the Companys consent,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld and  _provided_ that the
Companys consent shall not be required with respect to information appearing
on _Schedule 5.12(d)_ to this Agreement, upon the Companys review of and
reasonable satisfaction with such filing, the Company shall file such

 



62  current report on Form 8-K. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the
Company, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees and representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this  _Section
5.12(d_) and any information used in connection therewith (other than
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to Parent in
writing by the Company expressly for use therewith)), in each case, other than
to the extent that such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arise from
the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, with respect to any
material breach of this Agreement or with respect to any material misstatement
or omission in any information provided hereunder in writing by the Company
or any of its Affiliates expressly for use in connection with the Debt
Financing, and other than in the event that either (x) the New NewPage Term
Loan Facility is funded or (y) the New NewPage ABL Facility shall have been
entered into, in which in each such case such indemnification obligation will
terminate and will be of no further force and effect solely with respect to
the New NewPage Term Loan Facility and/or the New NewPage ABL Facility, as
applicable. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, this indemnification
shall survive termination of this Agreement. The Company hereby consents to
the use of the Companys logos and trademarks solely in connection with the
Debt Financing in a form and manner mutually agreed with the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such logos and trademarks are used solely in a
manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Board of Directors of the Company and
officers of the Company, and the board of directors and officers of any
Subsidiary of the Company prior to the Closing or the New NewPage Term Loan
Facility Closing Date, as applicable, shall not be required, prior to the
Closing or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as applicable, to
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments in
connection with the Debt Financing or pursuant to which any portion of the
Debt Financing is obtained or execute any of such agreements, documents or
instruments, and no Subsidiary shall be required to execute, prior to the
Closing or the New NewPage Term Loan Facility Closing Date, as applicable, any
documents contemplated by the Debt Financing (in each case, other than any
authorization or representation letters described in clause (i) above).

(e) Once the Company shall in good faith believe that it has delivered the
Required Information pursuant to  _Section 5.12(d)_, it may deliver to
Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed
such delivery). Parent shall be entitled, for a period of three (3) Business
Days following Parents receipt of such notice, to deliver a written notice
to the Company to the effect that Parent in good faith reasonably believes
that the Company has not completed delivery of the Required Information
(stating with reasonable specificity, to the extent known by Parent, which
Required Information the Company has not delivered). If Parent fails to
deliver such notice that the Company has not completed delivery of the
Required Information within such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
shall be deemed to have delivered the Required Information at the end of such
three (3) Business Day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set
forth in this _Section 5.12(e)_ shall relieve the Company of its obligations
under  _Section 5.12(d)_ to update, supplement and refresh the Required

time or from time to time, Parent reasonably believes that it requires
additional information for purposes of marketing and syndicating and
completing the Debt Financing, and the Company is required to provide such
information pursuant to _Section 5.12(d)_, the Company shall provide such
information, and the Companys delivery of the Required Information shall not
be deemed to be complete until such additional information has been delivered.

cause the requisite amount of holders of the _Verso_ Junior Notes to enter
into support agreements and/or provide such holders written consent to the
Exchange Offers, the Consent Solicitations and the other transactions
contemplated hereby so that the Exchange Offers, the Consent Solicitations and
the other transactions contemplated hereby will not result in a breach of or
default under the Indentures.

Section 5.14 _Verso Junior Notes_.

 

(a) Provided that the Company has provided Parent with the notice described in
_Section 5.12(e)_ that it has delivered to Parent the Required Information,
Parent shall not have delivered the notice described under _Section 5.12(e)_
alleging that the Company has not delivered the Required Information, and the

elapsed, then on or about January 13, 2014, subject to Parents reasonable
good faith determination that such commencement is commercially advisable at
such time due to prevailing market conditions, or otherwise as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Verso Paper Holdings to commence offers to exchange
securities of Verso Paper Holdings or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for
the Verso Junior Notes in an amount sufficient to satisfy the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1(e)_, and separate or concurrent consent solicitations
(the " _Consent Solicitations_ ") to amend, eliminate or waive certain
sections of the applicable Indentures in order to permit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the applicable documentation in
connection therewith, including the offer to exchange, consent solicitation
statement, related letters of transmittal and consent, supplemental indentures
and other related documents (the " _Exchange Offer Documents_ "), with respect

Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 issued pursuant to that certain Indenture

64  and, collectively with the Verso Second Lien Notes, and any notes received
in exchange for the Verso Senior Subordinated Notes and the Verso Second Lien
Notes in connection with the Exchange Offer, the " _Verso Junior Notes_ ",
and the " _Indentures_ ", as applicable), in each case on such terms and
conditions, including pricing terms, determined by Parent in its sole
discretion (but in any event consistent with _Schedule 6.1(e)_ hereof), to be
consummated prior to or at the Effective Time (collectively, including the
Consent Solicitations, the " _Exchange Offers_ "). Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make a public announcement regarding the Exchange
Offers, containing such information as determined in its sole discretion, on
or promptly following the date hereof.

 

(b) At and prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, officers, employees,

that all such Required Information meets the definition of Required
Information during such twenty-five (25) Business Day period; (iv) agreeing to
deliver such officers certificates, as are reasonable and customary and as
are, in the good faith determination of the persons executing such officers
certificates, accurate; (v) taking all legally permissible corporate actions,

to the Closing Date, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall
be required to pay any commitment or other fee, incur any other liability or
obligation or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Exchange Offers; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, indemnify and hold harmless the Company
and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Exchange
Offers (including any action taken in accordance with this _Section
5.14(b)_) and any information used in connection therewith (other than
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to Parent in
writing by the Company expressly for use therewith), in each case, other than
to the extent that such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arise from
the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or its
Affiliates, with respect to any material breach of this Agreement of or
with respect to any material misstatement or omission in any information
provided hereunder in writing by the Company or any of its Affiliates
expressly for use in connection with the Exchange Offers. This indemnification
shall 

 



65  survive termination of this Agreement. The Board of Directors and officers
of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall not be required, prior to the
Closing, to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments in connection with the Exchange Offers or execute any of such
agreements, documents or instruments, and no Subsidiary shall be required to
execute, prior to the Closing, any documents contemplated by the Exchange

(c) In connection with the Exchange Offers, upon exchange of the _Verso_
Second Lien Notes and Verso Senior Subordinated Notes sufficient to satisfy
the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ and receipt of the necessary
consents required to amend the Indentures, Parent will cause Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries to consummate the
Exchange Offers and to enter into supplemental indentures reflecting the

and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the trustees of the
applicable Indentures to promptly enter into such supplemental indentures at
or prior to the Closing.

Parent of any proceedings commenced after the date hereof against the Company

hereby (each, a " _Shareholder Litigation_ "), (b) keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such Shareholder Litigation, (c) give Parent the
opportunity to participate in any such Shareholder Litigation and to consult
with the Company and its legal counsel regarding the defense or settlement

properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either
party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

 

Section 5.17 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the date that is the six (6) month anniversary thereof (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and/or its applicable Subsidiaries to provide, to each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who continues to be
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time
(the " _Continuing Employees_ "), severance benefits pursuant to, and in
accordance with the terms of the Escanaba Paper Company, Luke Paper Company,
NewPage Wisconsin System Inc., Rumford Paper Company and Wickliffe Paper
Company LLC Severance Pay Plan for Non-Union Employees, effective September 2,
2011, and the NewPage Corporation Severance Pay Plan for Non-Union
Employees, effective September 2, 2011, as applicable, to the extent such
Continuing Employees were covered by such plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



66 (b) With respect to any benefit plans in which any Continuing Employees first
become eligible to participate during the two (2) year period following the
Effective Time and in which such Continuing Employees did not participate
prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to (i) for the plan year in which participation in the
New Plans occurs, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all pre-
existing conditions (with respect to health coverage), exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which the
Continuing Employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) for the plan year in which participation in the New Plans occurs, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing Employee credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid by each such Continuing Employee and his
or her eligible dependents prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit
Plan that is a group health plan (to the extent that such credit was given
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
New Plans in which such Continuing Employee participates after the Effective
Time for the same plan year; and (iii) recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accrual or early
retirement subsidies or with respect to any equity-based plan) in any New
Plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, to the extent such service is taken into account under the
applicable New Plan (to the extent such service was recognized for the
same purpose under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan); _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply under any defined benefit pension plans or to
the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

 

(c) Parent and the Company agree to implement the retention program described
in _Section 5.17(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and/or its applicable
Subsidiaries to recognize the unions that are parties to the collective
bargaining agreements set forth in _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as the bargaining representatives for the employees
covered by such collective bargaining agreements to the extent required by
the terms of such agreements. Parent further agrees, to the extent required by
the terms of such agreements, to cause the Surviving Corporation and/or its
applicable Subsidiaries to either (i) assume and apply to the employees
covered thereby (collectively, the " _Union Employees_ ") the applicable
collective bargaining agreements listed in _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; or (ii) negotiate new agreements with the unions
that are parties to such collective bargaining agreements establishing the
terms and conditions of employment to be effective with respect to the
employees covered thereby. To the extent required by any collective bargaining
agreement listed in  _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
Parent further agrees to provide in writing to the Company reasonable
assurances that it has complied with the requirements set forth in the
preceding sentence.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall be
construed to (i) establish, modify, or amend any particular Company Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) alter, limit or prevent

 



67  Parent from modifying, amending or terminating any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates or, after the Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan,
(iii) prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time) from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof or
any other Person, with respect to any compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, shall be obligated, from and after the
Closing, to provide any benefits, severance or compensation to the Companys
employees other than as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.17_.

 

Section 5.18 _Cooperation with Solvency Opinion_. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts, for purposes of
assisting (i) Murray Devine with respect to the Initial MD Solvency Opinion
and the MD Bring-Down Solvency Opinion, and (ii) the Person providing the
Company Recapitalization Solvency Opinion referenced in  _Section 6.1(j)_,
with respect to the Company Recapitalization Solvency Opinion, in each case,
with respect to the rendering of such opinions, to (a) make available their
respective officers, agents and other Representatives on a reasonable basis
and upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and (b) provide or
make available during normal business hours such information and
documents concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Company and Parent and each of their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, in the case of Parent, the Debt Financing,
as may reasonably be requested by Murray Devine or the Person providing the
Company Recapitalization Solvency Opinion referenced in _Section 6.1(j)_, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required to afford such access or disclose any such information if
it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries, or if such party determines in good faith, after consultation
with legal counsel, that such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any Law, Order or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement, or any obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party. In no
event shall Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, be
deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.18_ for purposes of _Section
6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ unless such breach is willful and material.

 

Section 5.19 _Confirmation of Capitalization_.

 

(a) On the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company

Company (the " _Company Share Statement_ ") setting forth, as of the Closing
Date, true and accurate calculations of (i) the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, (ii) the outstanding Company Stock Options, segregated as to
In-the-Money Options and Out-of-the-Money Options, and (iii) the outstanding
Company RSUs. Parent shall be entitled to rely exclusively, without
independent verification or investigation, upon the figures set forth in the
Company Share Statement and the underlying calculations in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



68 (b) On the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to the Company a certificate executed by an executive officer of
Parent (the " _Parent Share Statement_ ") setting forth, as of the Closing
Date, a true and accurate calculation of the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing, as well as the number, strike price and vesting terms for all Parent
Options outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. The Company shall be
entitled to rely exclusively, without independent verification or
investigation, upon the calculation of the Parent Common Stock set forth in
the Parent Share Statement and the underlying calculation in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.20 _Recapitalization Dividend_.

 

(a) Provided that the Company has provided Parent with the notice described in
_Section 5.12(e)_ that it has delivered to Parent the Required Information,
Parent shall not have delivered the notice described under _Section 5.12(e)_
alleging that the Company has not delivered the Required Information, and the
period of time specified in _Section 5.12(e)_ following delivery of the
Companys notice that it has delivered the Required Information shall have
elapsed, then on or about January 13, 2014, subject to Parents reasonable
good faith determination that such commencement is commercially advisable at
such time due to prevailing market conditions, or otherwise as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause Verso Paper Holdings to commence the marketing of the
New NewPage Term Loan Facility.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.20(d)_, if at any time following the date of this
Agreement (v) the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(j)_ has been
satisfied, (w) the Debt Commitment Letters are in effect and the conditions to
funding thereunder have been satisfied, (x) the Marketing Period in respect of
the New NewPage Term Loan Facility shall have ended, (y) the NewPage ABL Loan
Facility shall have been amended or replaced so as to allow the incurrence of
the New NewPage Term Loan Facility and (z) (A) the Verso Junior Noteholder
Consent shall have been obtained or (B) the Verso Junior Noteholder Consent
has not been obtained prior to sixty (60) days after the date of this
Agreement and the Company has either (I) waived its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(h)_, or (II) the time period set forth
in _Section 7.1(h)_ has expired without the Company terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, (the date on which the conditions set
forth in clauses (v), (w), (x), (y) and (z) have first been satisfied, the "
_Trigger Date_ "), then (a) the Company shall be entitled, at any time
following the Trigger Date so long as such Marketing Period shall not have re-
started, to deliver a written notice to Parent that the Company has
determined to pay the Recapitalization Dividend or (b) the Parent shall be
entitled, at any time following the Trigger Date to deliver a written notice
to Company that Parent intends to consummate the funding of the New NewPage
Term Loan Facility (the notice referred to in (a) or (b), a " _Pre-Closing
Funding Notice_ "). Promptly upon receipt of such Pre-Closing Funding Notice,
Parent and the Company shall be required to use their reasonable best efforts
to consummate the funding of the New NewPage Term Loan Facility as soon as
reasonably practical, and in no event after the date which is five (5)
Business Days following the Trigger Date (the " _Pre-Closing Funding Date_
"), subject to clause (c) below.

 



69 (c) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, upon receipt by the Company
of the proceeds of the New NewPage Term Loan Facility, the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following such receipt (and in any event on
or prior to the Closing Date), use such proceeds to pay the Repayment Amount,
to pay to the holders of Shares a one-time dividend equal to $250,000,000
less the Equity Award Carveout Amount (the " _Recapitalization Dividend_ ").
The costs of the issuance of the New NewPage Term Loan Facility and the New
NewPage ABL Facility if funded shall be paid by the Company.

(d) At any time following the Trigger Date but prior to the Pre-Closing
Funding Date, the Company may deliver a written notice (the " _Extension
Notice_ ") to Parent requesting that Parent use its reasonable best efforts to
extend the Expiration Date in the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ that the
Company shall only be entitled to make such request if the Companys Board of
Directors has reasonably determined, after consultation with its outside legal
and financial advisors, that the terms and conditions set forth in the
Definitive Debt Financing Documents are less favorable, as of the date of the
Extension Notice, than as would reasonably be likely to be negotiated were the
Expiration Date with respect thereto extended pursuant to this sentence. Upon
receipt of an Extension Notice, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts,
for a period of fifteen (15) days, to extend the Expiration Dates in the Debt
Commitment Letters. If Parent shall have successfully extended the Expiration
Date in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall continue to comply with
its obligations set forth in _Section 5.12(a)_ for a commercially reasonable
period of time thereafter, at which point, subject to the Marketing Period (if
restarted) having ended and the other conditions to the Trigger Date having
been satisfied (and continuing to be satisfied), either Parent or the Company
may deliver a Pre-Closing Funding Notice. If the Expiration Dates are unable
to be extended, then Parent and the Company shall be required to use
reasonable best efforts to consummate the funding of the New NewPage Term
Loan Facility as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than the
date that Parent determines that the Expiration Dates are unable to be
extended.

 

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that Parents sole obligation under
this _Section 5.20_ upon the occurrence of the Trigger Date shall be to use
reasonable best efforts to consummate the funding of New NewPage Term Loan
Facility on or prior to the Pre-Closing Funding Date, and in the event that
such funding does not occur on or prior to the Pre-Closing Funding Date, the
Companys sole and exclusive remedies for the failure of such funding to occur
shall be as set forth in _Section 7.3_ and _Section 9.5(c)._

 

(f) The Company further acknowledges that (x) any up-front fees and other
amounts payable to the Lenders in accordance with the Fee Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Documents in respect of the New NewPage Term Loan
Facility shall be paid out of the proceeds of the New NewPage Term Loan
Facility on the Pre-Closing Funding Date and (y) as between Parent and
the Company, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to pay any
of such costs, fees or expenses on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(g) The Company further acknowledges that (x) any up-front fees and other
amounts payable to the Lenders in accordance with any Fee Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Documents in respect of the New NewPage ABL Facility
shall be paid by the Company (whether or not out of the proceeds of the New
NewPage ABL Facility) if such New NewPage ABL Facility is entered into prior
to the Closing Date on the Pre-Closing Funding Date and (y) as between Parent
and the Company, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to pay
any of such costs, fees or expenses on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



70 (h) The Company further covenants and acknowledges that (i) the syndication
assistance provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of _Section
5.12_ shall continue to apply to the New NewPage Term Loan Facility after the
Pre-Closing Funding Date, (ii) the Definitive Debt Financing Documents shall
contain customary post-closing syndication assistance provisions applicable
to the Company in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters and (iii) the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with any such
syndication assistance provisions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Definitive Debt Financing Documents.

Section 5.21  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Times, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and interpretive
guidance of the SEC to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to Shares) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company and Parent or will become subject
to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.22 _Share Consideration Adjustment_.

(a) If (i) Parent has not consummated the Closing on or prior to August 31,
2014, (ii) but for the occurrence of any Share Consideration Adjustment
Triggers (as defined below) that occur on or after August 31, 2014, the
Closing would have been reasonably likely to have occurred on the date that
any such Share Consideration Adjustment Trigger has first occurred (the "
_Adjustment Trigger Date_ "), (iii) as of such Adjustment Trigger Date, the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ shall have then been satisfied (other
than those other conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied by
action taken at the Closing, subject to the Company confirming in good faith
that it reasonably believes that such other conditions are reasonably capable
of being satisfied at the Closing), and (iv) the Company has confirmed in an
irrevocable written notice delivered to Parent on the Adjustment Trigger Date
that but for the occurrence of any of the Share Consideration Adjustment
Triggers, the Company is ready, willing and able to effectuate the Closing
(the date upon which each of the conditions set forth in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) have been satisfied, the (" _Share Consideration Adjustment
Date_ "), then the Share Consideration Percentage shall be increased by 0.5%
for each full calendar month that elapses prior to the Closing and following
the Share Consideration Adjustment Date; _provided_ , that if either party
exercises its right to extend the End Date pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)_,
the percentage set forth in the definition of Share Consideration shall be
increased by 1.5% for each full calendar month that elapses during any such
extension (0.5% or 1.5%, as applicable, the " _Monthly Percentage Increase_
"); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the Share Consideration
Adjustment Date or the Closing occurs during a calendar month (as opposed to
at the beginning or at the end of a calendar month, as applicable), the
increase to the Share Consideration Percentage for such calendar month shall
equal the applicable Monthly Percentage Increase, multiplied by a fraction,
(x) in the case of the calendar month in which the Share
Consideration Adjustment Date occurs, the numerator of which is the number of
days in such calendar month following (but not including) the Share
Consideration Adjustment Date until and including the

 



71  last day of such calendar month, and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such calendar month, and (y) in the case of the calendar
month in which the Closing occurs, the numerator of which is the number of
days that have elapsed in such calendar month through and including the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
calendar month. As an illustrative example, if the Share Consideration
Adjustment Date occurs on September 15, 2014, and the Closing subsequently
occurs on November 15, 2014, the Share Consideration Percentage will increase
by an aggregate of 1.00% (0.5% for October, and 50% (15 of 30 days elapsed)
of the Monthly Percentage Increase (or 0.25%) for each of September and
November).

(b) In the event that the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of
the first sentence of _Section 5.22(a)_ have been satisfied, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the sole and exclusive consequence under this
Agreement relating to the failure of Parent to effectuate the Closing on or
prior to the Share Consideration Adjustment Date shall be the adjustment to
the Share Consideration Percentage set forth in _Section 5.22(a)_.

any provision of this Agreement by Parent or any of its Affiliates, (F)
the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(n_) shall not be reasonably capable
of being satisfied at the Closing solely as a result of the failure of the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ to be satisfied on or prior to the
date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ (provided,
that Parent shall be entitled, and have the burden, to prove that the failure

Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Side
Letters, if Parent or Merger Sub or the Company fails to effect the Closing
for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform
hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), then (x) a decree or order of specific performance or an
injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief against Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, as applicable, if and solely to the extent permitted by

and material breach of this Agreement, subject in all respects to the
limitations set forth in _Section 7.3(e)_, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies (whether at Law, in equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
parties hereto and any other Person against any of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Lenders, any Debt Financing Source or any other financing source of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and any of their respective former, current
or future, direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, attorneys, advisors or other
Representatives, or any of their respective successors or assigns (each a "
_Non-Recourse Person_ " and together, the " _Non-Recourse Persons_ ") for
any breach, liability, cost, expense, loss or damage suffered as a result
thereof or in connection therewith or related thereto. The parties acknowledge
and agree that no party hereto shall be entitled to money damages for any
breach hereof or of the Side Letters in the event that such party has
previously been paid the Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable.

(d) Except for the obligations of any Person party to a confidentiality
agreement with the Company or Parent or any Person party to an agreement with
respect to obligations arising on or after the Closing and for the obligations
of any Lender, any Debt Financing Source or other financing source that is a
party to the Definitive Debt Financing Documents, none of the Non-Recourse
Persons will have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any other Person) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters, or in respect of any other Contract,
document or theory of Law or equity or in respect of any representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at Law or
equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise, except in each case for (x) a
decree or order of specific performance or an injunction or injunctions or
other equitable relief against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, if and solely to the extent permitted by _Section 9.5_ or the
Side Letters, (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_
, and receipt of payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the
Termination Fee from the Company, as applicable, when and if payable, or (z)
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof and the ability
to seek money damages (in each case, to the extent money damages can be
proven) against Company, for the 

 



79  Companys willful and material breach of this Agreement, or Parent or Merger
Sub, for Parents or Merger Subs willful and material breach of this
Agreement, subject in all respects to the limitations set forth _Section
7.3(e)_. Without limiting the right of the Company to seek specific
performance of Parents rights under the Debt Commitment Letters (if and to
the extent permitted thereunder following an order of specific performance
pursuant to _Section 9.5_), the Company acknowledges and agrees that none of
the Lenders or Parents Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any other Person) if they
breach or fail to perform (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally
or otherwise) any of their obligations under their respective Debt Commitment
Letters (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Definitive Debt
Financing Documents). None of the Non-Recourse Persons shall have any
liability to the Company, its stockholders or any other Person relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
failure of such transactions to be consummated, in each case, other than with
respect to the Lenders, the Debt Financing Sources or other financing source
that are a party to the Definitive Debt Financing Documents.

 

(e) Parents and Merger Subs aggregate liability under this Agreement,
together with any liability for which Parent and Merger Sub are responsible
as a result of any breach of the Side Letters, together with any payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, shall not exceed under any circumstances
$27,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Maximum Liability Amount_ "). Following
termination of this Agreement, assuming the Parent Termination Fee is not due
and payable and/or has been paid, Parent shall be responsible for paying any
money damages, if any, arising from and payable to the extent due to any
willful and material breach by any Affiliate of Parent that is a party to the
Parent Affiliate Side Letter or the Lock-Up Side Letter; _provided_ that
Parent shall have no liability if such breach is not willful and material. The
Companys aggregate liability under this Agreement, together with any
liability of the Principal Stockholders under the Support Agreements to Parent
and its Affiliates and any payment of the Company Termination Fee shall not
exceed under any circumstances the Maximum Liability Amount; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company and the Principal Stockholders shall have no
liability for any breach of the Support Agreements that is not willful and
material.

 

(f) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Sections 7.3_ ,
_9.6_ and _9.13_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee
and the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not constitute a penalty
but are liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company and Parent, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the
Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee are payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision.

agent of the Parent under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing
