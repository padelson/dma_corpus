2.3. _Treatment of Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Notes_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement,
the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) has adopted appropriate resolutions and taken all other actions
necessary to provide that each Company Option heretofore granted under the
Company Option Plan or otherwise, whether or not currently vested or
exercisable immediately prior to the Closing Date, and which remains
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date, shall, at the Closing, be
cancelled, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right to

the Companys reasonable and good faith estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet,
(ii) a statement (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Statement") setting
forth the Companys reasonable and good faith estimate of the Closing Date
Net Working Capital and the components and calculations thereof, by reference
to the foregoing Closing Date Balance Sheet and (iii) a statement (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement") setting forth the
calculation of the amount by which the estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital as shown on the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital") either (A) exceeds the Target Net Working
Capital (such amount, the "Estimated Net Working Capital Excess Amount") or
(B) is less than the Target Net Working Capital (such amount, the
"Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount"). The estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet, Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement delivered pursuant to this _Section
2.4(a)_ shall be accompanied by all relevant backup materials and schedules,
in detail reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

(b) Within ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, the Company

Capital Statement") setting forth the Closing Date Net Working Capital and

Balance Sheet and (iii) a statement (the "Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement") setting forth the calculation of the amount by which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital as shown on the Net Working Capital
Statement either (A) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (as such amount
may be adjusted below, the "Net Working Capital Excess Amount") or (B) is
less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (as such amount may be adjusted
below, the "Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount"). The Closing Date Balance
Sheet, Net Working Capital Statement and Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be accompanied by
all relevant backup materials and schedules, in detail consistent with
the materials and detail provided by the Company pursuant to _Section
2.4(a)_.



 

23 (c) After receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement, the Equityholder Representative shall have
thirty (30) calendar days to review the Net Working Capital Statement and the
Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement. The Company shall give, or cause to
be given, to the Equityholder Representative reasonable access during standard
working hours to all documents, records and the employees of the Company used
in their preparation to the extent such employees are employed by the Company
at such time. Not later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of
receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement, the Equityholder Representative shall provide the
Company with a notice (a "Working Capital Dispute Notice") listing those
items, if any, to which the Equityholder Representative takes exception, which
notice shall also (i) specifically identify, and provide a reasonably detailed
explanation of the basis upon which the Equityholder Representative has
delivered such list, _including_ the applicable provisions of this Agreement
on which the dispute set forth in such Working Capital Dispute Notice is
based, (ii) set forth the amount of Closing Date Net Working Capital that the
Equityholder Representative has calculated based on the information contained
in the Net Working Capital Statement and (iii) specifically identify the
Equityholder Representatives proposed adjustment(s). Unless the Equityholder
Representative delivers the Working Capital Dispute Notice to the Company
setting forth the specific items disputed by the Equityholder Representative
on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the
Equityholder Representatives receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement
and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement, the Equityholder
Representative on behalf of the Equityholders shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement and such statements (and the calculations contained
therein) shall be final, binding and conclusive. If the Equityholder
Representative timely provides the Company with a Working Capital Dispute
Notice, the Equityholder Representative and the Company shall, within fifteen
(15) days following receipt of such Working Capital Dispute Notice by the
Company (the "Resolution Period"), use good faith efforts to resolve their
differences with respect to the items specified in the Working Capital Dispute
Notice (the "Disputed Items"), and all other undisputed items (and all
calculations relating thereto) shall be final, binding and conclusive. Any
written resolution by the Equityholder Representative and the Company during
the Resolution Period as to any Disputed Items shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

 

(d) If the Equityholder Representative and the Company do not resolve all
Disputed Items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items
remaining in dispute shall be submitted within fifteen (15) days following the
expiration of the Resolution Period to an accounting firm of national
reputation that is independent of Buyer, the Company or any Equityholder that
is an entity and that is reasonably acceptable to both the Equityholder
Representative and the Company to resolve the remaining matters in dispute
(the "Neutral Arbitrator"), and such firm shall be the Neutral Arbitrator for
all purposes of this _Section 2.4(d)_. The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an
arbitrator to determine only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute,
consistent with this _Section 2.4_, and shall request a statement from each
of the Equityholder Representative and the Company regarding such remaining
Disputed Items. The Neutral Arbitrator shall consider only those Disputed
Items that the Equityholder Representative on the one hand and the Company
on the other hand are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the
Neutral Arbitrator may not assign a value to any item greater

 



 

24  than the greatest value for such item claimed by any Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by any Party. The scope of the disputes
to be arbitrated by the Neutral Arbitrator is limited to whether the
preparation of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement were prepared in accordance with this Agreement, and
whether there were mathematical errors in the preparation of the Net Working
Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement, and the
Neutral Arbitrator is not to make any other determination. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be allocated between the Equityholder Representative and the
Company in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items
so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by such
Party (as finally determined by the Neutral Arbitrator) bears to the total
amount of such Disputed Items so submitted by such Party. In addition, the
Parties shall give the Neutral Arbitrator access to all documents, records and
employees as reasonably necessary to perform its function as arbitrator. The
Neutral Arbitrator shall deliver to the Equityholder Representative and the
Company a written determination (such determination to include a work sheet
setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at
such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Neutral Arbitrator by the Equityholder Representative and the Company) of the
Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within thirty (30) days
following receipt of such Disputed Items (or as soon thereafter as
practicable), which determination, absent manifest error, shall be final,
binding and conclusive, and judgment may be entered on the award. If either
the Equityholder Representative or the Company fails to submit a statement
regarding any Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within the
time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator or otherwise fails to give the
Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested, then the Neutral
Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely
submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by the
Equityholder Representative and the Company.

 

(e) The final, binding and conclusive Net Working Capital Statement and Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, in each case, based either upon
agreement by the Equityholder Representative and the Company, the written
determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_ or the Equityholder Representatives failure to notify the
Company, in accordance with this _Section 2.4_, of its objections to either
the Net Working Capital Statement or the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement (or any calculations contained therein) shall be the "Conclusive
Net Working Capital Statement" and the "Conclusive Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement," respectively.

 

(f) If there is a Net Working Capital Excess Amount, the Equityholder
Representative shall prepare a Future Payment Allocation Schedule showing the
portion of the Net Working Capital Excess amount to be paid to each
Equityholder and deliver such Future Payment Allocation Schedule to Buyer.
Within ten (10) Business Days following Buyers receipt of such Future
Payment Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall pay to each Equityholder the portion
of the Net Working Capital Excess Amount set forth opposite such
Equityholders name on such Future Payment Allocation Schedule in immediately
available funds by check or by wire transfer to such bank account or accounts
as may be specified on such Future Payment Allocation Schedule; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no amount shall be payable pursuant to this _Section 2.4(f)_
unless the aggregate Net Working Capital Excess Amount exceeds $[****], in
which case the full Net Working Capital Excess Amount shall be paid.



 

[****] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked
by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

 

25 (g) If there is a Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount, the
Equityholder Representative shall within ten (10) Business Days following the
determination of the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement, instruct the
Escrow Agent to release to the Company from the Working Capital Escrow Account
(or if the funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account are insufficient, then
first from the Working Capital Escrow Account until the Working Capital Escrow
Account has been fully depleted and then from the Indemnification Escrow
Account) an amount equal to the Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount in
immediately available funds by check or by wire transfer to such bank account
or accounts as the Company may specify; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
amount shall be payable pursuant to this  _Section 2.4(g)_ unless the
aggregate Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount exceeds [****], in which case
the full Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount shall be paid.

 

(h) Any Net Working Capital Excess Amount shall be deemed to be an increase in
the Purchase Price and any Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount shall be
deemed to be a decrease in the Purchase Price for purposes of this Agreement.
Absent fraud or willful misconduct in the preparation of the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement or Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment
Statement, neither the Equityholder Representative nor any Equityholder shall
have any responsibility for any amount of the Net Working Capital Deficiency
other than by means of deductions from the Working Capital Escrow Account or
the Indemnification Escrow Account.

2.5. _Indemnification Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) _Indemnification Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the
Indemnification Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "Indemnification
Escrow Account") to be established by Buyer with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the "Escrow Agent") to be held by the Escrow Agent, pursuant to
the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the "Escrow Agreement"). Buyer shall be treated for Tax purposes
as the owner of all amounts held in the Indemnification Escrow Account unless
and until such amounts are released therefrom, in which case such amounts
shall be treated for Tax purposes as having been paid by Buyer to the Party to
whom such amounts are released.

 

(b) _Release of Indemnification Escrow Amount_. Following the Indemnification
Escrow Release Date, each Equityholder shall be entitled to receive that
portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account, if any, that is determined in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) _Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses_. Any fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent shall be paid one half by Buyer and one half by the Equityholder
Representative (for the account of the Equityholders), with amounts attributed
to the Equityholder Representative and known at the Closing to be included in
Transaction Expenses. During the period in which the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (including any Retained Escrow Amount) is retained in the Escrow
Account, all interest or other income earned from the investment of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Earnings") shall be retained as
additional amounts in the Escrow Account and shall be reported for tax
purposes as income of Buyer, provided that within five (5) Business Days
following the end of each calendar quarter, forty-five percent (45%) of the
Escrow Earnings relating to each such calendar quarter shall be automatically
released to Buyer and shall no longer be part of the Indemnification Escrow
Account.

Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

 

26 2.6. _Working Capital Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) _Working Capital Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the
Working Capital Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "Working Capital
Escrow Account") to be established by Buyer with the Escrow Agent to be held
by the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to serve
as a source of payment for any Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount payable
to Buyer pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.4(g)_. Buyer shall be treated
for Tax purposes as the owner of all amounts held in the Working Capital
Escrow Account unless and until such amounts are released therefrom, in which
case such amounts shall be treated for Tax purposes as having been paid by
Buyer to the Party to whom such amounts are released.

 

(b) _Release of Working Capital Escrow Amount_. Within three (3) Business Days
following the payment of the Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount, if any,
or the determination of the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement showing a
Net Working Capital Excess Amount, if any, Buyer shall notify the Equityholder
Representative in writing of the amount remaining in the Working Capital
Escrow Account (the "Remaining Working Capital Escrow Amount"). The
Equityholder Representative shall prepare a Future Payment Allocation Schedule
showing the portion of the Remaining Working Capital Escrow Amount to be paid
to each Equityholder and deliver such Future Payment Allocation Schedule to
Buyer and the Escrow Agent. Within ten (10) Business Days following Buyers
and Escrow Agents receipt of such Future Payment Allocation Schedule, the
Escrow Agent shall distribute to each Equityholder the portion of the
Remaining Working Capital Escrow Amount set forth opposite such Equityholders
name on such Future Payment Allocation Schedule in immediately available
funds by check or by wire transfer to such bank account or accounts as may be
specified on such Future Payment Allocation Schedule.

 

2.7. _Distribution of Bonus Amount_.

 

(a) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to
Buyer a certificate (the "Participating Service Providers Certificate")
signed by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company setting
forth the names of those employees and consultants of the Company (the
"Participating Service Providers") who are entitled to receive, subject to
the terms set forth in any notice provided by the Company in writing to the
Participating Service Providers, as consideration for executing and delivering
the release contemplated by this _Section 2.7(a)_ and attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ , a portion of the Bonus Amount as set forth on such Participating
Service Provider Certificate. Prior to the Closing, the Company has delivered
to each Participating Service Provider for execution a general release of all
claims against the Company in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. With
respect to each Participating Service Provider who executes a general release
of all claims against the Company in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_
within forty-five (45) days following the delivery of such release to the
Participating Service Provider, and does not revoke such release, following
the expiration of any revocation period provided by Applicable Law, Buyer
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, subject to the immediately
following sentence, pay and distribute to each



 

27  such Participating Service Provider, each in his or her capacity as a
current or former service provider of the Company, as the case may be, who
complies with the procedures set forth in this  _Section 2.7(a)_ the portion
of the Bonus Amount as set forth on the Participating Service Provider
Certificate for such Participating Service Provider. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Bonus Amount shall not be distributed to a Participating Service
Provider until the general release of claims executed by such Participating
Service Provider becomes effective following the expiration of any applicable
revocation period. In the event a Participating Service Provider fails
to execute within forty-five (45) days following the Closing or revokes such
release during any applicable revocation period, then such Participating
Service Provider shall not receive any portion of the Bonus Amount. The
aggregate portion of the Bonus Amount that is not payable to all
Participating Service Providers is referred to herein as the "Unallocated
Bonus Amount".

 

(b) Promptly following the determination of the Unallocated Bonus Amount,
Buyer shall notify the Equityholder Representative as to the Unallocated
Bonus Amount. The Equityholder Representative shall prepare a Future Payment
Allocation Schedule showing the portion of the Unallocated Bonus Amount to be
paid to each Equityholder and deliver such Future Payment Allocation Schedule
to Buyer. Within ten (10) Business Days following Buyers receipt of such
Future Payment Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall pay to each Equityholder the
portion of the Unallocated Bonus Amount set forth opposite
such Equityholders name on such Future Payment Allocation Schedule in
immediately available funds by check or by wire transfer to such bank account
or accounts as may be specified on such Future Payment Allocation Schedule.

 

2.8. _Rights to Future Payments_. The right of each Equityholder to receive
the Future Payment Amounts, if any, or his, her or its portion of the
Equityholder Representatives Fund Amount, if any, shall not be evidenced by a
certificate or other instrument. The right of each Equityholder to receive the
Future Payment Amounts, if any, and the Equityholder Representatives Fund
Amount, if any, may not be offered, sold, pledged, assigned or otherwise
transferred by a Equityholder except by operation of law or by will or
intestate succession; _provided_ , _however_ , if a Equityholder is
an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act and a non-natural Person, such Equityholder may
offer, sell, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer its interest in the Future
Payment Amounts and the Equityholder Representatives Fund Amount, if any,
provided that such Equityholders transferee, assignee or pledgee is an
accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act and agrees to be bound by the restrictions on
transfer set forth in this _Section 2.8_ and _provided_ , _that_ such
Equityholder delivers an opinion of counsel in a form that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company stating that such offer, sale, pledge, assignment
or other transfer will be effected pursuant to a transaction that is exempt
from registration under the Securities Act.

 

2.9. _Escheat_. Neither Buyer nor the Company shall be Liable to any
Equityholder for any portion of the Purchase Price delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property escheat or similar law.
If any amounts payable to a Equityholder have not been claimed by such
Equityholder for a period of twelve (12) months following the date such
payment is due (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Purchase Price would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such Purchase Price shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.



 

28 2.10. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Buyer or the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Closing Payment Amount and any Future Payment
Amount or any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of United States federal, state or
local, or any foreign, Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by Buyer or
the Company, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in

if any individual Equityholder is named in such litigation, such Equityholder
shall have the right to tender defense), (vii) to hire or retain, at the sole
expense of the Equityholder, such counsel, investment bankers, accountants,

Representative shall determine the amounts to be paid to each Equityholder as

error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, or

action. Neither Buyer, the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall have any
Liability to any of the Equityholders or otherwise arising out of the acts

(e) _Indemnity; Costs and Expenses_. Each Equityholder shall, in proportion to
the portion of the Purchase Price plus the Equityholder Representatives Fund
Amount, if any, then previously received by such Equityholder (or if no
portion of the Purchase Price and the Equityholder Representatives Fund
Amount has been paid, in proportion to the portion of the Closing Payment
Amount to which such Equityholder is entitled), indemnify and defend the
Equityholder Representative and hold the Equityholder Representative harmless
against any loss, damage, cost, Liability or expense incurred without

under this Agreement. Any Liabilities, losses, penalties, fines, claims,
damages, out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including costs of defending claims
prior to the final adjudication or settlement of such claims) incurred by or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Equityholder Representative in
connection with the acceptance, performance and administration of his or her
duties as the Equityholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement
(including the hiring of legal counsel, accountants or auditors and other

foregoing arising out of the Equityholder Representatives fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct) and all fees payable hereunder to the
Equityholder Representative by the Equityholder ("Equityholder
Representatives Costs"), shall be paid as follows: (i) first by recourse to
the Equityholder Representatives Fund; and (ii) if such amounts held in the
Equityholder Representatives Fund are insufficient to pay for such
Equityholder Representatives Costs, then by recourse to any Future Payments
distributable to Equityholders; and (iii) if such amounts are insufficient to
pay such Equityholder Representatives Costs, then by recourse directly to
the Equityholders (in proportion to the portion of the Purchase Price plus the
Equityholder Representatives Fund Amount, if any, then previously received by
each such Equityholder, or if no portion of the Purchase Price and
Equityholder Representatives Fund Amount has been paid, in proportion to the
portion of the Closing Payment Amount to which such Equityholder is entitled).

 

(f) _Deposit of Equityholder Representative s Fund Amount_. At the Closing,
Buyer shall deposit with the Equityholder Representative the Equityholder
Representatives Fund Amount, which shall be held by the Equityholder
Representative in trust solely for the purpose of paying the expenses if any,
incurred by the Equityholder Representative in connection with this Agreement
(the "Equityholder Representatives Fund"). The deposit of the Equityholder
Representatives Fund Amount by Buyer with the Equityholder Representative 



 

31  shall discharge Buyers obligations with respect to such amount, and Buyer
shall not have responsibility or Liability for the manner in which the
Equityholder Representative administers the Equityholder Representatives
Fund, or for causing or ensuring that all or any portion of the Equityholder
Representatives Fund Amount is ultimately paid or distributed to the
Equityholders. Upon the Equityholder Representatives determination to
release the Equityholder Representatives Fund Amount then remaining, if any,
such remaining Equityholder Representatives Fund Amount shall be distributed
to Equityholders in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the
Company as amended and in effect immediately prior to the Closing as if the
transactions contemplated hereby constitute a Deemed Liquidation Event (as

their review of such annual updates provided by Buyer. Buyer shall promptly
(but no later than five (5) Business Days following the achievement of a
Milestone) notify the Equityholder Representative of the achievement of any
Milestone, provided that a press release issued by Buyer describing the
achievement of such Milestone shall constitute such notice. Promptly

supporting documentation reflecting the analysis and justification thereof.
Buyer and the Equityholder Representative shall thereafter attempt to resolve
the dispute as set forth in this _Section 2.11(h)_.

made by one Party to the other shall be honored in a timely fashion. All

Company is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, leased or operated or the nature of its activities make
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or

amendments thereto, have heretofore been delivered to Buyer and are accurate
and complete as of the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

equivalents) in any other corporation, partnership, trust, joint
venture, association, or other Person.

3.3. _Authorization_. The Company has all requisite power and authority, and
has taken all action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to perform

(a) _Schedule 3.13(a)_ lists as of the date hereof all "employee
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income

Section 3(37) of ERISA, and each other stock purchase, stock option,
restricted stock, severance, retention, employment, consulting, change-of-
control, collective bargaining, bonus, 



 

41  incentive, deferred compensation, employee loan, fringe benefit and any
other benefit plan, agreement, program, policy, commitment or other
arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA (including any related funding
mechanism now in effect or required in the future), whether formal or
informal, oral or written, in respect of any present or former officers,
directors, stockholders or other Workers of the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates, in each case sponsored, maintained, contributed or required
to be contributed to by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or under
which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any current or potential
Liability (each a "Benefit Plan," and collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). For
each Benefit Plan, true and complete copies of, where applicable, (i) the
three (3) most recent annual reports on Form 5500 (with schedules
and attachments) and associated summary annual reports, (ii) the actuarial
reports and results of all nondiscrimination tests for the last three (3) plan
years, and (iii) any plan document (or, in the case of an unwritten Benefit

(and any other documents relating to the funding or payment of benefits under
any Benefit Plan), employment agreement and other governing instrument,
document or employee communication, have been delivered to Buyer as of the
date hereof.

 

(b) No Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 or 4971 of the Code. No Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer plan" as
defined in Section 210(a) of ERISA or a "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, and none of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has
withdrawn at any time from any multiemployer plan, or incurred any withdrawal
Liability with respect to any multiemployer plan which remains unsatisfied,
and no events have occurred and no circumstances exist that would reasonably
be expected to result in any such Liability to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate.

(c) Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered in accordance
with its terms, and in compliance in all material respects in accordance with
the requirements of Applicable Law (including with the requirements of ERISA
and the Code). All insurance premiums with respect to any of the Benefit
Plans, and all contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any
of the Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith, have been made or paid by the due date thereof and all
contributions or payments for any period ending on or before the Closing Date

Date.

obtained a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype
plan and each such Benefit Plan has adopted all amendments necessary to comply
with the Code on or before the remedial amendment period deadline specified
for each such amendment pursuant to Section 401(b) of the Code or IRS
promulgations. The Company has provided to Buyer a true and compete copy of
the latest IRS determination or opinion letter with respect to each such
Benefit Plan and nothing has since occurred that could cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption and no such Benefit Plan has been operated in a
manner which would reasonably be expected to cause it to be disqualified in
operation. No Benefit Plan is or at any time was funded through a "welfare
benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, and no benefits under
any Benefit Plan

 



 

42  are or at any time have been provided through a voluntary employees
beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code)
or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (within the meaning of Section
501(c)(17) of the Code).

(e) No Benefit Plan has participated in, engaged in or been a party to any
transaction that is prohibited under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406
of ERISA (i) that is not exempt under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 408
of ERISA, respectively, or (ii) that could result in a material Liability to
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. With respect to any Benefit Plan, (i)
neither the Company, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had asserted against
it any material claim for taxes under Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code
and Section 5000 of the Code, or for material penalties under ERISA Sections
502(c), 502(i) or 502(l), nor, to the Companys Knowledge, is there a basis
for any such claim, and (ii) no officer, director or employee of the Company
has committed a breach of any fiduciary responsibility or obligation imposed
by Title I of ERISA that could result in a material Liability to the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate. Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no
claim or proceeding (including any audit or investigation) pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened, involving any Benefit Plan by any Person or
any Governmental Authority.

 

(f) _Schedule 3.13(f)_ sets forth a list as of the date hereof of all (i)
employment agreements or letters with officers of the Company, (ii)
agreements with consultants who are individuals obligating the Company to

reasonably likely that the Company will make, annual cash payments in an
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more, (iii) Contracts, programs
and policies of the Company under which the Company may be obligated to
provide a Worker severance or any other compensation or benefits as a result

or with respect to any Benefit Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such compensation or benefits; (iv) result in a
non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or section 4975 of the Code; (v) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part
of any outstanding loans made by the Company to any Person; or (vi) result in
the payment of any amount that would, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, not be deductible as a result of Section 280G of the Code.

provide retiree health or life insurance benefits except as may be required by
Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA or any other Applicable
Law. There has been no violation of the "continuation coverage requirement"
of "group health plans" as set forth in Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6
of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA with respect to any Benefit Plan to which
such continuation coverage requirements apply.

Regulation section 1.409A-1(a)(1).

compliance with any such Applicable Laws, Court Orders or Permits, and the
Company does not know of any existing circumstances that are likely to result
in violations of any of the foregoing.

3.15. _Permits_. _Schedule 3.15_ sets forth a complete list of all material

effect and are owned by the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances except
Permitted Encumbrances. The Company is not in material Default, nor has it
received any notice of any claim of Default, with respect to any such Permit.
Such Permits will not be adversely affected by the completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No suspension or
cancellation of any such Permits is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Governmental Authority is

Proceeding by the Company currently pending or which the Company intends to
initiate.

other confidential or proprietary information with respect to the Company,
(b) in the event that a Equityholder or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any such information,

obligation of confidentiality to Buyer or (z) was permitted to be disclosed

Authority applicable to such Party requires such Party to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information, or (ii) such access would be in
breach of any confidentiality obligation, commitment or provision by which the
Company is bound or affected, which confidentiality obligation, commitment or
provision shall be disclosed to Buyer, _provided_  that disclosure of such
obligation, commitment or provision would not itself be the breach of an
obligation or commitment to a third party. In addition, any information
obtained from the Company pursuant to the access contemplated by this 
_Section 6.2(b)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) _No Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_. No

administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the

62  period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and shall make them available to the
Equityholder Representative in connection with any audit of the Company which
could give rise to an indemnification obligation of any of the Equityholders.
Promptly following Buyers request, the Equityholder Representative shall
provide Buyer with any information that is available to it which is necessary
for the preparation of any required statement to be furnished to the
Equityholders or Tax Return to be filed by Buyer pursuant to Section 6043A of
the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder or the form prescribed by
the United States Secretary of the Treasury thereunder.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in

deemed to be Transaction Expenses. The Equityholder Representative or Buyer
(as required by Applicable Law) shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns
required to be filed in respect of any such Taxes.

(c) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Equityholder Representative shall prepare all income Tax Returns of
the Company for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that are
due before the Closing Date and shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to
Buyer for review and approval at least thirty (30) days before the due date
for filing such Tax Return. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently
with past practice.

(ii) Buyer, at its own expense (which expense, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall not be subject to indemnification by the Equityholders) shall prepare
all Tax Returns of or relating to the Company for the Straddle Period that are
due after the Closing consistently with past practice and shall provide a copy
of each such Tax Return to the Equityholder Representative at least thirty
(30) days before the due date for filing such Tax Return for the Equityholder
Representatives review and approval. With respect to Tax Returns relating to

comments made by the Equityholder Representative with respect to such Tax
Returns and such Tax Returns shall be filed as finally prepared by Buyer.

(d) _Tax Refunds_. All refunds of Taxes of the Company for any Pre-

such amounts that could have been refunded but are credited against Taxes for
a Post-Closing Tax Period in lieu of being refunded) shall be for the
Equityholders account (the "Tax Refund Amount") and shall be paid to the
Equityholder Representative for distribution to the Equityholders within five
(5) days of receipt, except to the extent such refunds were reflected as an

of the receipt by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company after the
Closing) of notice of any audit, claim, inquiry, examination or other
proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to which Buyer intends to seek
indemnification under _Article IX_ (a "Tax Claim"). The Equityholders shall
not be relieved of their indemnification obligations hereunder if such notice
is not delivered promptly except to the extent the Equityholders are
materially prejudiced thereby. The Equityholder Representative shall have the
right to control the conduct, defense and settlement or compromise of any Tax
Claim relating to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer
shall execute, or cause the Company to execute, any such powers of attorney
or other documents that may be required to give effect to the prior sentence.
If the Equityholder Representative does not elect to control the conduct of
such Tax Claim, Buyer shall have the right to control such Tax Claim,
provided, however, that Buyer shall keep the Equityholder Representative fully
informed of the progress of such Tax Claim, permit the Equityholder
Representative to participate in the conduct of the defense of such Tax
Claim and shall not settle or compromise such Tax Claim without the
Equityholder Representatives prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything
in _Article IX_ to the contrary, this _Section 7.2(e)_, and not _Section
9.4_, shall govern the conduct of Tax Claims.

7.3. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) _Offers of Employment_. No less than five (5) days prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to extend a written offer of
employment with Buyer, a Subsidiary of Buyer or the Company to each employee
set forth on _Schedule C_ ("Continuing Employees"), effective on the Closing.
Each such written offer of employment shall include (i) the same or superior
base salary or base wage rate as provided to such Company employee by the
Company as of immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) cash bonus and other
incentive compensation opportunities substantially similar in the aggregate
as those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and (iii) an
appropriate retention bonus to be paid by Buyer upon the treatment of the
first human patient with a PARP Development Compound or PARP Development
Product in a clinical study. Nothing in this subsection (a), expressed or
implied, shall confer upon any of the Continuing Employees any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement and the employment of
all the Continuing Employees shall remain "at will." Subject to Applicable
Law, prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all necessary actions to
terminate the employment of all employees of the Company, effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing, other than the Continuing Employees.
Consistent with the requirements set forth in Code Section 4980B and Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"), the Companys group health plan (or
the Buyers group health plan if the Companys plan is not continued after the
Closing) shall make COBRA continuation coverage available to each such
employee who is eligible for COBRA and was covered under the Companys group
health plan on the day prior to the employees last day of employment and each
such employees "qualified beneficiaries" (within the meaning of COBRA).

 

(b) _Benefits_. Buyer agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible
to participate in either, at the sole discretion of Buyer: (i) Buyers
employee benefit plans and programs, including any equity incentive plan,
pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, Section 401(k)
plan, bonus plan, profit sharing plan, severance plan, medical plan, dental
plan, life insurance plan, time-off programs and disability plan, in each case
to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Buyer; or (ii) such
Benefit Plans as are continued 



 

64  by the Company following the Closing Date, or are assumed by Buyer (for the
purposes of this _Section 7.3_ only, the plans referred to in clauses "(i)"
and "(ii)" of this sentence being referred to as "Specified Buyer Benefit
Plans") to the extent necessary so that Continuing Employees are offered
benefits substantially similar in the aggregate to those offered to similarly
situated employees of Buyer as of the Closing. Participation by Continuing
Employees in the Specified Buyer Benefit Plans shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of the applicable plan, and the plan sponsors right to amend
or terminate the plan for any or no reason and without notice to employees.

(c) _Eligibility; Service Credit_. From and after the Closing, each
Continuing Employee shall (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) be
credited under each Specified Buyer Benefit Plan with his or her years of
services with the Company before the Closing for purposes of vesting,
eligibility, and level of benefits (except for purposes of eligibility under
the Buyers employee stock purchase plan, benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan or where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits) to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service with the Company under any similar
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior
to the Closing. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall (to the extent that such limitation would not apply
with respect to substantially similar plans maintained by the Company prior to
the Closing) use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to
be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations,
and (ii) to the extent practicable, give effect, in determining any deductible
maximum out of pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such Continuing
Employees during the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

(d) _401(k) Plan Termination_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
reasonably necessary or appropriate pursuant to resolutions of the Companys
Board of Directors to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to
the Closing Date, any Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company
401(k) Plan"). The Company shall provide to Buyer prior to the Closing Date
written evidence of the adoption by the Companys Board of Directors of
resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(e) This _Section 7.3_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.3_,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
7.3_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 7.3_
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company in respect of continued
employment or service (or resumed employment or service) or any other matter.
Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ is intended to amend any Benefit Plan, or
interfere with Buyers, the Companys, or the Companys right from and after
the Closing to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or the employment or
provision of services by any director, employee, independent contractor or
consultant.

and the Covered Party shall cooperate with them in connection therewith;
_provided_ that the Covered Party may participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by such Covered Party and paid at its own
expense, _provided further_ that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for
the Covered Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Covered Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such
Covered Party in connection with such defense. So long as the Indemnifying
Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Covered Party
shall not pay or settle any such claim without the consent of the Equityholder
Representative with respect to claims where the Equityholders are the
Indemnifying Party and Buyer where Buyer is the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Covered Party within such twenty (20)
days, the Covered Party shall have the right to undertake, at the
Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or
settlement of the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
except with the consent of the Covered Party, enter into any settlement that
is not exclusively monetary and shall be paid entirely by the Indemnifying
Party and does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
person or persons asserting such claim to all Covered Parties of an
unconditional release from all Liability with respect to such claim or consent
to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to control any claim relating to Taxes of Buyer
or its Subsidiaries, or the Company for any Tax period ending after the
Closing Date and shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could
adversely affect the Liability of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or the Company
for Taxes for any Tax period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 



 

70 9.5. _Limitation on Indemnity; Payments Out of Milestone Payment Amounts_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article IX_ to the
contrary, no Covered Party shall be entitled to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)(1)_ of this Agreement unless
and until the aggregate of all Damages suffered by such Covered Parties and
agreed upon in accordance with _Section 9.3(b)_ hereunder exceeds $[****]
(the "Deductible Amount"), whereupon, provided the other requirements of this
_Article IX_ have been complied with, only Damages exceeding the Deductible
Amount shall become due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Deductible Amount shall apply to (i) the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in [****].

 

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, any payment made by a Person indemnifying
a Covered Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated on the
Parties Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes.

 

(c) In the event a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under this
_Article IX_ shall have been finally determined in which the indemnified
party is Buyer, (i) the amount of the related Damages (after taking into
account the limitations of _Section 9.5(a)_) shall be paid [****].

 

(d) If, following depletion or release of the Indemnification Escrow Account
to the Equityholders, an amount has been claimed by a Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (whether or not finally determined to be owed
by the Equityholders), and if the Future Payment Amounts have not yet been
fully paid pursuant to _Section 2.1_, Buyer may set-off such amounts claimed
against the Future Payment Amounts (if required to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.1_), on a dollar for dollar basis, notwithstanding any objection
by the Equityholder Representative, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.5(a)_. The exercise of such right of set-off by Buyer in good
faith, whether or not the claim is ultimately determined to be justified, will
not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Once a claim is finally determined
in accordance with this Agreement, if the Damages relating to such claim are
determined to be less than the amount set-off against the Future Payment
Amounts, Buyer shall notify the Equityholder Representative. Thereafter,
the Equityholder Representative shall prepare a Future Payment Allocation
Schedule showing the portion of such amount to be paid to each Equityholder
and deliver such Future Payment Allocation Schedule to Buyer. Within ten (10)
Business Days following Buyers receipt of such Future Payment Allocation
Schedule, Buyer shall pay to each Equityholder the portion of such amount set
forth opposite such Equityholders name on such Future Payment Allocation
Schedule in immediately available funds by check or by wire transfer to such
bank account or accounts as may be specified on such Future Payment Allocation
Schedule. [****]

 

(e) Each Equityholder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such
Equityholder shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against Buyer or the Company, or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
attorneys, Representatives, assigns or successors, for any indemnification
claims asserted by any Buyer Indemnified Parties in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which such Equityholder
may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement, it being
acknowledged and agreed that the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company and Equityholders are solely for the benefit of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties.

by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

 

71 9.6. _Remedies_. Subsequent to the Closing, the remedies in this _Article IX_
 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to any
breach of the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement,
regardless of the theory or cause of action pled, and the sole remedies of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be by means of deductions from the
Indemnification Escrow Account and Buyers right of offset set forth in
_Section 9.5(d)_ except for the remedies of specific performance, injunction
and other equitable relief; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party hereto
shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or
remedies, and the Deductible Amount or the Cap Amount shall not limit any
recovery related thereto, if and to the extent actual fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct is proven on the part of a Party by
another Party hereto or such rights, claims, causes of action or remedies may
not be waived under Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
acknowledges that its claims arising from fraud of Equityholder(s), in such
Equityholder(s)s capacity as a Stockholder, can only be brought against such
Equityholder(s) who has committed such fraud or aided and abetted such fraud.
For the purposes of this _Section 9.6_, there shall be deemed "willful
misconduct" by a Party only if such Party had actual knowledge at the time of
taking an action or omitting to take an action, that such action or omission
constituted a breach of such Partys covenants or obligations under the
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X.

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
terminating Party or Parties:

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Buyer and the Company;

(b) by either the Company or Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred by
February 28, 2010 (the "End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available
to any Party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

(c) by either the Company or Buyer if a Governmental Authority shall have
issued an Court Order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including
the failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, which
order, decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable; 

(d) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Buyer shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the



 

72  time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_
that if such inaccuracy in Buyers representations and warranties or breach by
Buyer is curable by Buyer prior to the End Date through the exercise of
reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 10.1(d)_ prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt of
written notice from the Company to Buyer of such breach (it being understood
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(d)_ if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach
by Buyer is cured so that such conditions would then be satisfied); or

(e) by Buyer, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section
8.3(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_ that
if such inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties or breach
by the Company is curable by the Company prior to the End Date through the
exercise of reasonable efforts, then Buyer may not terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 10.1(e)_ prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt
of written notice from Buyer to the Company of such breach (it being
understood that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(e)_ if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if
such breach by the Company is cured so that such conditions would then be
satisfied).

10.2. _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of
this Agreement under _Section 10.1_ above shall be effective immediately
upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating Party to the
other Party hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in  _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, except (i) as set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ this _Section 10.2_,
_Section 10.3_ and _Article XI_ , each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any Party
from Liability for any breach of this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

10.3.  _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and
expenses of financial advisors, financial sponsors, legal counsel and other
advisors, shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.

ARTICLE XI.

inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns, in accordance with the terms hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void, except that (a) Buyer may assign, 



 

73  in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any entity that is wholly-owned directly by Buyer
without the consent of the Company and (b) Buyer may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any entity that will acquire substantially all of Buyers assets
by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or otherwise. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of

11.4. _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, together
with the Confidentiality Agreement and the other documents and instruments
referred to herein and all exhibits and schedules hereto, constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and

continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.



 

75 11.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

11.6. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed or held to
be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered
divisible and inoperative as to such provision to the extent it is deemed to
be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
provision of this Agreement is deemed or held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable the Parties agree to replace such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision with a provision that is legal, valid and enforceable
that achieves the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible.
Further, should any provision contained in this Agreement ever be reformed or
rewritten by any judicial body of competent jurisdiction, such provision as so
reformed or rewritten shall be binding upon all Parties hereto.

11.7. _Schedules_. The Schedules and the Exhibits referenced in this Agreement
are a material part hereof and shall be treated as if fully incorporated into
the body of the Agreement.

11.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement, other than pursuant to _Article II_ and _Section 7.1_, will
be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement (and
their successors and assigns) any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

 

11.9. _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy
at law or equity without the necessity of demonstrating the inadequacy of
monetary damages.

11.10. _No Strict Construction_. The Parties hereto have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties hereto, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

11.11.  _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers; Consent to Service of Process_.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party hereto irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by
another party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought exclusively
in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law and, to the extent not so permitted, in any court
sitting in the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereto hereby (x)
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby,
(y) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (z) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any transaction

 



 

76  contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Any
service of process to be made in such action or proceeding may be made by
delivery of process in accordance with the notice provisions contained in
_Section 11.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable
Law. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) the defense of
sovereign immunity, (b) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section 11.11_, (c) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (d) to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

11.12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

11.13. _Release_.

 

(a) As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and for other good and sufficient
consideration, each of the Equityholders, with the intention of binding
himself, herself or itself and each of such Equityholders heirs, executors,
administrators and assigns (the " _Releasors_ "), does hereby release, acquit
and forever discharge Buyer and the Company, and each of their past and
present Affiliates, Subsidiaries, and Representatives, and all Persons acting
by, through, under, or in concert with such Persons (the " _Releasees_ "), of
and from any and all manner of action or actions, cause or causes of action,
suits, arbitrations, demands, debts, contracts, agreements,
promises, Liability, Damages, or loss of any nature whatsoever, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, fixed or contingent, direct, derivative,
vicarious or otherwise, whether based in contract, tort, or other legal,
statutory, or equitable theory of recovery, each as though fully set forth at
length herein, (hereinafter, a " _Claim_ "), which the Releasors now have or
may hereafter have against the Releasees, or any of them, by reason of any
matter, cause, act, omission or thing whatsoever in any way arising out of,
based upon, or relating to Equityholders ownership of Shares or other equity
interest in the Company; _provided, however_ , that nothing set forth in
this 



 

77   _Section 11.13_ shall (i) affect the ability of any of such Equityholder
to bring a Claim under this Agreement, (ii) release, acquit or discharge any
rights to indemnification to which any Equityholder may be entitled under the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof or under any employment agreement and/or indemnification agreement
between such Equityholder and the Company or (iii) affect the ability of any
of the Equityholders to bring a Claim with respect to any ordinary course of
employment rights or any Contracts with Buyer or the Company that remain in
effect after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted to release Buyer from any of its obligations to
the Equityholders under this Agreement.

 

(b) Each Equityholder represents and warrants to the Company and Buyer that
there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any Claim
which such Equityholder may have against any of the Releasees, and each
Equityholder agrees to indemnify and hold the Releasees harmless from any
Liability, Claims or attorneys fees or expenses incurred as a result of any
Person asserting any such assignment or transfer of any rights or Claims under
any such assignment or transfer from such party.

 

(c) Each Equityholder represents and warrants to the Company and Buyer that it
has not filed, nor has as of the date hereof, any Claims against any of the
Releasees. Each Equityholder agrees that if such Equityholder hereafter
commences, joins in, or in any manner seeks relief through any suit arising
out of, based upon, or relating to any of the Claims released hereunder, or
in any manner asserts against the Releasees any of the Claims released
hereunder, including, without limitation, through any motion to reconsider,
reopen or appeal the dismissal of the suit or action, then such Equityholder
will pay to the Releasees against whom such claim(s) is asserted all Damages
incurred by such Releasees in defending or otherwise responding to said Claim.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the release set forth in
this _Section 11.13_ shall have no force and effect until the Closing.

(e) EACH EQUITYHOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE, SHE OR IT IS FAMILIAR WITH THE
PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 

EACH EQUITYHOLDER, BEING AWARE OF SAID CODE SECTION, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHTS HE, SHE OR IT MAY HAVE THEREUNDER, AS WELL AS UNDER ANY OTHER
STATUTES OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES OF SIMILAR EFFECT.

_[remainder of page intentionally left blank]_  



 

78 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement or caused
this Agreement to be duly executed on their respective behalf, by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the day and year
first above written.

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of February  _

 _RECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of February  _
_, 2010 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ") by and among Buyer, the Company, each
of the parties listed on Schedule A thereto (each, a " _Seller_ ") and the
Representative, Buyer will purchase, and each Seller will collectively sell,
all of the capital stock of the Company and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Buyer. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement.
All interest or other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Funds or
any portion thereof (all such interest or other income, the " _Earnings_ ")
shall be retained as additional amounts in the Escrow Account (as defined
below), except as provided in _Section 3(b)_.

 

Buyer will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent an amount in
cash equal to the sums of [****] (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ")
and [****] (the " _Working Capital Escrow Amount_ ") at the Closing pursuant
to _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6_, respectively, of the Purchase Agreement,
which amounts (together with any Earnings thereon, the " _Escrow Funds_ "),
are to be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant hereto and released in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

 

SECTION 1. _Escrow Funds Subject to Agreement_. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees
to act as escrow agent subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall accept delivery of, hold and safeguard the Escrow Funds in two
escrow accounts specifically established for each of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount (respectively, the "
_Indemnification Escrow Account_ " and the " _Working Capital Escrow Account_
", and collectively, the " _Escrow Account_ ") and maintained for the purpose
outlined below pursuant to the terms hereof. 

SECTION 2. _Investment of Escrow Funds_.

 

(a) Upon written direction by the parties, the Escrow Funds shall be invested
by the Escrow Agent in Permitted Investments. The term " _Permitted
Investments_ " means the following investments so long as they have maturities
of ninety (90) days or less: (a) direct obligations of or obligations
unconditionally guaranteed by the United States or by any Person controlled
or supervised by or acting as an instrumentality of the United States or by
any Person controlled or supervised by or acting as an instrumentality of the
United States pursuant to authority granted by Congress, provided such
obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States; (b)
obligations issued or guaranteed by any state or political subdivision

1934, as amended.  thereof, in each case, rated either AAA or higher, or MIG 1 or higher, by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (" _Moody s_") or AAA or higher, or an
equivalent, by Standard and Poors Corporation (" _Standard and Poors_"), both
of New York, New York, or their successors; (c) commercial or finance paper
which is rated either Prime-1 or higher or an equivalent by Moodys or A-1 or
higher or an equivalent by Standard and Poors or their successors; and (d)
certificates of deposit, time deposits or money market deposit accounts of
banks or trust companies, organized under the Laws of the United States and
having minimum equity of $500,000,000, which certificates of deposit are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ "). The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the written certification of Buyer and
the Representative as to the characterization of the investment as a Permitted
Investment, and shall have no liability to ascertain whether or not the
investment is a Permitted Investment. In the absence of such written
directions, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in the money
market accounts of Wells Fargo that are insured by the FDIC as set forth in
_Exhibit A_. Until disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof, Earnings will be
deposited into the Escrow Account and invested with the Escrow Funds. The
Escrow Agent shall not be accountable for any losses resulting from the sale
or depreciation in the market value of such investments thereof, unless such
loss results from the Escrow Agents gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct.

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem
any Permitted Investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or
distributions required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any
investment or sale of investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any Permitted
Investment, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one
or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such affiliate is acting as
agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal for
its own account. The parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not
providing investment supervision, recommendations, or advice. 

SECTION 3. _Tax Treatment and Reporting_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that Buyer shall be treated for Tax purposes as
the owner of all amounts held in the Escrow Account unless and until such
amounts are released therefrom, in which case such amounts shall be treated
for Tax purposes as having been paid by Buyer to the party to whom such
amounts are released.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that, for Tax reporting purposes and to the
extent required by the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), Earnings in any
Tax year shall be treated as having been realized by Buyer for United States
federal income tax purposes. Unless otherwise required by law, the parties
hereto agree that, for United States federal income tax purposes, Buyer shall
report Earnings as its income and shall report related expenses as its
expense, provided that within five (5) Business Days following the end of each
calendar quarter, Escrow Agent shall release forty-five percent (45%) of the
Earnings relating to each such calendar quarter to Buyer and such Earnings
shall no longer be part of the Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent annually shall
file required information returns (if any) with the IRS and provide
payee statements to Buyer documenting such Earnings.



 

2 (c) Any disbursement of amounts in the Escrow Account to Equityholders shall
be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as consisting, in
part, of imputed interest in accordance with the Code and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. The Representative shall calculate the imputed
interest with respect to each Equityholder and provide such calculations to
the Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall then timely file information statements
with the IRS and provide payee statements to Equityholders documenting each
Equityholders share of the imputed interest or any payment made hereunder.
The Escrow Agent shall inform Buyer that the Escrow Agent filed such
information returns and provided such payee statements.

 

(d) Buyer and, on behalf of the Equityholders, the Representative agree to
provide the Escrow Agent with certified tax identification numbers by
furnishing appropriate IRS Forms W-9 and such other forms and documents that
the Escrow Agent may reasonably request to complete any information returns
and payee statements (collectively, the " _Tax Reporting Documentation_ ")
prior to any distribution to Buyer or the Equityholders. The parties hereto
understand that, in the event the Tax Reporting Documentation is not provided
to the Escrow Agent, the Code or similar state tax laws may
require withholding of a portion of any interest or other payments made to
Buyer or the Equityholders. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Buyer or the Equityholders, as appropriate,
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Escrow
Agent.

 

SECTION 4. _Working Capital Escrow Fund_. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of
a written notice from Buyer or the Representative setting forth how amounts
in the Working Capital Escrow Account are to be distributed and released,
accompanied by either (i) an executed written agreement between Buyer and the
Representative with respect to such distribution and release or (ii) a
written decision of the Neutral Arbitrator with respect to such distribution
and release, the Escrow Agent shall:

 

(a) promptly pay to Buyer from the Working Capital Escrow Account and, to the
extent the Working Capital Escrow Amount is insufficient, the Indemnification
Escrow Account, the Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount, if any; and

(b) promptly following the delivery of a Future Payment Allocation Schedule
to Buyer with respect to such release by the Representative pursuant to
Section 2.6(b) of the Purchase Agreement, release any remaining amounts in the
Working Capital Escrow Account from the Working Capital Escrow Account to
each Equityholder in accordance with such Future Payment Allocation Schedule.

SECTION 5.  _Indemnification Escrow Fund_.

(a) _Notices of Claims and Dispute Notices_.

 

(i) With respect to any indemnification claim of a Buyer Indemnified Party (a
" _Buyer Claim_ ") that Buyer reasonably believes exists, or reasonably
expects will exist, Buyer may deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice (a
" _Notice of Claim_ "), which shall set forth in reasonable detail (to the
extent known) the nature of such Buyer Claim, the amount of
Damages indemnifiable pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the "
_Indemnifiable Damages_ ") that have been paid or incurred, a good faith
estimate of the amount of Indemnifiable Damages reasonably expected to be
incurred and the provision(s) of the Stock Purchase Agreement on which the
indemnification claim is based. Buyer shall deliver a copy of the Notice of
Claim to the Representative at the same time that it delivers such Notice of
Claim to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

3 (ii) The Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer, or such Person designated by Buyer,
therefrom the amount set forth in a Notice of Claim as soon as practicable,
but no earlier than thirty-one (31) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent
of such Notice of Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if within the period
of thirty (30) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Notice of
Claim, the Escrow Agent shall have received from the Representative a written
notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") stating that the Representative disputes the
validity or the amount specified in such Notice of Claim or any portion
thereof (a " _Disputed Amount_ ") and providing in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, the Escrow Agent shall not pay any such Disputed Amount
(but shall pay any amount specified in such Notice of Claim that is not in
dispute) to Buyer, or such Person designated by Buyer, other than pursuant to
Section 3(b) of this Agreement. The Representative shall deliver a copy of
each Dispute Notice to Buyer at the same time that the Representative
delivers such Dispute Notice to the Escrow Agent.

(iii) If the Escrow Agent shall not have received a Dispute Notice with
respect to the amount specified in a Notice of Claim, or a portion thereof,
within the period of thirty (30) days following its receipt of such Notice of
Claim, the Representative and the Equityholders shall be forever barred and
precluded from contesting in any manner or forum whatsoever the distribution
of the Escrow Funds on account of such amount not so disputed (except to
dispute the delivery by Buyer of a Notice of Claim to the Representative),
and the Escrow Agent shall pay such amount to Buyer, or such Person designated
by Buyer in writing, in accordance with the preceding paragraph (ii) of this
Section 5(a).

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent may pay to Buyer, or any
Person designated by Buyer in writing, the amount set forth in a Notice of
Claim earlier than thirty-one (31) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent
of such Notice of Claim, _provided_ that the Buyer delivers to the Escrow
Agent a Notice of Claim executed by both Buyer and the Representative
authorizing the Escrow Agent to release such specified amount of the Escrow
Funds to Buyer. In the event that the Representative authorizes the Escrow
Agent to release such specified amount of the Escrow Funds by executing a
Notice of Claim with Buyer, the Representative and the Equityholders shall be
forever barred and precluded from contesting in any manner or forum whatsoever
the distribution of the Escrow Funds on account of such amount absent fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

(b) _Disputed Amounts_. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a written notice
(a " _Resolution Notice_ ") from Buyer or the Representative with respect to
a Disputed Amount specifying the amount of such Disputed Amount to which Buyer
is entitled, accompanied by either (i) an executed written agreement between
Buyer and the Representative with respect to such Disputed Amount or (ii) an
award, judgment, decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant
to Section 5(c) below, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer, or such Person
designated by Buyer, from the Indemnification Escrow Account the amount to
which Buyer is entitled, if any.



 

4 (c) _Dispute Resolution_. __ In the event of a Disputed Amount, the Buyer and
the Representative shall in good faith negotiate to settle such Disputed
Amount. If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Dispute Notice to the Escrow Agent, either party may bring suit in any
court of competent jurisdiction (subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.11 and Section 11.12 of the Purchase Agreement) with respect to
such Disputed Amount. The non-prevailing party in any such dispute shall bear
all fees, costs and expenses related to such dispute, including the
reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by the other party.

(d) _Release of the Indemnification Escrow Fund_.

(i) Promptly following the close of business on the date that is [****] (the
" _Distribution Date_ "), the Buyer will notify the Representative of the
positive difference, if any, between (A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount
plus Earnings thereon remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account and (B)
the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of the payments, if any, previously made
to Buyer, the Equityholders or the Escrow Agent out of the Escrow Funds (other
than pursuant to Section 3(b) or Section 4) in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) any amounts that the Escrow Agent is required to pay but
has not yet paid to Buyer or a Person designated by Buyer, pursuant to
Sections 5(a) or 5(b), (iii) the Withheld Amounts (as defined below)
(such positive difference, if any, the " _Initial Release Amount_ "), and
(iv) the Earnings released from the Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to
_Section 3(b)_. As soon as practicable, after the Distribution Date,
the Representative will provide a Future Payment Allocation Schedule prepared
in accordance with the Purchase Agreement showing the allocation of the
Initial Release Amount among the Equityholders. Promptly following the receipt
of such Future Payment Allocation Schedule, the Escrow Agent will release the
Initial Release Amount, if any, to the Equityholders by wire transfer or
certified check, in accordance with the Future Payment Allocation Schedule
prepared by the Representative. The term " _Withheld Amounts_ " shall mean
the aggregate amount of (x) all Disputed Amounts not paid or otherwise
resolved by such date and (y) all other amounts specified in Notices of Claims
received by the Escrow Agent as of such date and not paid as of such date
from the Escrow Funds unless, as of such date, the Escrow Agent is required to
pay such amounts pursuant to Sections 5(a) or 5(b). The amounts described in
clause (B)(ii) of this Section 5(d)(i) shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to
Buyer, or a Person designated by Buyer, pursuant to Sections 5(a) or 5(b) as
the case may be, and the amounts described in clause (B)(iii) of this Section
5(d)(i) shall remain Escrow Funds held by, and to be paid out by, the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) If, after the Distribution Date, the Escrow Agent is required to pay all
or a portion of the amounts remaining in the Escrow Account to Buyer pursuant
to Section 5(a) or 5(b), then the Escrow Agent shall make such payment to
Buyer in accordance with such Section 5(a) or 5(b). 

(iii) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent after the Distribution Date of a
Resolution Notice that any claims as to all or any portion of the Withheld
Amounts as of the Distribution Date have been resolved (" _Resolved Withheld
Amounts_ "), accompanied by (A) an executed written agreement between Buyer
and the Representative with respect to such Resolved Withheld Amounts or (B)
an award,



 

[****] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked
by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

 

5  judgment, decree or order of the arbitrator pursuant to Section 5(c) with
respect to such Withheld Amounts, the Escrow Agent shall release such Resolved
Withheld Amounts from the Escrow Account, as instructed in the joint written
notice or order, to Buyer or to the Equityholders by wire transfer or
certified check, in accordance with a Future Payment Allocation Schedule
prepared by the Representative pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, but only
to the extent the Withheld Amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Account exceed the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of Buyer Claims that the
Escrow Agent is required to pay but has not yet paid to Buyer or a
person designated by Buyer pursuant to Section 5(a) or 5(b) plus (2) all
other Withheld Amounts then remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account.

 

(iv) Any amounts paid or otherwise released to the Representative hereunder,
when made, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of the
rights of the Equityholders to receive such payments as set forth in the
Purchase Agreement and hereunder.

 

SECTION 6. _Administrative Provisions_.

 

(a) Buyer and the Representative shall have the right to inspect and obtain
copies of the records of the Escrow Agent pertaining to the Escrow Account
and to receive monthly reports of the status of the Escrow Funds. The Escrow
Agent shall send to Buyer and the Representative monthly reports detailing the
amount of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Agents possession, any release of
the Escrow Funds in the preceding month and the status of any claims pending
for the release of any of the Escrow Funds.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent may resign as escrow agent by notice to the other parties
hereto (the " _Resignation Notice_ ") effective upon appointment of a
successor Escrow Agent. If, prior to the expiration of sixty (60) Business
Days after the delivery of the Resignation Notice, the Escrow Agent shall not
have received written instructions from Buyer and the Representative
designating a banking corporation or trust company organized either under the
laws of the United States or of any state as successor escrow agent and
consented to in writing by such successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow
agent. Alternatively, if the Escrow Agent shall have received such written
instructions, it shall promptly transfer the Escrow Funds to such successor
escrow agent. Upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent and the
transfer of the Escrow Funds, and any other records, including without
limitation, tax-related information, relating to the Escrow Funds or this
Agreement by the resigning Escrow Agent to the successor escrow agent, the
duties of such resigning Escrow Agent hereunder shall terminate.

(c) Each of Buyer and the Representative hereby agrees to pay the Escrow
Agent reasonable compensation for its services hereunder in accordance with
the " _Schedule of Fees_ " attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and to reimburse the
Escrow Agent for all expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by
it in the performance of its duties hereunder and to indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from and against any and all taxes, expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees), assessments, liabilities, claims, damages, actions,
suits or other charges incurred by or assessed against it for anything done or
omitted by it in the performance of its duties hereunder, except as a result
of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Buyer and
the Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, shall share equally in
all payments owing under this Section 6(c), although liability for such
payments if not paid in a timely

 



 

6  manner shall be the responsibility of the party responsible therefore. The
Representatives portion of such payments shall be funded from the Escrow Fund
(without any requirement of any written instruction or directive from the
Representative), and Buyer agrees to execute a Notice of Claim pursuant to
Section 5(a) of this Agreement authorizing the Escrow Agent to release such
portion of the Representatives payments to the Escrow Agent. The agreement
contained in this Section 6(c) shall survive any termination of the duties of
the Escrow Agent hereunder.

 

(d) THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I)
DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER,
OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO
HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW AGENTS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF
ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE
ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

 

(e) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, including,
without limitation, a duty to review or interpret the Purchase Agreement,
except those expressly set forth herein, and no implied duties shall be read
into this Agreement. It may consult with counsel, shall be fully protected
with respect to any action taken or omitted in good faith on advice of counsel
and shall have no liability hereunder except for gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility as to the
validity, collectibility or value of the Escrow Funds or for investment losses
related thereto, provided the Escrow Funds have been invested in accordance
with Section 2 above, and it may rely on any notice, instruction, certificate,
statement, request, consent, confirmation, agreement or other instrument which
it reasonably believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
a proper person or persons. If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its
duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions from any of the
undersigned with respect to the Escrow Funds, which, in its opinion, are in
conflict with any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it shall be
entitled to refrain from taking any action until it shall be directed
otherwise in writing by the other parties hereto or by order of a court
of competent jurisdiction or the Escrow Agent may file an interpleader action
in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon the filing thereof, the
Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to the Escrow Funds and
shall be entitled to recover attorneys fees, expenses and other costs
incurred in commencing and maintaining any such interpleader action.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any other agreement
between any of the parties hereto, the Escrow Agent shall have no interest in
the Escrow Funds except as provided in this Escrow Agreement and shall hold
such funds in trust in accordance herewith.



 

7 (f) All notices, consents and other communications under this Escrow Agreement
shall be in writing and shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be deemed
to have been received when (i) delivered by hand, (ii) sent by facsimile (with
receipt confirmed), _provided_ that a copy is mailed by certified mail, return

6. Releasor agrees that Releasor will not disparage, defame or otherwise
detrimentally comment upon the Releasees, including their business practices
or products, in any manner. Releasor acknowledges that such comment shall
cause serious damage to the Company.

7\. Releasor represents and warrants that Releasor has not heretofore
assigned, transferred or purported to assign or transfer to any other person
or entity any rights, claims or causes of action herein released and
discharged, and no other person or entity has any interest in the matters
herein released and discharged. Furthermore, Releasor shall indemnify and hold
the Company and all persons or entities released herein harmless from and
against any rights, claims or causes of action which have been assigned or
transferred contrary to the foregoing representations, or in violation of the
foregoing warranties, and shall hold such persons or entities harmless from
any and all loss, expense and/or liability arising directly or indirectly out
of the breach of any of the foregoing representations or warranties.

 

8\. This Agreement is a compromise and settlement of disputed claims being
released herein, and therefore this Agreement does not constitute an
admission of liability on the part of the Company or any Releasees, or an
admission, directly or by implication, that the Company or any of the
Releasees has violated any law, rule, regulation, policy or any contractual
right or other obligation owed to any party.

9\. This Agreement may be pled as a full and complete defense and may be used
as the basis for an injunction against any action, suit, or proceeding that
may be prosecuted, instituted, or attempted by Releasor or the Company in
breach thereof.

10\. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and be deemed
governed by, the laws of the State of California, and the Company and Releasor

and that no provision contained herein shall be interpreted against any party
because that party drafted the provision.

subjects addressed in this Agreement and replaces any other prior agreements
between the parties on these subjects. This Agreement may only be modified in
a written document signed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer.



 

-4- 13\. Releasor and the Company represent and warrant that they are not relying,
and have not relied, on any representations or statements, verbal or written,
made by any other with regard to the facts involved in this controversy or
with regard to their rights or asserted rights arising out of alleged claims
or the execution and terms of this Agreement, except as provided herein.
Releasor and the Company have consulted with an attorney regarding the terms
of this Agreement and have entered into this Agreement freely, willingly and
without any coercion or duress.

 

14\. The Company and Releasor shall execute any and all further documents that
may be required to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement.

 

15\. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the Company and Releasor and to their respective representatives,
successors, heirs, agents and assigns.

16\. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and if so executed each
such counterpart shall have the force and effect of an original. Photocopies
of such signed counterparts may be used in lieu of the originals for any
purpose.

17\. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be found
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the
provision as so limited, it being intended that the parties shall receive the
benefits contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a
deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such court, the
unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity
and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.

writing. Waiver of any one breach shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
other breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.

that he/she has been given and has received and accepted authority to sign
and execute the documents on behalf of the party for whom it is indicated
