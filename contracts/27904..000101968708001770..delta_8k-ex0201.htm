ARTICLE II 

 

 

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 

SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Delta, Merger Sub, Northwest or the holders of any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Northwest
("Northwest Common Stock"):

 

 

(a) Conversion of Northwest Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.1(e) and
2.1(f), each share of Northwest Common Stock (i) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) to be issued pursuant to the
Northwest Distribution Reserve (as defined in Section 3.1(b)(i)), other than
any shares of Northwest Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.1(c), shall be automatically converted into and become the right to receive
1.25 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Delta Common Stock"), of Delta (the
"Merger Consideration"). As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Northwest Common
Stock represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c), all to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b) (or,
in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, Section 2.2(i)).

 

 

(b) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(c) Cancellation of Shares. Each share of Northwest Common Stock owned by
Delta, Merger Sub or Northwest immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be extinguished without any conversion, and no
consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

 

 

(d) Northwest Options and Stock Unit Awards. At the Effective Time, subject
to and in accordance with Section 5.11(a), all options to purchase Northwest
Common Stock and all stock appreciation rights in respect of Northwest Common
Stock (each stock option and stock appreciation right, a "Northwest Option")
and all restricted stock units and rights to receive shares of Northwest
Common Stock or an amount in cash measured by the value of a number of shares
of Northwest Common Stock (each, a "Northwest Stock Unit Award"), in each
case, issued and outstanding at the Effective Time under a Northwest Stock
Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(b)(i)), shall be assumed by Delta.

 

 

(e) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Delta Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares
of Northwest Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Delta Common Stock (after aggregating all shares of Delta Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender
of such holder's Certificate or Certificates (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required) in the manner provided in Section 2.2(i)), receive from Delta an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal
to the product of: (i) the fractional share interest (after aggregating all
shares of Delta Common Stock that would otherwise be received by such holder)
which such holder would otherwise receive, multiplied by (ii) the volume-
weighted average price of one share of Delta Common Stock, as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P., on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of
any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Delta Common Stock or
Northwest Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or other like change with respect to Delta Common Stock or Northwest Common
Stock having a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.1(f)
shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such
change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Shares and Certificates.

 

 

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Delta shall engage
Wells Fargo Shareowner Services or another institution reasonably
satisfactory to Northwest to act as exchange agent in connection with the
Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Delta
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of (i) the
holders of shares of Northwest Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the holders of claims entitled to distributions from
the Northwest Distribution Reserve, certificates representing the shares of
Delta Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (or appropriate
alternative arrangements shall be made by Delta if uncertificated shares of
Delta Common Stock will be issued). In addition, Delta shall make available
by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after
the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Northwest Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All cash and certificates representing
shares of Delta Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practical after the Effective
Time, and in any event within 5 business days after the Effective Time, Delta
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Northwest Common Stock (the
"Certificates"), which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Delta and Northwest) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for whole shares of Delta Common Stock in book-entry form, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of
Delta Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by
such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form), payment by cash or check in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Northwest Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of Northwest, the proper
number of shares of Delta Common Stock in book-entry form may be issued to a
Person (as defined in Section 8.3(p)) other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in
Section 3.1(j)) required by reason of the issuance of shares of Delta Common
Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Delta that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any
amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c)) upon
such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Delta Common Stock with a record date

Certificate with respect to the shares of Delta Common Stock represented

Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall
be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after

paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Northwest Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Northwest shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer

Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

 

 

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Delta on a daily basis,
provided, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts

investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be
paid to Delta.

 

 

(h) Withholding Rights. Delta and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Northwest Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as Delta or the Exchange
Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Delta or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 

 

(i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Delta Common
Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash for fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c); provided, however, that Delta may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement
of indemnification in a form reasonably satisfactory to Delta, or a bond in
such sum as Delta may reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that
may be made against Delta or the Exchange Agent in respect of
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

 

SECTION 3.1 Representations and Warranties of Northwest. Except as set
forth in (i) the disclosure schedule dated as of the date of this Agreement
delivered by Northwest to Delta concurrently with the execution and delivery
by Northwest of this Agreement (the "Northwest Disclosure Schedule") or (ii)
the Northwest SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(i)) filed with the
SEC (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(v)(C)) since January 1, 2007 and prior to
the date hereof (except for cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
statements contained therein), Northwest represents and warrants to Delta and
Merger Sub as set forth in this Section 3.1.

 

 

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power; Charter Documents;
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(i) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Northwest and each of its

jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or otherwise organized and has the
requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority and all necessary
government approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as currently conducted, except for those jurisdictions in which
the failure to have such power, authority or government approvals and to be
so organized, existing or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 8.3(m)) on Northwest and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Each of Northwest and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature or conduct of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Northwest and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 

(ii) Charter Documents. Northwest has delivered or made available to
Delta prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of
(A) the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Northwest

and currently in effect (the "Northwest By-Laws," and, together with the
Northwest Charter, the "Northwest Organizational Documents") and (B) the
articles or certificate of incorporation and By-Laws or like organizational
documents of each Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Section 8.3(q)) of
Northwest, as amended and currently in effect (collectively, the
"Northwest Subsidiary Organizational Documents"), and each such instrument is
in full force and effect. Northwest is not in material violation of
the Northwest Organizational Documents and no Significant Subsidiary of
Northwest is in material violation of its Northwest Subsidiary
Organizational Documents.

to have a Material Adverse Effect on Northwest and its Subsidiaries, taken as

requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.1(e), no representation or warranty is made by Northwest with
respect to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement which were not supplied by or on behalf

own, lease and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on their
respective businesses in the manner described in the Northwest SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof and as they are being conducted as of the date
hereof (the "Northwest Permits"), and all Northwest Permits are valid and in
full force and effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of,
any such Northwest Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Northwest and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(ii) Northwest and its Subsidiaries are, and have been at all times since
January 1, 2005, in compliance with the terms of the Northwest Permits and

promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by, the FAA, DOT or
any other Governmental Entity (all such laws, statutes, orders, rules,
regulations, policies, directives, guidelines, judgments, decisions and
orders, collectively, "Applicable Laws") relating to Northwest and its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets or properties, or any
applicable operating certificates, common carrier obligations, airworthiness
directives ("ADs") or Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") except where the
failure to be in compliance with the terms of the Northwest
Permits, Applicable Laws, ADs or FARs would not, individually or in the

Northwest and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since January 1, 2005,
neither Northwest nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notification from the FAA, DOT or any other Governmental Entity (A) asserting
that Northwest or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with, or at
any time since such date has failed to comply with, Applicable Laws (except
for any such lack of compliance which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Northwest and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (B) threatening to
revoke any Northwest Permit (except for any such revocation which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Northwest and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) nor, to
the Knowledge of Northwest, does any basis exist therefor. As of the date
hereof, no investigation or review by the FAA, DOT or any other Governmental

Slots (or have contractually obligated other air carriers to utilize the
Delta Slots) in a manner consistent with Applicable Laws in order to preserve

waivers or other relief granted by the DOT, FAA or other Governmental Entity.

cancellation of, with or without notice or the lapse of time or both, any

respective Subsidiaries shall, and each of Northwest and Delta shall cause
any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any

representative) ("Representatives") of it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information
or entering into any agreements, arrangements or understandings) or take any
other action designed or reasonably expected to facilitate any inquiries or
proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of
assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by
way of a tender or exchange offer) or similar transactions involving
Northwest or Delta or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, if

Person or any act thereof from the Northwest Rights Agreement (other than
Delta and Merger Sub), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an actual or proposed Alternative Transaction, or (iii) enter into
any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the

receives a bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal from a third
party (which was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in
violation of this Section 4.2(a)), subject to compliance with the other terms

Transaction Proposal and to such Person's financing sources and other Persons
or entities working in concert with it (collectively, a "Third Party"),
and participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such bona fide
written Alternative Transaction Proposal, if and only to the extent that:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-50-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) in the case of either clause (x) or (y), (A) such party\'s Stockholders
Meeting shall not have occurred, (B) such party has complied in all material
respects with this Section 4.2, and (C) the Board of Directors of Northwest
or Delta, as the case may be, determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such applicable actions
listed in clauses (x) and/or (y) would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties under Delaware law;

 

 

(ii) in the case of clause (y), (A) prior to taking such action, Northwest or
Delta, as the case may be, enters into a confidentiality agreement with the
Person who made such bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal that
is substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Northwest or Delta,
respectively, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2007,
between Northwest and Delta (the "CDA") and (B) its Board of Directors,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 8.3(s)); and

 

 

(iii) in the case of clause (x), in response to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, the Board of Directors of Northwest or Delta as applicable,
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisors) that such Alternative Transaction Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that neither party shall
be entitled to exercise its right to effect a Delta Change in Recommendation
or Northwest Change in Recommendation, as applicable, pursuant to this
Section 4.2 unless such party has: (A) provided the other party with
five business days' prior written notice (such notice, a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising the other party that its Board of Directors
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by its Board of Directors and the identity of the person
making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of any
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a
new three business day period), (B) provided to other party all material
information delivered or made available to the person or group of persons
making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal, (C)
during such five business day period (or three business day period in the
case of an amendment), if requested by the other party, engaged in good faith
negotiations with the other party to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that any Alternative Transaction Proposal which was determined to constitute
a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (D) at the end of
such five business day period (or three business day period in the case of an
amendment), such Alternative Transaction Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party
following a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations
required by clause (C) or otherwise).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-51-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, Northwest shall notify Delta and Delta shall
notify Northwest, as the case may be, promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Transaction Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information relating to Northwest or Delta,
respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal. Such notice to Northwest or Delta, as the
case may be, shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the
identity of the Person making the Alternative Transaction Proposal or such
request and the material terms of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal
or request or any material modification or material amendment to an
Alternative Transaction Proposal. From the date hereof until the earlier of

modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
indication or request. Northwest shall also promptly, and in any event within
24 hours, notify Delta, and Delta shall also promptly, and in any event
within 24 hours, notify Northwest, orally and in writing, if it enters into
discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Transaction Proposal
in accordance with Section 4.2(a).

 

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 shall prohibit Northwest or Delta
or their respective Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to their
respective stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance with
such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action
taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement,
including Sections 7.1(e) and (f), as applicable.

 

 

(d) Northwest and its Subsidiaries, and Delta and its Subsidiaries,
respectively, shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Northwest or Delta,
respectively) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Northwest
or Delta who have been furnished confidential information regarding Northwest
or Delta in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Alternative Transaction Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date
hereof promptly to return or destroy such information, as permitted under any
agreements relating to the disclosure of such information. Northwest and
Delta agree not to, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries not to,

any agreement to which Northwest or Delta or their respective Subsidiaries is
or may become a party.

accountant or other retained representative) of Northwest or its
Subsidiaries, or Delta or its Subsidiaries, respectively, at the direction or
with the consent of Northwest or Delta, respectively, or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 4.2 by Northwest or Delta, respectively.

 

 

(f) Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall (x) permit either party to terminate
this Agreement (except to the extent specifically set forth in Sections
7.1(c) or (d), as applicable) or (y) affect any other obligations of the
parties under this Agreement, including the obligations set forth in

review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed written (or any proposed oral)
communication with any such Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C) not
participate in any meeting or oral communication with any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, (D) furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof, including summaries of any meetings or
communications the other is not permitted to participate in pursuant to
clause (C) above) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (E) furnish the other with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such
Governmental Entity. Each of Delta and Northwest may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 5.3 as "outside counsel only." Such
competitively sensitive material and the information contained therein shall
be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Delta or Northwest, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

 

 

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Delta and
Northwest shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) In connection with the filings and activities referenced in Sections
5.3(a) and (b), the parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals,
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, and authorizations of all
Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, and authorizations
of all such third parties or Governmental Entities. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of Delta and Northwest agrees to take any action, or commit
to take any action (including with respect to selling, holding separate or
otherwise disposing of any business or assets), or agree to any condition or
restriction, (collectively, the "Regulatory Actions") required or necessary
to obtain, prior to the commencement of any litigation by the Department of
Justice seeking to enjoin the Merger (unless a proposed final judgment is
filed by the Department of Justice contemporaneously with commencement of
such litigation) (or in the case of any actions contemplated by the last
sentence of Section 5.3(e), in an expeditious manner and as promptly as
practicable), any of the foregoing permits, consents, approvals, expirations
or terminations of waiting periods, and authorizations of Governmental
Entities; provided, that neither Delta nor Northwest shall have any
obligations to agree to, and neither shall take, any of the foregoing
Regulatory Actions that (i) would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on (x) Delta and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y)
Northwest and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (z) Delta and its
Subsidiaries (including Northwest and its Subsidiaries) after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole or (ii) is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

 

 

(e) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to "substantially
comply" as promptly as practicable with any request for additional
information or documentary material issued by a Governmental Entity under 15
U.S.C. Sect. 18a(e) and in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (a "Second Request"). Each party will certify substantial
compliance with respect thereto as promptly as practicable, but in no event
more than three months after the date of the Second Request. Each party
agrees to take all steps to assert, defend, and support certification of
substantial compliance with any Second Request. Neither party shall take any
action to extend or toll the waiting period requirements of the HSR Act
or provide the Department of Justice any additional time to consider,
investigate or review the transaction prior to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to a date beyond
October 31, 2008, without the consent of the other party (in the case of
any extension or tolling to a date certain beyond October 31, 2008, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Each party
agrees to give such advance notices as may be required (including,
if necessary, notice of an anticipated closing date), and to otherwise
reasonably cooperate, to give effect to the rights of the other party set
forth in the foregoing sentence. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the covenants of the parties in Sections 5.3(a), (b), and (d), in the
event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted
by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) each of Delta and
Northwest shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement so as to permit such consummation as promptly as practicable, and
in any event by the fifth business day before the Outside Date, and (ii) each
of Delta and Northwest shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
defend, at its cost and expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or
administrative, against it or its Affiliates in connection with the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-57-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) As part of his responsibilities as co-Chairman of the transition
committee described in Section 5.18, the current Chief Executive Officer of
Northwest will have the lead role in devising the strategy of the parties
with respect to seeking any actions, consents and approvals of any
Governmental Entities with respect to the Merger and coordinating other
contacts with Governmental Entities and their staff. These activities shall
include, without limitation, responsibility for (i) overseeing the drafting
of the material content of submissions and other communications with
Governmental Entities, (ii) selecting who will lead presentations and
proceedings and (iii) coordinating activities of the parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION 5.4 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Delta shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the then present and
former officers and directors of Northwest and its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") for any costs, expenses, judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any claim, action, investigation, suit or
proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) based
in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that
such Person is or was an officer, director or employee of Northwest or any of
its Subsidiaries and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any
acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including
those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby),
and shall advance expenses in respect thereof, in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Laws and, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Laws, to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by Northwest and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Northwest Organizational Documents (or
equivalent organizational documents of any of any Subsidiaries of Northwest)
and, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, indemnification
agreements in existence on the date hereof with any directors and officers
Northwest and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation and other limitations on liability existing
in favor of the directors, officers and employees of Northwest as provided in
the Northwest Organizational Documents or in any indemnification agreements
between Northwest and any directors, officers and employees, shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, and shall be honored by Delta and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying
party thereunder, without any amendment thereto.

 

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors' and officers' and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by Northwest with respect to claims arising
from facts or events which occurred on or before the Effective Time
(including those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby); provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor,
from insurance carriers with the same or higher financial strength ratings as
Northwest's current directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
insurance carriers, policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to officers,
directors and fiduciaries of Northwest with respect to claims arising from
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including
those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby);
and provided, further, that if the annual premiums for such policies at any
time during such period will exceed 250% of the per annum premium rate paid
by Northwest and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for such policies,
then Delta shall be required to provide the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium of 250% of such annual premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Northwest may, after prior consultations with Delta, purchase six-year "tail"
prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors' and
officers' and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Northwest;
provided, that the amount paid by Northwest shall not be in excess of 250% of
the per annum premium rate paid by Northwest as of the date hereof for such
policies. If such "tail" prepaid policies have been obtained by Northwest
prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Delta shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and
effect, for their full terms, and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, and all other obligations under this Section 5.4(b)
shall terminate.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-58-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which an indemnified person may
incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this
Section 5.4.

 

 

(d) If Delta, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Delta shall take
such action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the
applicable obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

 

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise, including indemnification agreements
Northwest has entered into with any of its directors or officers.

 

 

SECTION 5.5 Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth in this Section 5.5 and
in Section 7.2, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, except that each of Northwest and Delta shall bear and pay
one-half of the costs and expenses incurred by Delta, Merger Sub or Northwest
(other than attorneys' fees, accountants' fees and related expenses) in
connection with (i) the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4
(including financial statements and exhibits), the Joint Proxy Statement
(including SEC filing fees) and any preliminary materials related thereto and
(ii) the filings of the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR
Act and any applicable antitrust, competition or similar laws of any foreign
jurisdiction (including filing fees).

 

 

SECTION 5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the content of
which shall be agreed upon by both Delta and Northwest. Neither Northwest nor
Delta shall issue any press release or make any other public statement with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without prior
consultation with the other party; provided, however, that either party may
issue a press release or make such other public statement to the extent
required by Applicable Law or by the rules and regulations of the NYSE
without such prior consultation to the extent it is impracticable under
the circumstances. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts (i)
to develop a joint communications plan and (ii) to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan
and the regulatory strategy contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall
provide the other party with its stockholder lists and allow and facilitate
the other party's contact with its stockholders and respective investors and
following a Delta Change in Recommendation or a Northwest Change in
Recommendation, as the case may be, such contact may be made without regard
to the limitation set forth in this Section 5.6.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-59-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 5.7 Listing. Delta shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Delta Common Stock issuable under Article II, and those shares of Delta
Common Stock required to be reserved for issuance in connection with the
Merger, including shares of Delta Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of any Northwest Options or Northwest Stock Unit
Awards, to be authorized for listing on the NYSE, upon official notice
of issuance.

 

 

SECTION 5.8 Reorganization Treatment. Each of Delta and Northwest shall,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Delta, Merger Sub nor
Northwest shall take any action, cause or permit any action to be taken, or
fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

SECTION 5.9 Section 382(l)(5) of the Code. Both Delta and Northwest will
make a timely election under Section 382(l)(5)(H) of the Code not to have the
provisions of Section 382(l)(5) of the Code apply to the ownership changes
occurring pursuant to the Northwest Plan of Reorganization and the Delta Plan
of Reorganization, as applicable.

 

 

SECTION 5.10 Conveyance Taxes. Northwest and Delta shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION 5.11 Equity Awards and Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) Equity Awards.

 

 

(i) Northwest Options. At the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Northwest Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective
Time, will be assumed by Delta. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms
of the applicable Northwest Stock Plan and award agreement, each Northwest
Option so assumed by Delta under this Agreement will otherwise continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Northwest Stock Plan (including any applicable award agreement or
other document evidencing such Northwest Option) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase
rights, but taking into account any acceleration of Northwest Options
pursuant to any Northwest Stock Plan or applicable award agreement), except
that (A) each Northwest Option, when exercisable, will be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Delta Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Northwest Common Stock that were subject to such
Northwest Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Delta
Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Delta
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Northwest Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Northwest Common Stock of such Northwest Option by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-60-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Northwest Stock Unit Awards. Subject to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the applicable Northwest Stock Plan and any applicable award or
other agreement, each Northwest Stock Unit Award shall be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the number of shares of Delta Common
Stock (or an amount in respect thereof for cash-settled Northwest Stock Unit
Awards) equal to the number of shares of Northwest Common Stock subject to
the Northwest Stock Unit Award, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Delta Common Stock).

 

 

(iii) Northwest and Delta agree that prior to the Effective Time, Northwest
shall, and shall be permitted under this Agreement to, take all corporate
action necessary, including, but not limited to, amending any Northwest
Option, Northwest Stock Unit Award or Northwest equity award agreement
evidencing such award, or Northwest Stock Plan, (A) to effectuate the
provisions of Section 5.11(a)(i) and Section 5.11(a)(ii) and (B) to the
extent applicable, to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of options,
restricted stock units or other awards thereunder on or after the date
hereof. From and after the Effective Time, unless Delta determines otherwise,
all references to Northwest (other than any references relating to a "change
in control" of Northwest) in each Northwest Stock Plan and in each agreement
evidencing any Northwest Options or Northwest Stock Unit Awards shall be
deemed (A) for all purposes relating to employment, consultancy or
directorship (or words of similar meaning) to refer to Delta and its
Subsidiaries and (B) for all other purposes, to refer to Delta. The parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the conversion of any
Northwest Options which (i) are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) provided for in Section 5.11(a)(i) shall
be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and (ii)
shall be effected in a manner intended to avoid the imposition of taxes under
Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

(iv) Within five business days following the Closing Date, Delta shall
register the shares of Delta Common Stock subject to Northwest Options and
Northwest Stock Unit Awards by filing an effective registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form, and Delta shall
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements with respect thereto for so long as such awards
remain outstanding. Following the Closing Date, Delta may grant
equity awards under the Northwest Stock Plans to Northwest Employees who
continue employment with Delta or the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, to the extent shares are available
for grant under any such plan, in accordance with the mergers and
acquisitions exemption to the equity compensation plan shareholder approval
requirement under the NYSE rules.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-61-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Delta shall not be required to take any of
the actions contemplated by this Section 5.11(a) if, and to the extent that,
such action does not comply with the Applicable Law of any foreign
jurisdiction, and the parties shall agree in good faith prior to
the Effective Time on an alternative that is intended to be reasonably
comparable, or to take such other action in respect thereof that the parties
agree in good faith to be appropriate.

 

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Delta Benefit Plans and the
Northwest Benefit Plans in effect as of the Effective Time shall remain in
effect with respect to employees and former employees of Delta or Northwest
and their Subsidiaries (the "Surviving Corporation Employees"),
respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time, until such time as
the Surviving Corporation shall otherwise determine, subject to applicable
laws and the terms of such plans. During any period from and after the
Effective Time in which a Northwest Benefit Plan listed on Section
5.11(b) of the Northwest Disclosure Schedule is maintained at Northwest or at
any Subsidiary of Delta, Delta shall honor and perform, or cause Northwest
(or such Subsidiary of Delta) to honor and perform such Northwest Benefit
Plans in accordance with its terms as in effect from time to time.
Without limiting the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit any
amendment, modification or termination of any Delta Benefit Plans or the
Northwest Benefit Plans from and after the Effective Time to the extent
allowed under the terms of any such plans, including but not limited to any
such action that may be (i) required by applicable laws (including any
applicable qualification requirements of Sections 401(a) of the Code and as
necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code),
(ii) necessary as a technical matter to reflect the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) required for Delta or the Surviving Corporation to provide for
or permit investment in its securities, or (iv) required for Delta or the
Surviving Corporation to comply with any Delta CBA or Northwest CBA.

 

 

(c) With respect to any benefit plans in which any Surviving Corporation
Employees who are employees of Delta or Northwest (or their subsidiaries)
prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time, and in which such Surviving Corporation Employees did not
participate prior to the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), except with
respect to Represented Employees (as defined in Section 5.12), the Surviving
Corporation shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Surviving Corporation Employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Delta Benefit Plan or Northwest Benefit Plan, as the case may be
and (ii) recognize all service of the Surviving Corporation Employees with
Delta and Northwest, and their respective affiliates and predecessors, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to
benefits and levels of benefits in any New Plan in which such employees may
be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent such
service is taken into account under the applicable New Plan, except to the
extent that such crediting would result in the duplication of benefits and
provided, that no prior service shall be recognized for purposes of
determining eligibility or level of benefits under the Delta monthly survivor
welfare benefits plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-62-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision
of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period
of time for, or preclude the ability of either party to terminate, any
Surviving Corporation Employee for any reason or (ii) require the Surviving
Corporation to continue any Delta Benefit Plan or Northwest Benefit Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time to the extent permitted by their terms and Applicable Laws.

 

 

(e) Each of Northwest and Delta agrees that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the
other party, it will not and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for hire or hire any director-level or more senior
employee of the other party or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the
foregoing provision will not prohibit such party from (a) hiring any such
person who has not been employed by the other party during the preceding six
months or (b) making any general public solicitation not designed
to circumvent these provisions.

 

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.11 and Section 5.12 are for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to
any Delta Benefit Plan or Northwest Benefit Plan or any other compensation
and benefits plans maintained for or provided to employees, directors or
consultants of Delta or Northwest prior to or following the Effective Time or
(ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt
any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of
Northwest or Delta or any of their respective subsidiaries or, following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other
than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.11 and Section
5.12) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 5.12 Honoring of Collective Bargaining Agreements; Represented
Employees. With respect to any continuing employee whose terms and conditions
of employment are governed by any of the Delta CBAs or Northwest CBAs (each,
a "Represented Employee"), Delta and Northwest shall honor or cause to be
honored, in conformity with Applicable Law, each such Delta CBA or Northwest
CBA, as they currently exist or as they are modified, through the expiration
or termination of such agreements in conformity with Applicable Law,
including the termination of any such agreement as a result of the
extinguishment of the representation status or certification of any
applicable labor organization. Delta and Northwest shall make all
notifications to and communications to and with any labor organization
representing their respective employees as may be required by Applicable Law
or any CBA, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-63-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 5.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Delta shall give prompt
notice to Northwest and Northwest shall give prompt notice to Delta, as the
case may be, of any Effect, individually or in the aggregate with any other
Effects, having, or which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on such party and its Subsidiaries or which would
reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Article VI to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.13 will not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or
the conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

 

 

SECTION 5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Delta
and Northwest shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all such steps
as may be required (to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws) to cause
any dispositions of Northwest Common Stock (including derivative securities)
or acquisitions of Delta Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Delta Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Northwest
as a result of being a director or officer thereof to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 

SECTION 5.15 State Takeover Laws. Prior to the Effective Time, neither
Northwest nor Delta shall take any action to render inapplicable, or to
exempt any third Person from, or consent to a transfer under, any state
takeover law or state law, or any provision of the Northwest Organizational
Documents or the Delta Organizational Documents, as the case may be, that
purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to
transfer, acquire, hold or vote shares of capital stock, unless required to
do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable Northwest
Organizational Document or Delta Organizational Document.

 

 

SECTION 5.16 Reservation of Delta Common Stock; Northwest Distribution
Reserve. Effective at or prior to the Effective Time, Delta shall reserve
(free from preemptive rights) out of its reserved but unissued or treasury
shares of Delta Common Stock, for the purposes of effecting the conversion of
the issued and outstanding shares of Northwest Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, sufficient shares of Delta Common Stock to provide for such
conversion as well as the issuance of Delta Common Stock upon the exercise or
settlement of Northwest Options and Northwest Stock Unit Awards assumed by
Delta under Section 5.11 and in satisfaction of any obligations with respect
to the Northwest Distribution Reserve. From and after the Effective Time,
Delta shall honor and cause to be honored any remaining obligations of
Northwest to issue securities under the Northwest Plan of Reorganization in
respect of the Northwest Distribution Reserve.

 

 

SECTION 5.17 Seniority Protection. For all Delta and Northwest employees
who are members of a craft or class that is subject to the Railway Labor Act
(other than any craft or class where the same labor organization represents
the employees at Delta and Northwest), binding seniority integration
procedures governed by the provisions of sections 3 and 13 of the labor
protective provisions required by the Civil Aeronautics Board in connection
with the Allegheny-Mohawk merger shall apply, which provisions are set out as
follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-64-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) Insofar as the Merger affects the seniority rights of either Delta or
Northwest employees, provisions shall be made for the integration of
seniority lists in a fair and equitable manner, including, where applicable,
agreement through collective bargaining between the carriers and the
representatives of the Delta or Northwest employees affected. In the event of
failure to agree, the dispute may be submitted by either party for adjustment
in accordance with section 13 of such labor protection provisions.

 

 

(b) In the event that any dispute or controversy arises with respect to the
protections provided above in Section 5.17(a), which cannot be settled by
the parties within 20 days after the controversy arises, it may be referred
by any party to an arbitrator selected from a panel of seven names furnished
by the NMB for consideration and determination. The parties shall select the
arbitrator from such panel by alternatively striking names until only one
remains, with such chosen individual serving as arbitrator. Expedited
hearings and decisions will be expected, and a decision shall be rendered
within 90 days after the controversy arises, unless an extension of time is
mutually agreeable to all parties. The salary and expenses of the arbitrator
shall be borne equally by the carrier and (i) the organization or
organizations representing the employee or employees, or (ii) if
unrepresented, the employee or employees or group or groups of employees. The
decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties.

 

 

(c) The above provisions of Section 5.17(b) shall not apply if the parties
by mutual agreement determine that an alternative method for dispute
settlement or an alternative procedure for selection of an arbitrator is
appropriate in their particular dispute. No party shall be excused from
complying with the conditions set forth in Section 5.17(b) by reason of
having suggested an alternative method or procedure, unless and until that
alternative method or procedure shall have been agreed to by all the parties.

 

 

SECTION 5.18 Transition. In order to facilitate the integration of the
operations of Delta and Northwest and their respective Subsidiaries and to
permit the coordination of their related operations on a timely basis, and in
an effort to accelerate to the earliest time practicable following the
Effective Time the realization of synergies, operating efficiencies and other

SECTION 8.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County Delaware in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle
County Delaware. Each party hereto further irrevocably consents to
the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such
suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail to
such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of
process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered
mail; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.10 shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The
consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.10 shall not constitute a
general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 8.10. The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 

 

SECTION 8.11 Headings, etc. The headings and table of contents contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without preventing the parties from realizing the major portion
of the economic benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Laws in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

 

SECTION 8.13 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of,
or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. Except as set
forth herein, all rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

 

 

SECTION 8.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF DELTA, MERGER SUB AND NORTHWEST
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF DELTA, MERGER SUB OR NORTHWEST IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

SECTION 8.15 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware in and for New Castle County Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
