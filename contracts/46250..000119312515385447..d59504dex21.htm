II. CLOSING; POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT.

 

2.1 _Purchase of Shares and Cancellation of Options_. On the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, (i) the
Stockholders shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from the
Stockholders, all of the Stockholders right, title and interest in and to
all of the Shares owned by such Stockholders, free and clear of all Liens,
(ii) the Optionholders shall surrender the Options for cancellation pursuant

Common Stock shall be cancelled and terminated and become null, void and of no

terminated and of no further force or effect. The aggregate amount payable to

account or accounts designated by such Optionholder in accordance with the
Companys standard payroll process. Before the Closing Date, the board
of directors of the Company will adopt resolutions authorizing cancellation
of the Options and the Companys 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended from
time to time, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") will take place by electronic communication on the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties set forth in _Article VIII_ (provided that the
Closing may not occur before December 23, 2015), or on such other date and at
such other place as agreed to by the Purchaser and the Stockholders
Representative, and shall be effective as of 11:59 p.m. EST on such date. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

 



-2- 2.3 _Estimated Transaction Consideration; Allocation_.

 

2.3.1 At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser a certificate executed by the Companys chief
financial officer setting forth a good faith estimate of the amount of the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital, and the Closing Company
Cash (the "Closing Certificate"). As used herein, "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness," "Estimated Closing Working Capital," and "Estimated Closing
Company Cash" mean the estimates of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Working Capital, and the Closing Company Cash, respectively, as set forth in
the Closing Certificate. "Estimated Transaction Consideration" shall mean an
amount equal to the Transaction Consideration, assuming for purposes of such
calculation, the Closing Indebtedness is equal to the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, and the Estimated Closing Company Cash is equal to the
Closing Company Cash. The Closing Certificate shall (a) be prepared as of
11:59 p.m. EST on the Closing Date, in accordance with GAAP and, except where
inconsistent with GAAP, shall use the same accounting principles and practices
the Company used to prepare the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2014, (b) be derived from the books and records (including the general
ledgers) of the Company, and (c) properly reflect such books and records
(including the general ledgers). _Schedule 2.3_ contains a sample calculation
of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and Closing Company Cash as
if the Closing Date were September 30, 2015.

 

2.3.2 At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing and concurrently
with the delivery of the Closing Certificate, the Stockholders
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a certificate (the
"Allocation Certificate") that shall set forth, as of the Closing Date, the
following: (a) the name of each Stockholder, the number of Shares held by
each Stockholder and the portion of the Estimated Transaction Consideration
payable to each such Stockholder; and (b) the name of each Optionholder, the
number of shares subject to Options held by such Optionholder and the related
exercise price, and the portion of the Estimated Transaction Consideration
payable to each Optionholder. The parties agree that the Purchaser shall be
entitled to rely on the Allocation Certificate in making payments under
_Article II_  and the Purchaser shall not be responsible for the calculations
or the determinations regarding such calculations in such Allocation
Certificate.

 

2.4 _Closing Payments_.

 

2.4.1 At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Estimated Transaction
Consideration as follows (the "Closing Payments"):

(a) the Escrow Amount deposited by wire transfer of immediately available
funds into the Escrow Account established pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement;

(b) the Working Capital Escrow Amount deposited by wire transfer
of immediately available funds into the Working Capital Escrow Account
established pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

(c) the Holdback Amount deposited by wire transfer of immediately available
funds into an account or accounts designated by the Stockholders
Representative prior to Closing;

 

(d) the aggregate dollar amount to satisfy any Indebtedness to be paid at the
Closing (the "Closing Indebtedness Payments") to the applicable lenders
identified in, and in accordance with, the pay-off letters provided by the
Company to the Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing;

 



-3- (e) the aggregate dollar amount to satisfy any Selling Expenses that remain
unpaid at Closing to the Persons entitled thereto in accordance with invoices
from such Persons provided by the Company to the Purchaser at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing;

 

(f) to the Company, for distribution to the Optionholders (or, with respect to
the amount described in clause (ii) below, for payment by the Company in
accordance with its obligations described in clause (ii)), in accordance with
the Companys payroll practices and applicable withholding, (i) the aggregate
amount (subject to applicable withholding Tax) set forth opposite each
Optionholders name on the Allocation Certificate upon execution of an Option
Cancellation Agreement by such Optionholder, plus (ii) an amount equal to the
Companys payroll tax and benefit plan obligations with respect to
the amounts to be paid to the Optionholders; and

(g) the balance of the Estimated Transaction Consideration, after taking into
account the payments set forth in clauses (a) through (f) of this _Section
2.4.1_, to the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the
Stockholders in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing to the Purchaser by the Stockholders
Representative at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

2.5  _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

2.5.1 _Adjustment Statement Preparation_. As soon as practicable, but in any
event not more than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative an
adjustment statement setting forth the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Working Capital, and the Closing Company Cash, in each case, as of
the Closing and, based on the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working
Capital, and the Closing Company Cash as derived therefrom, the Purchasers
written calculation of the Transaction Consideration, and the adjustment (if
any) necessary to reconcile the Estimated Transaction Consideration to the
Transaction Consideration (the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement"). The
Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be prepared as of 11:59 p.m. EST on
the Closing Date, in accordance with GAAP, and, except where inconsistent with
GAAP, shall use the same accounting principles and practices as the Company
used to prepare the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, and
in accordance with the definitions of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working
Capital, and Closing Company Cash as defined in this Agreement. For purposes
of complying with the terms set forth in this  _Section 2.5_, each Party
shall cooperate with and make available to the other Parties, their respective
representatives, and the Accounting Referee, all information, records, data
and working papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel,
as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis
of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the resolution of any disputes
thereunder.

 

2.5.2 _Adjustment Statement Review_. If the Stockholders Representative
reasonably believes that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement is inaccurate
or was not properly prepared in accordance with _Section 2.5.1_, the
Stockholders Representative shall so notify the Purchaser no later than
thirty (30) days after the Stockholders Representatives receipt thereof
(the "Notice of Disagreement"), setting forth in the Notice of Disagreement
its objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement with particularity and
the specific changes which the Stockholders Representative proposes to be
made in order to conform the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to the terms of
_Section 2.5.1_.

 

2.5.3 _Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution_. If the Stockholders
Representative timely notifies the Purchaser of an objection by the
Stockholders Representative to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement in
accordance with _Section 2.5.2_, and if the Stockholders Representative and
the Purchaser are unable to resolve such dispute through good
faith negotiations within fifteen (15) days after the Stockholders
Representatives delivery of such Notice of Disagreement, then either the
Stockholders Representative and the Purchaser may require that the
Stockholders Representative and the Purchaser

 



-4-  mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be finally
resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by,
PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if such firm declines the representation, a
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by the Stockholders
Representative and the Purchaser (the accounting firm ultimately chosen, the
"Accounting Referee"). The Stockholders Representative and Purchaser will
cooperate with the Accounting Referee in good faith and in all reasonable
respects as may be requested by the Accounting Referee, including providing
the Accounting Referee reasonable access during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice to any relevant personnel, properties, and books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Stockholders Representative
and Purchaser will cause the Accounting Referee to limit its review
and determination to those items set forth on the Notice of Disagreement that
remain in dispute and that relate to accounting matters, and to deliver a
written report containing its calculations of each such disputed item. The
final determination of the Accounting Referee will be made in strict
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the definitions of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Cash and Closing Indebtedness). The
Accounting Referee will determine the items in dispute solely based on
written submissions made by the Stockholders Representative and Purchaser
(and their respective representatives) consistent with the terms hereof (and
not by independent review). The Accounting Referee shall determine and report
in writing to the Stockholders Representative and the Purchaser as to the
resolution of all disputed matters and the effect of such determinations on
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement within thirty (30) days after
such submission or such longer period as the Accounting Referee may
reasonably require, and such determinations shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties, absent manifest error, and upon which a judgment
may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. None of the
Stockholders Representative, Purchaser, or their respective representatives
will have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Accounting Referee
concerning the subject matter hereof without the prior written consent of the
other Party. The Accounting Referee will not assign a value to any disputed
item that is greater than the greater value for such disputed item claimed by
either Party in its written submission or less than the lesser value for
such item claimed by either Party in its written submission. The fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the
Stockholders Representative, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other
hand) that assigned amounts to items in dispute that were, on a net basis,
furthest in amount from the amount finally determined by the Accounting
Referee (or equally in the event the Parties assigned amounts were, on a net
basis, equally far from the amount finally determined by the Accounting
Referee).

2.5.4 _Final Adjustment Statement_. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement
shall become the "Final Adjustment Statement" and as such shall become final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties for all purposes of this Agreement and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
upon the earliest to occur of the following:

(a) the mutual acceptance by the Stockholders Representative and the
Purchaser of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, with such changes thereto,
if any, as may be proposed by the Stockholders Representative and consented
to by the Purchaser;

 

(b) the expiration of thirty (30) days after the Stockholders Representative
receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, without timely written
objection by the Stockholders Representative in accordance with _Section
2.5.2_; or

(c) the delivery to the Stockholders Representative and the Purchaser by the
Accounting Referee of the final report of its determination of all disputed
matters submitted to the Accounting Referee pursuant to _Section 2.5.3_.

 

2.5.5 _Adjustment of Transaction Consideration_. If the Transaction
Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with this  _Section 2.5_,
is greater than the Estimated Transaction Consideration, the Purchaser shall
pay the amount of such difference to the Stockholders Representative,

 



-5-  for the benefit of the Stockholders and the Optionholders, in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing to
the Purchaser by the Stockholders Representative. If the Transaction
Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.5_,
is less than the Estimated Transaction Consideration, then the Parties shall
direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Purchaser from the Working
Capital Escrow Amount an amount equal to such deficiency and, if the amount by
which the Transaction Consideration is less than the Estimated Transaction
Consideration exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the Stockholders
shall have several, but not joint, liability to pay such excess amount to
Purchaser. Any such amount shall be due and payable no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Preliminary Adjustment Statement becomes the
Final Adjustment Statement. For tax purposes, any payment by the Purchaser or
the Stockholders under this _Section 2.5_ shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Transaction Consideration.

 

2.6 _Allocation of the Transaction Consideration_. The payment by the
Purchaser of the Transaction Consideration (including any additional amount
required pursuant to _Section 2.5_) into an account designated by the
Stockholders Representative shall constitute payment by the Purchaser to the
Stockholders and the Optionholders, as applicable, in full and
final satisfaction of the Purchasers obligation to pay such amount
hereunder.

2.7 _Insurance Policy_. The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to procure
an insurance policy reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and consistent with
transactions of this type with respect to the representations and warranties
of the Company and the Stockholders in this Agreement and with minimum limits
of no less than $15,700,000 (the "RandW Policy") within 20 days of the date of
this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly deliver a copy of the procured RandW
Policy to the Company, and at Closing, the Purchaser shall bind the RandW
Policy and all costs and expenses and other amounts incurred in connection
with such RandW Policy, whether incurred prior to or after the Closing, shall be
paid by the Purchaser. By way of example (and not as a limitation), the
parties agree that the coverage described in that certain Non-Binding
Indication Letter from AIG Mergers and Acquisitions Insurance Group dated
November 10, 2015 previously delivered to the Company by Purchaser is
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Purchaser uses its best efforts but is ultimately unable to obtain
the RandW Policy within 20 days of the date of this Agreement or thereafter, the
Indemnity Flip set forth in  _Section 9.2.3(d)_ shall be deemed to
automatically occur.

2.8 _Holdback Amount_. The Holdback Amount shall be held by the Stockholders
Representative and shall be available to pay (i) the amount of any adjustment
owing to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.5.5_ in excess of the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, (ii) the amount of any Damages, including Taxes,
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period for calendar year 2015 and to the Tax
Returns set forth on _Schedule 3.6_ in an amount of up to $200,000, (iii) any
Damages which the Stockholders Representative has agreed are owing to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party, and (iv) post-Closing expenses of the
Stockholders Representative relating to this Agreement. Any portion of the
Holdback Amount not used to pay such amounts shall be distributed at such
time, as determined by the Stockholders Representative in its sole
discretion, to the Stockholders and Optionholders proportionately (in
accordance with the proportion of the Transaction Consideration allocated to
such Stockholder and Optionholder pursuant to the Allocation Certificate);
provided that the Stockholders Representative shall retain and not distribute
to the Stockholders and Optionholders at least $200,000 of the Holdback Amount
until the Tax Returns set forth on  _Schedule 3.6_ and the Tax Returns
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period for calendar year 2015 are filed with
the applicable Governmental Authorities.

 

2.9 _Proceedings_. Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, all
proceedings that will be taken and all documents that will be executed and
delivered by the Parties on the Closing Date will be deemed to have been taken
and executed simultaneously, and no proceedings will be deemed taken nor any
document executed and delivered until all such proceedings have been
taken, and all such documents have been executed and delivered.

 



-6- 2.10 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser (and the Company with respect to payments to the
Optionholders) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Stockholder or any other Person
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or
any provision of applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Authority, Purchaser will provide notice of such
withheld and deducted amounts to Sellers within 15 days of the date of any
withholding, and such deducted and withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders or
such other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

3.6.5 The Company and its Subsidiaries have established on its balance sheet
as of the Balance Sheet Date, in accordance with GAAP, reserves that are

the assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections or forecasts).
Nothing in this _Section 5.9_ is intended to modify or limit any of the
representations or warranties of the Company and the Stockholders set forth in

Party to this Agreement, the other Parties will execute and deliver, or cause

6.3  _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. From the Closing through
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under the Laws governing the Company and its

a party to or is involved in any proceeding by reason of the fact that such
person is or was at any time prior to the Closing, a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Indemnified Person"),

Company shall contain, and the Purchaser shall cause the certificate of

directors liability insurance policy covering the persons who were officers
and directors immediately prior to the Closing with respect to actions or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date; provided that

insurance policy for the extension of the officers and directors liability

years from and after the Closing Date with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are substantially similar to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries existing officers and directors liability insurance policy;
provided further that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required
to expend more than 250% of the annual premium for the current policy of
officers and directors liability insurance. Purchaser shall pay any
applicable premium for such insurance. The provisions of this _Section 6.3_
are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Person and such Company Indemnified Persons estate, heirs and
representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any indemnification rights
that any Company Indemnified Person or such Company Indemnified Persons
estate, heirs and representatives may have under the Organizational Documents
of any Company, any Law, any Contract or otherwise.

6.4 _Conduct of Business of the Company_. During the period from the date of

change to their capital structure or purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire or

or amend the Disclosure Schedules (each, a "Schedule Update") only with
respect to any matter hereafter first arising after the date of this Agreement
which if existing and known at the date of this Agreement would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules and would
cause a failure of the condition to the obligations of Purchaser at the
Closing set forth in  _Section 8.1.1_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless the Purchaser notifies the Stockholders
Representative or the Company of its intent to terminate this Agreement in

Affiliates to their employees generally who are similarly situated to such
Continuing Employees, at the discretion of the Purchaser.

 

6.8.2 Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall ensure, or cause to
ensure, that no limitations or exclusions as to pre-existing conditions,
evidence of insurability or good health, waiting periods or actively-at-work
exclusions or other limitations or restrictions on coverage are applicable to
any Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any
welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employees or their dependents
or beneficiaries may be eligible to participate, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date. For the plan year that includes the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred by
Continuing Employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) up to (and
including) the Closing Date shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under
any such welfare benefit plans.

6.8.3 With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice,
including vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored

all Continuing Employees from and after the Closing Date credit for all
service with the Company and its predecessors prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, and eligibility to
commence benefits and with respect to paid time off benefits only for
benefit accrual, but excluding any such credit that would result in a
duplication of benefits.

6.8.4 Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the Company to
continue any specific plans or to continue the employment of any Continuing
Employee. This _Section 6.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties in their capacity as Parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.8_, express or implied, shall
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 6.8_. Nothing contained herein, express
or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement.

 



-30- 6.8.5 The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
of the employees identified on _Annex V_ attached hereto to execute and
deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing employment agreements containing
substantially similar terms as found in the Employment Term Sheets attached

for approval, pursuant to the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, the
payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute
"parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G
Payments") (which determination shall be made by the Company and shall be
subject to review and approval by Purchaser), such that such payments and
benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser that (i) a vote of the stockholders was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with
respect to the payments and/or benefits that were subject to the stockholder
vote (the "Section 280G Stockholder Approval"), or (ii) the Section 280G
Stockholder Approval was not obtained, and as a consequence such payments
and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause
any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to valid waivers of
those payments and/or benefits executed by the affected individuals prior to
the stockholder vote.

6.9 _Financing; Financing Cooperation_.

 

6.9.1 The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to

permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing, if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would be
reasonably expected to prevent, delay or hinder the Purchasers ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, without the
Stockholders Representatives prior written consent. The Purchaser shall
promptly furnish to the Stockholders Representative a complete copy of any
amendment, supplement or other modification to the Commitment Letter and a
full description of any waiver of the Purchasers rights under the Commitment
Letter, as applicable. The Purchaser will from time to time provide such
information as the Stockholders Representative may reasonably request
regarding the status of the Financing and related negotiations.

 



-31- 6.9.2 In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter or if
the Bank is in breach of, or fails to perform, its obligations thereunder, (i)
the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Stockholders Representative and (ii)
the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources, on terms, taken as whole, that are not
materially less beneficial to the Purchaser than those contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, would not involve any material conditions to funding the
Financing that are not contained in the Commitment Letter and would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. In the event that
alternative financing shall be secured pursuant to this _Section 6.9.2_, the
Purchaser shall comply with the covenants in _Section 6.9.1_ with respect
to such alternative financing and shall promptly furnish to the Stockholders
Representative the commitment letter and term sheet, including all exhibits,
schedules or amendments thereto (or similar documents), with respect to such
alternative financing.

6.9.3 From the date hereof until Closing or the valid termination of this
Agreement, the Company and Stockholders shall, and the Stockholders shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Purchaser, and shall

materials required and/or reasonably requested by the Bank in connection with
the Financing and (B) executing and delivering customary authorization letters
relating to the Financing; (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts (A) to

"know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the Patriot Act related to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(viii) causing the taking of corporate and other actions by the Company and
its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the
Financing on the Closing Date and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available to the Purchaser as of the Closing. The Company hereby consents to
the use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective marks. The Purchaser shall (i) promptly reimburse the
Company upon the earlier of Closing or the termination of this Agreement for
all of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorney fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this _Section 6.9_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the

suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Stockholders, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its or their
Representatives.

 



-32- VII. TAX MATTERS

 

The following provisions of this _Article VII_ shall govern the allocation
between the Purchaser and the Stockholders of responsibility for certain Tax
matters involving the Company following the Closing Date. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this _Article VII_ and any other provision
of this Agreement, the provisions of this  _Article VII_ shall control.

7.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns; Control of Audits; Tax Refunds_.

 

7.1.1 The Stockholders Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared
for filing by the Company all Tax Returns for the Company for all Tax periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Periods") that are due
after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Companys past practices,
except to the extent required by applicable Law (provided that, without
Purchasers consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, the Stockholders Representative will not make any election
that increases the Taxes of the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period).
Such Tax Returns (including any related work papers or other information
reasonably requested by the Purchaser) shall be provided to the Purchaser for
its review not later than forty-five (45) Business Days before the due date
for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions). If the Purchaser does not
provide the Stockholders Representative with a written description of the
items in the Tax Returns or the tax statement that the Purchaser intends to
dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days following the delivery to the
Purchaser of such documents, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to such documents in the form provided, and the Purchaser shall
thereafter cause all such Tax Returns to be timely filed by the Company. The
Purchaser shall not make any changes to such Tax Returns without the prior
written approval of the Stockholders Representative (which approval may not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The Purchaser shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of the Stockholders for any Damages
they may suffer or incur for the Purchasers failure to timely file such Tax
Returns. The Stockholders Representative and the Purchaser agree to timely
consult with each other and to negotiate in good faith any timely-raised issue
arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns to permit the filing of
such Tax Returns as promptly as possible, which good faith negotiations shall
include each side exchanging in writing their positions concerning the
matter(s) in dispute and a meeting to discuss their respective positions. In
the event the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10)
Business Days following the delivery of written notice by the Purchaser of
such dispute, the Stockholders Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly
request the Accounting Referee to resolve any issue in dispute at least five
(5) Business Days before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such
Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting Referee shall make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue within five (5) Business
Days before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the Tax
Return in question, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to file such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions)
therefor in a manner consistent with the determination of the Accounting
Referee. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be binding on the
Parties; provided, however, that any such determination shall be limited to
the resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the Stockholders, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, that assigned amounts to items
in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount
finally determined by the Accounting Referee, or equally, in the event the
Parties assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far from the amount
finally determined by the Accounting Referee). The Stockholders
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, severally and not jointly, will
timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) all Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities (as
such term is defined herein) shown as due and owing on all such Tax Returns,
other than to the extent that an accrual with respect to such Tax is included
as a Current Liability and taken into account for purposes of determining
Closing Working Capital. Except as expressly contemplated in this _Article
VII. _, under no circumstances shall the Purchaser or the Company amend any
Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed).

 



-33- 7.1.2 In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Company for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on a closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of
any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at
such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period
that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. The Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare or cause to be
prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns for the
Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the Companys past practices, except to the extent required by applicable
Law. Such Tax Returns (including any related work papers or other information
reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative) shall be provided
to the Stockholders Representative for his review not later than forty-five
(45) Business Days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns (including
extensions). If the Stockholders Representative does not provide the
Purchaser with a written description of the items in the Tax Returns or the
tax statement that the Stockholders Representative intends to dispute within
fifteen (15) Business Days following the delivery to the Stockholders
Representative of such documents, the Stockholders shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to such documents in the form provided, and the Purchaser
shall thereafter cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed by the Company in
the form provided to the Stockholders Representative. The Purchaser and the
Stockholders Representative agree to timely consult with each other and to
negotiate in good faith any timely-raised issue arising as a result of the
review of such Tax Returns or the tax statement to permit the filing of such
Tax Returns as promptly as possible, which good faith negotiations shall
include each side exchanging in writing their positions concerning the matter
or matters in dispute and a meeting to discuss their respective positions. In
the event the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10)
Business Days following the delivery of written notice by the Stockholders
Representative of such dispute, the Purchaser and the Stockholders
Representative shall jointly request the Accounting Referee to resolve any
issue in dispute at least five (5) Business Days before the due date of such
Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting
Referee shall make a determination with respect to any disputed issue within
five (5) Business Days before the due date (including extensions) for the
filing of the Tax Return in question, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to file such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions)
therefor in a manner consistent with the determination of the Accounting
Referee. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be binding on
the Parties; provided, however, that any such determination shall be limited
to the resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the Stockholders, on the
one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, that assigned amounts to
items in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount
finally determined by the Accounting Referee, or equally, in the event the
Parties assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far from the amount
finally determined by the Accounting Referee). In addition to the Straddle
Period Tax Returns prepared by the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
7.1.2_, the Purchaser shall also submit to the Stockholders Representative,
together with Straddle Period Tax Returns, a proposed allocation of the Taxes
with respect to any such Straddle Period for which the Stockholders are
responsible pursuant to _Section 7.5.1_ hereof ("Stockholders Straddle
Period Allocation"), and the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in this
_Section 7.1.2_ shall also apply with respect to such proposed Stockholders
Straddle Period Allocation. The Stockholders severally shall pay to the
Purchaser on or before the date which is the later of three (3) Business Days
before the due date of each applicable Tax Return (after giving effect to any
valid extensions), or five (5) days after such final determination, the
amount of the Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities for which the Stockholders are
responsible as determined herein, other than to the extent that an accrual
with respect to such Tax is included as a Current Liability and taken into
account for purposes of determining Closing Working Capital.

 



-34- 7.1.3 The Purchaser and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate fully
in connection with the filing of the Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section
7.1_ and, subject in all respects to the provisions of _Section 7.2_, in
connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to the
Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation shall include reasonably furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of personnel, powers of
attorney, and the retention and (upon a Partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to the preparation of
any such Tax Return or to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding. The
Purchaser and the Stockholders Representative shall retain or cause to be
retained all books and records that are in their possession with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period in accordance with their record retentions policy, and abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority.

7.1.4 The Purchaser and the Stockholders Representative shall, upon request,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby). 

7.1.5 To the extent that, subsequent to the date hereof, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries receives (a) any Tax refund attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, and (b) any credits against Taxes in lieu of refunds described in
clause (a), such Tax refund or credits shall be the property of the
Stockholders, other than to the extent set forth in the following sentence,
and the Purchaser shall remit, and shall cause the Company and any Subsidiary
of the Company, as applicable, to remit such Tax refund(s) or credits to the
Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the Stockholders, within
ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of such Tax refunds or utilization of such Tax credits. The
foregoing shall not apply with respect to (a) any Tax refund that is reflected
as an asset of the Company or any of its that is taken into account as a
Current Asset for purposes of Closing Working capital or (b) any Tax refund
attributable to the carryback of a net operating loss that is attributable to
any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

7.1.6 The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any and all Transaction
Expense Tax Benefits shall be for the sole benefit of the Stockholders and
Optionholders and shall be allocated to the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period
ending at 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date or the applicable portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date to the extent allowed by
applicable Law. The Parties hereby agree to (i) prepare and file all Tax
Returns consistent with such allocation and (ii) the Stockholders and
Optionholders entitlement to the benefit of any and all such Tax deductions
through the end of the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period. Further, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Company to, promptly pay the amount of any
Transaction Expense Tax Benefit actually realized by Purchaser or the Company
following the Closing Date (whether by refund, credit or reduction of
liability with respect to Taxes, but only as and to the extent actually
received, with respect to any such refund, or as and to the extent actually
used to reduce the amount of Tax otherwise payable by the applicable the
Company, with respect to any such credit or reduction, as applicable) to the
Stockholders Representative, for the benefit of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing to the Purchaser by the Stockholders
Representative. Income Tax deductions attributable to Transaction Expense Tax
Benefits shall be applied to offset income realized by Purchaser and the
Company after the Closing Date before any other deductions arising in any
post-Closing period are utilized other than deductions attributable to the
ordinary operations of the business subsequent to the Closing Date (for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding deductions for interest and transaction costs),
which shall be taken into account prior to taking any of the above-described
deductions into account. Purchaser shall notify the Stockholders
Representative promptly upon realizing any Transaction Expense Tax Benefit or
receiving any refund payable to the Stockholders Representative, for the
benefit of the Stockholders and the Optionholders under this Section 7.1.6.

 



-35- 7.1.7 Without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed,
neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall make or change any election,
change any annual accounting period, file any amended Tax Return, enter into
any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Company, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, or take any other
similar action, or omit to take any action, if such action or omission would
have the effect of increasing the present or future liability or obligation
of the Stockholders to indemnify the Purchaser with respect to Taxes pursuant
to the provisions hereof.

7.2 _Tax Claims_. In the event a claim is made or a deficiency alleged
following the Closing relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
the IRS or any other taxing authority, which, if successful, would result in a
loss or liability in respect of which indemnity properly may be sought
against the Stockholders, severally, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively,
an "Indemnity Tax Matter"), then the following shall apply:

 

7.2.1 After the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives actual notice of a
claim or alleged deficiency, the Purchaser shall, or the Purchaser shall
cause the Company to, promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) notify the Stockholders Representative in writing of such claim or
alleged deficiency.

 

7.2.2 The Stockholders Representative shall have the right to represent the
interests of the Company before the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to any Indemnity Tax Matter and shall have the right to control the
defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Indemnity Tax Matter,
including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting,
defending against and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice
of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, any such
Indemnity Tax Matter. The Purchaser shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to participate in the defense of such Indemnity Tax Matter and to
employ counsel, at the Purchasers own expense, separate from counsel employed
by the Stockholders Representative on behalf of the Stockholders, and the
Stockholders Representative shall keep the Purchaser informed with respect
to the commencement, status and nature of any such Indemnity Tax Matter and
will, in good faith, allow the Purchaser to consult with it regarding the
conduct of or positions taken in any such action.

 

7.2.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.2.2_, the Stockholders
Representative shall not settle or compromise any Indemnity Tax Matter
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 

7.3 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added, and other such similar Taxes (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be split equally between the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Stockholders and Optionholders, on the
other hand, when due, and the Purchaser will, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes.

 

7.4 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Article VII_ the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

 

7.4.1 "Post-Closing Tax Period" means any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date.

 



-36- 7.4.2 "Pre-Closing Tax Period" means any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date, including without limitation the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period.

7.5 _Liability for Taxes_.

(b) with respect to Straddle Periods (if any), all Taxes imposed upon the

Period, all Taxes which are allocable, pursuant to  _Section 7.1.2_, to the
portion of such taxable year or period commencing after the Closing Date.

7.5.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders obligations to indemnify

Liabilities shall be subject to the limitations set forth in _Article IX_.

9.2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX. _, the

proportion of the Transaction Consideration allocated to such Stockholder and
Optionholder pursuant to the Allocation Certificate), and not jointly,
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Purchaser and its equity
owners, directors, managers, officers, employees, and Affiliates, and, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, all of the
foregoing the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against any and all Damages
actually incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to the
extent resulting from:

(a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company or any
Stockholder in this Agreement to be true and correct; provided, however, that
no Stockholder shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to a breach of any representation or
warranty made by another Stockholder pursuant to _Article IV_;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement required to be performed by the
Company or any Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that
no Stockholder shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to a breach of any covenant or
agreement made or to be performed by another Stockholder pursuant to this
Agreement;

(c) any Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities; 

(d) any pre-Closing Indebtedness not paid at the Closing pursuant to _Section
2.4.1(d)_ or Selling Expenses not paid at the Closing pursuant to _Section
2.4.1(e)_; or

(e) any claims relating to allocation of the Transaction Consideration among
the Stockholders and the Optionholders, including any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation on the Allocation Certificate.

9.2.2 _Time Limitations_. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no
right to recover any amounts pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_ unless on or
before the relevant survival date specified in _Section 9.1_ (such relevant
date referred to as the "Survival Date"), the Purchaser notifies the
Stockholders Representative in writing of a claim specifying the factual
basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the
Purchaser. Subject to any applicable statute of limitations and except as
otherwise provided in the Agreement, all covenants of the Parties contained in
_Article VI_ will survive the Closing indefinitely in accordance with their
terms; provided, however, that the Purchaser

 



-40-  Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any amounts pursuant to
_Section 9.2.1(b)_, _(c)_ or _(d)_ unless the Purchaser notifies the
Stockholders Representative in writing of a claim under _Section 9.2.1(b)_,
_(c)_ or _(d)_ specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable
detail to the extent then known by the Purchaser as follows: (a) with
respect to any covenant or agreement required to be performed in this
Agreement on or before the Closing, such claim is delivered within one (1)
year after the Closing, and (b) with respect to any such covenant required to

9.2.3 _Limitations on Indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_ until the total amount of such
Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under _Section
9.2.1(a)_, in the aggregate, exceeds $1,570,000 (as may be adjusted pursuant
to _Section 9.2.3(d)_, the "Deductible"), in which case the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to
_Section 9.2.1(a)_ in excess of the Deductible, subject to the other
limitations in this _Article IX_ ; provided, however, that recovery of
any amounts pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_ related to a failure of the
Fundamental Representations shall not be subject to the limitations of this
_Section 9.2.3(a)_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
each Stockholders or Optionholders maximum aggregate indemnification
liability pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_ shall be such Stockholders or
Optionholders share of the funds in the Escrow Account; provided, however,
that such maximum aggregate indemnification liability shall not apply to
breaches of the Fundamental Representations, for which each Stockholders
maximum aggregate indemnification liability pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_
shall not exceed the Transaction Consideration less any Closing Company
Cash (the aggregate amount of such cap as may be adjusted pursuant to
_Section 9.2.3(d)_, the "Fundamental Cap") (in accordance with the proportion
of the Transaction Consideration allocated to such Stockholder and
Optionholder pursuant to the Allocation Certificate). Except with respect to
the Fundamental Representations in _Articles III_ and _IV_ , the sole and
exclusive recourse for any amount finally determined to be owed in respect of
any indemnity obligations pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(a)_ shall be the funds
remaining in the Escrow Account, and once the Escrow Account shall be fully
depleted or released, such indemnity obligations shall terminate.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Stockholders or Optionholders maximum aggregate indemnification liability
pursuant to _Section 9.2.1(c)_ shall not exceed the Fundamental Cap (in
accordance with the proportion of the Transaction Consideration allocated to
such Stockholder and Optionholder pursuant to the Allocation Certificate).

(c) A Purchaser Indemnified Party may not seek indemnification for Damages
suffered by it if it has already received payment for such Damages in a post-
Closing adjustment under _Section 2.5._

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this _Section 9.2_,
in the event the Purchaser uses its best efforts but is ultimately unable to
obtain a RandW Policy within 20 days after the date of this Agreement, without
further action by any Party hereto, (i) the Deductible shall be changed to
$3,140,000, (ii) the Fundamental Cap shall be changed to ten percent (10%) of
(A) the Transaction Consideration _less_ (B) any Closing Company Cash and
(iii) the Escrow Amount shall be changed to $6,280,000 ((i), (ii) and (iii),
the "Indemnity Flip").

 

(e) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties must bring all claims for breach of
Fundamental Representations in excess of the retention amount in the RandW
Policy under the RandW Policy, in lieu of pursuing Stockholders or Optionholders
for such amounts, until the RandW Policy is exhausted. Purchaser Indemnified
Parties will maximize and prioritize insurance coverage for claims for breach
of Fundamental Representations over all other claims and amounts.

 



-41- 9.3 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

 

9.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX. _, the
Purchaser will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Stockholders, their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, stockholders,
members, partners, employees, representatives and agents (collectively, the
"Stockholder Indemnified Parties") against any and all Damages actually
incurred or suffered by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties to the extent
resulting from: (a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchaser in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing; and (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement required to be
performed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

 

9.3.2 The Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to _Section 9.3.1(a)_ and  _9.3.1(b)_ unless on or before
the Survival Date, the Stockholders Representative notifies the Purchaser in
writing of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable
detail to the extent then known by the Stockholders Representative. Any
indemnification claim by a Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.3.1(b)_ shall be required to be made by delivering notice to the Purchaser
no later than thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations.

9.3.3 The Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to _Section 9.3.1(a)_ until the total amount of such
Damages incurred by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under _Section
9.3.1(a)_, in the aggregate, exceeds the Deductible, in which case the
Stockholder Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover Damages in excess
of the Deductible; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply in
the case of fraud committed by the Purchaser or with respect to the
Fundamental Representations in _Article V_. 

9.3.4 The aggregate liability of the Purchaser for Damages under _Section
9.3.1(a)_ shall not exceed the Transaction Consideration less the Closing
Company Cash; provided, however, that such cap shall not apply in the case of
fraud committed by the Purchaser.

 

9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

9.4.1 Except as provided in _Article VII_ with respect to certain Tax
matters, if any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under
_Section 9.2_ or _9.3_ (an "Indemnified Party") receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Third Party Claim against such Indemnified
Party with respect to which the Person against whom or which such
indemnification is being sought (an "Indemnifying Party") is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give
such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, will include copies of any complaint, petition, or any other pleading
received in connection with such Third Party Claim and all available material
written evidence thereof, and will indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, or at its option (subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 9.4.1_) to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; provided, however, that:

 



-42- (a) The Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party written notice of
its election to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim within
ten (10) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the Third Party
Claim. However, if the Indemnifying Party disclaims any liability in
connection with such matter, the Indemnifying Party may give the Indemnified
Party written notice of such disclaimer of liability within ten (10) days of
the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party may only assume such defense (i) if it acknowledges
in writing that it is responsible for and will bear all monetary damages
relating to such Third Party Claim; (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party will have adequate financial resources to defend
against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations
hereunder; (iii) the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party; (iv) the maximum amount of monetary damages and related costs and
expenses which could be payable with respect to such Third Party Claim does
not exceed the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such Third-Party Claim hereunder; and (v) the Indemnified Party has not been
advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Claim.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim and to employ a recognized and reputable counsel of its
choice for such purpose; provided, however, that the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay any reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party
effectively assumes control of such defense.

9.4.2 Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
will include copies of all available material written evidence thereof, and
will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will have a period of ten (10) Business Days from which to respond in writing
to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within such
ten (10) Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party.

 

9.4.3 A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information
in any notice as provided in _Sections 9.4.1_ or  _9.4.2_ will not affect the
rights or obligations of any Party, except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any Party that was entitled to receive such notice was
deprived of its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance
coverage or was otherwise prejudiced as a result of such failure.

9.5 _Miscellaneous Indemnification Provisions_.

9.5.1 _Exclusive Remedy_. Other than claims for fraud, the indemnification
provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Indemnified Persons and their respective Affiliates for monetary damages
with respect to claims under, or otherwise relating to the transactions that
are the subject of, this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort,
fraud, or otherwise, and whether asserted against the Company or its
Subsidiaries, their respective officers, directors or employees, the
Stockholders or any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall any Party, its successors or permitted assigns
be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and its equity
owners, directors, managers, officers, employees, and Affiliates, agrees not
to bring any actions or proceedings, at Law,

 



-43-  equity or otherwise, against any other Party or its and its equity owners,
directors, managers, officers, employees, and Affiliates, in respect of any
breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement in this Agreement, except pursuant to the express provisions of this
_Article IX_. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, each Party shall be
entitled to bring an action for injunctive or other equitable relief to
enforce the terms of this Agreement, including specific performance, and no
limitation or condition of liability provided in this _Article IX_ shall
apply to any claim arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
criminal misconduct by a Party.

9.5.2 _Transaction Consideration Adjustment_. The Parties agree that
any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Transaction Consideration for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 

9.5.3 _Purchaser Knowledge_. The right to indemnification or other remedy
based upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted or any knowledge capable of
being acquired at any time prior to Closing, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements, except to the extent the Purchaser had actual
knowledge prior to the Closing of a breach of a representation or warranty.
For purposes of this _Section 9.5.3_, "actual knowledge" of Purchaser means,
with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty, that Patrick
Hawkins, Kathleen Pepski or Richard Erstad had actual conscious awareness of
facts or circumstances recognized by such person as constituting a breach of a
representation or warranty, and for the avoidance of doubt does not include
constructive or imputed knowledge nor does it include any actual, constructive
or imputed knowledge of any advisor or agent of Purchaser, nor does it require
any duty or obligation of inquiry.

 

9.5.4 _Effect of Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of calculating the
amount of Damages incurred out of or relating to any failure or breach of
this Agreement and for purposes of determining whether or not a failure or
breach has occurred, concepts of "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or
words of similar import shall be disregarded.

 

9.5.5 _Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries_. The amount of Damages
recoverable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this  _Article IX_ with
respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by (a) the amount of insurance
proceeds actually recovered by such Indemnified Party with respect to the
Damages to which such indemnity claim relates, net of any expenses related to
the receipt of such payment, including retrospective premium adjustments, if
any, occasioned by such Damages; and (b) the amount of any Tax Benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party in the taxable period in which the
Damages occurred or in the taxable period immediately thereafter. For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Tax Benefit" means the actual reduction of Tax
liabilities (calculated on the basis of the actual reduction in cash
payments for Taxes) resulting from an increase in deductions, losses or tax
credits or decrease in the income, gain or recapture of tax credits that the
Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or other affiliated entity thereof
actually reported or took into account (other than by way of any increase in
basis) in the taxable period (or portions thereof) in which the Damages
occurred or in the taxable period immediately thereafter.

 

9.5.6 _No Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any punitive Damages of such other Person (except to the
extent that such punitive Damages are awarded to a third party).

 

9.6 _Good Faith; Mutual Cooperation_. The Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which Party is obligated to
indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making all commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

 



-44- 9.7 _No Recourse to Lenders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement,
the Stockholders and the Company agree on their behalf and on behalf of their
Affiliates that none of the Bank, the lenders, or the arranger in the
Commitment Letter or other documents related to the Financing shall have any
liability or obligation to the Stockholders or the Company or their
Subsidiaries and Affiliates relating to this Agreement, the Financing or any
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Agreement that would prevent or has prevented the satisfaction of any
condition to the obligations of the Purchaser, as applicable, at the Closing,
and such breach has not been waived by the Purchaser, as applicable, or, in

by the Purchaser of any matter set forth in this Agreement and (b) the
Company and the Stockholders will not be released from liability hereunder if
this Agreement is terminated and the transactions abandoned by reason of (i)
failure of the Company or Stockholders to have performed its or their
material obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any material

forth in this Agreement. Nothing in this  _Section 10.1.2_ will relieve any
Party of liability for breach of this Agreement occurring prior to any
termination, or for breach of any provision of this Agreement which
specifically survives termination hereunder, subject to the express terms and
limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 



-45- 10.2 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document required or

unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
and such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision will be

contained herein and there had been contained in this Agreement instead such
valid, legal and enforceable provisions as would most nearly accomplish the
intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

10.15 _Legal Representation_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement including under _Article IX. _, each Company

matter of this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms
and provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they
