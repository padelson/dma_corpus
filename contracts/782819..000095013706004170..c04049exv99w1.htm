understanding) any Acquisition Proposal or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any proposed Acquisition Proposal or assist others in
making an Acquisition Proposal. 

   

(b) Notwithstanding §5.6(a) and any other provision of this Agreement, nothing
will prevent the Board of Directors of Western, before receipt of Western

(iii) is given in sufficient detail to enable the Board of Directors of
Western, acting reasonably and in good faith to determine, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, having
regard to all circumstances, that such Acquisition Proposal would, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, be reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and after consultation with outside legal counsel, the
Board of Directors of Western determines that its failure to consider or
participate in such discussions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws. 

   

(c) Western will 

   

(i) as of the date of this Agreement, have advised Glamis in writing of
all Acquisition Proposals then under consideration and Western will cease and
cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement, activity,

to be in connection with or that may result in an Acquisition Proposal or for
access to the properties, books or records of Western or any of the Western
Subsidiaries by any Person that informs Western or such Subsidiary that such
Person is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such

made to Western, including the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal. 

   

(d) If Western receives a request for material non-public information from a
Person who delivers a bona fide Acquisition Proposal in writing and the Board
of Directors of Western determines that such proposal meets the requirements
of §5.6(b) then, and only in such case, the Board of Directors of Western
may, subject to the execution by such Person of a confidentiality agreement
on substantially the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreement, provide
such Person with access to information regarding Western or any of the
Western Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal will not be precluded under such confidentiality
agreement from making the Acquisition Proposal, and provided further that
Western sends a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to Glamis promptly
upon its execution and that Glamis is provided with a list of or, in the case
of information that was not previously made available to Glamis, copies of
any information provided to such Person.

agents and its Subsidiaries and their officers and directors, representatives
and agents and any financial advisors or other advisors or representatives
retained by it are aware of the provisions of this §5.6, and it will be

that an Acquisition Proposal, if consummated in accordance with its terms,
would be a Superior Proposal it will provide Glamis with notice in writing

and detailing the Superior Proposal, at least 5 Business Days before the date
on which the Board of Directors of Western proposes to accept, approve,

and if such notice is given less than 5 Business Days before the Western
Meeting, Western will, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties,

(c) During the 5 Business Days period referred to in §5.7(b), Glamis will have
the opportunity, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the
Transaction. If Glamis makes an amended offer in respect of the Transaction,
the Board of Directors of Western will determine, in its good faith exercise
of its fiduciary duties after consultation with its legal advisors and upon
written advice from its independent financial advisor, if the amended offer
made by Glamis would result in the Acquisition Proposal no longer being a
Superior Proposal and  ##### 

 

 

\- 28 -   

(i) if the Acquisition Proposal is determined by the Board of Directors of
Western to no longer be a Superior Proposal, Western will accept Glamis
amended offer and the Parties will enter into an amendment to this Agreement
and if such amendment requires the Circular to be amended, Western will, if
necessary, adjourn the Western Meeting in order to allow Western to prepare,
in cooperation with Glamis, an amendment to the Circular and to forward such
to the Western Shareholders, or 

   

(ii) if the Board of Directors of Western continues to believe, in good faith,
that the Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, Western may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to §9.1(f) and, upon payment of 50% of the fee set
forth in §9.3(b) prior to or concurrent with the termination, accept,
approve, recommend or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement
in respect of the Superior Proposal and Western will pay the remaining 50% of
the fee set forth in §9.3(b) in accordance with §9.3(c). 

   

(d) Western will promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Transaction by
press release after any Acquisition Proposal is determined not to be a
Superior Proposal, any such press release to be prepared in accordance with
§5.1. 

   

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that each successive
modification in any material respect of any Acquisition Proposal will
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this §5.7. 

  

Access to Information and Confidentiality 

  

5.8 Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws, upon
reasonable notice, Western will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to
afford Glamis officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized

business hours from the date hereof and until the earlier of the Effective

management personnel of Western and the Western Subsidiaries, and during such
period, Western will and will cause each of the Western Subsidiaries to
furnish promptly to Glamis all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel which Glamis may reasonably request. Subject to
applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice, Glamis will (and will cause each of
the Glamis Subsidiaries to) provide the same access to Western and its
Representatives on the same terms and conditions.  #####

Notice and Cure Provisions

documentation with the Registrar, Glamis or Western, as the case may be,
has delivered a written notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail
all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters
which Glamis or Western, as the case may be, is asserting as the basis for
the non-fulfilment of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of
the termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that Glamis or Western, as the case may be, is proceeding diligently
to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured, the other

(A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or made by
any person other than Glamis prior to the Western Meeting and not withdrawn
more than three Business Days prior to the Western Meeting, and (B) Western
enters into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or an

Proposal is completed and (B) 120 days from the date on which the first 50%
of the fee is paid;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | in the case of termination pursuant to §9.3(b)(ii), as
to 50% prior to or concurrent with termination and 50% on the earlier of (A)

(d) Each of Glamis and Western acknowledges and agrees that if the full fee is
paid to Glamis by Western pursuant to §9.3(b) and §9.3(c), the amount so paid
and accepted is in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy which
Glamis may be entitled to and will constitute payment of liquidated damages
which are a genuine estimate of the damages which Glamis will suffer or incur
as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant
termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Western irrevocably
waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated
damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, Glamis agrees that
the payment of any amount pursuant to §9.3(b) and §9.3(c) is the sole
monetary remedy available to it and that it will not have any alternative
right or remedy against Western for damages, whether for
consequential damages or otherwise.

CERTIFICATES 

  

4.1 After the Effective date, certificates formerly representing Western

ARTICLE 5

 

RIGHTS OF DISSENT AND APPRAISAL 

  

5.1 Notwithstanding §3.1, holders of Western Shares may exercise rights of
dissent (the "Dissent Right") in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to
the Interim Order and in the manner set forth in Sections 242 to 247 of the
BCBCA (collectively, the "Dissent Procedures"), subject to the provisions of
this Article 5. 

  

5.2 Western Shareholders who duly exercise Dissent Rights with respect to
their Western Shares ("Dissenting Shares") and who are ultimately: 

    

(a) entitled to be paid fair value for their Dissenting Shares will be deemed
to have transferred their Dissenting Shares which have been redesignated as
Class B Shares to Western Copper in accordance with §3.1; or 

   

(b) not entitled for any reason to be paid for their Dissenting Shares, will
be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a non-
dissenting Western Shareholder and will receive Glamis Shares and Western
Copper Shares on the same basis as every other non-dissenting Western
Shareholder; 

 

but in no case will Western be required to recognize such persons as holding
Western Shares on or after the Effective Date.  ##### 

 

 

-9-   

5.3 If a Western Shareholder exercises the Dissent Right, Glamis and Western
Copper will on the Effective Date set aside a number of Glamis Shares and
Western Copper Shares, respectively, which is attributable under the
Arrangement to the Western Shares for which Dissent Rights have
been exercised. If the dissenting Western Shareholder is ultimately not
entitled to be paid for their Dissenting Shares, they will be deemed to have
participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as the non-dissenting
Western Shareholders and Glamis and Western will be deemed to have
distributed to such Western Shareholder the Glamis Shares and Western Copper
Shares that the Western Shareholder is entitled to receive pursuant to the
terms of the Arrangement. If a Western Shareholder duly complies with the
Dissent Procedures and is ultimately entitled to be paid for their Dissenting
Shares, Western Copper will pay the amount to be paid in respect of the
Dissenting Shares and in consideration therefor, Western Copper will be
deemed to have acquired the Dissenting Shares which have been redesignated as
Class B Shares in accordance with §3.1 and will be deemed to have
participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as the non-dissenting
Western Shareholders (except that Western Copper will not be entitled to
receive Western Copper Shares) and Glamis will be deemed to have distributed
to Western Copper the Glamis Shares that Western Copper is entitled to
receive in exchange for the Dissenting Shares which have been redesignated as
Class B Shares and exchanged for Class A Shares in accordance with §3.1
pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement. In addition, Western Copper will
pay Western 3.5815% of the direct out of pocket costs incurred by Western in
dealing with the Dissent Procedures.

amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts

the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made,
