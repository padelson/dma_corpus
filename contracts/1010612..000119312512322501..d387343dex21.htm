Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the registered holder of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate in form and substance acceptable to Parent and Newco (if
such affidavit is accepted before the Effective Time) or the Paying Agent (if
such affidavit is accepted after the Effective Time), and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such registered holder of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Preferred Stock Consideration or Common Stock
Consideration, as applicable, in respect thereof in the manner set forth in
this _Section 2.9_. 

 



20 (c) If Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date that is three years
after the Effective Time, unclaimed amounts (including interest thereon) of
Preferred Stock Consideration and Common Stock Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation and may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with the provisions of this _Section 2.9_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment for
their claims in the form and amounts to which such stockholders are entitled.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Preferred Stock
or Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) are presented to the Paying Agent, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the applicable Preferred Stock Consideration or
Common Stock Consideration, as applicable, as provided for, and in accordance
with, the provisions of this _Section 2.9_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed for twelve
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Agreement and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed
to such holders after the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the applicable Preferred Stock Consideration or Common Stock
Consideration, as applicable, to which they are entitled.

(f) None of Parent, Newco, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any payment
pursuant to this Agreement would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity), the cash payment in respect of such Certificate
shall, unless otherwise provided by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all Liens.

 

Section 2.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Preferred Stock and Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by
stockholders who shall have properly exercised their appraisal rights with
respect thereto under Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Preferred Stock
and Common Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive such stockholders Preferred Stock Consideration or
Common Stock Consideration pursuant to the Merger, but shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that each Dissenting Share held
by a stockholder who shall thereafter withdraw his or her demand for appraisal
or shall fail to perfect his or her right to such payment as provided in
such Section 262 shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective Time,
into the right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration or Common Stock
Consideration that such holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive
as a result of the Merger.

 



21 Section 2.11 _Options and Warrants._ The Company shall ensure that, at
the Effective Time, each Option (whether vested or unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time) that has an exercise price per shares that is less than
the Common Stock Consideration (an " _In-the-Money Option_ ") shall
immediately and without further action by the holder thereof be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount per share of Common Stock
underlying such In-the-Money Option equal to the Common Stock Consideration
_less_ the exercise price per share (the " _Option Consideration_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, any Option with a per share exercise price in excess of
the per share Common Stock Consideration shall be automatically canceled as of
the Effective Time pursuant to this _Section 2.11(a)_ without payment to the
holder thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section
2.11(a)_, including, without limitation, the provision of any required
notices to the holders of Options and the making of any necessary amendments
to the Option Plan.

(b) The Company shall ensure that, at the Effective Time, each Warrant then
outstanding shall immediately and without further action be canceled,
terminated, and extinguished and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto (it being understood that, pursuant to the terms of the
Warrants, the Company shall have given notice of the Merger to the holders of
all Warrants and, in accordance with the terms of such Warrants, such holders
shall have had the opportunity to exercise such Warrants prior to the Closing
Time).

Section 2.12  _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Davis Graham and Stubbs
LLP, 1550 Seventeenth Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202 at 10:00
A.M. Denver time on the Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement (other than those conditions that
by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or on such date and
time as the Company and Newco shall mutually agree. The time and date of the
Closing is herein called the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 2.13 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct and withhold
Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder (including any payments to be
made under the Escrow Agreement) if such withholding is required by Law, and
to collect any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate
IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from any Company
Securityholder and any other recipient of any payment hereunder; _provided_ ,
however, that if on or prior to the Closing, the Company provides Parent with
the certificate described in _Section 6.2(b)(iv)_, no withholding of any
amount under Section 1445 of the Code shall be made by Parent or Newco. To the
extent that amounts are withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been delivered and paid to the applicable Company Securityholder or
other recipient of payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

 

Section 2.14 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) _Closing Adjustment_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good faith estimate of Closing
Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), which
statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet

 



22  of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of Estimated Closing Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), and a
certificate of the Company that the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement was prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles.
The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to the books and
records of the Company, and other Company documents, to verify the information
set forth in the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement prior to the
Closing Date. The " _Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the
Estimated Closing Working Capital minus the Target Working Capital. If the
Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Merger Consideration shall be
increased by the amount of the Closing Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment
is a negative number, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount
of the Closing Adjustment. In addition, at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good faith estimate of
the cash and cash equivalents expected to be on hand as of the Closing Time
(the " _Estimated Cash Balance_ "), as well as the expected amount of the
Closing Date Indebtedness as of the Closing Time (the " _Expected Closing
Date Indebtedness_ "), for purposes of computing the amount to be paid to the
Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.7_. The Company shall provide Parent with
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company, and other
Company documents, to verify such amounts.

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than the 60th day following the
Closing Date, Parent will cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Stockholder Representative a statement setting forth its calculation of the
Closing Working Capital, which statement shall contain a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to
the transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of Closing Working
Capital (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") and a certificate of the
Parent that the Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles. The Closing Working Capital Statement
shall also set forth the variance, if any, between the Estimated Cash Balance
and the actual amount of the cash and cash equivalents at the Closing Time
(the " _Actual Cash Balance_ "), and the variance, if any, between the
Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness and the actual Closing Date Indebtedness
as of the Closing Time (the " _Actual Closing Date Indebtedness_ "). The post-
closing adjustment shall be an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital
minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital, reduced by any negative
difference between the Actual Cash Balance and the Estimated Cash Balance and
any positive difference between Actual Closing Date Indebtedness and
Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, and increased by any positive difference
between the Actual Cash Balance and the Estimated Cash Balance and any
negative difference between Actual Closing Date Indebtedness and
Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ "), as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.14(c)(iii)_, if applicable.

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall within three (3) Business Days of the final
determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment (including any Review Period
and/or Resolution Period as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.14(c)_
below) issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent an amount equal to such excess (without deduction) out of the Escrow
Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Parent.

 



23 (ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Parent will pay
to the Paying Agent, on behalf of the holders of Outstanding Common Shares
(other than the Dissenting Shares), an amount equal to (A) such excess
(without deduction) multiplied by (B) a fraction, (I) the numerator of which
is the Outstanding Common Shares minus the total number of Outstanding Common
Shares that are Dissenting Shares and (II) the denominator of which is the
Outstanding Common Shares. Any amount payable by Parent to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this  _Section 2.14(b)(ii)_ will be paid within three (3)
Business Days of the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment
(including any Review Period and/or Resolution Period as may be required
pursuant to  _Section 2.14(c)_ below) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
shall distribute to each holder of Outstanding Common Shares who has
surrendered before such payment date his, her or its Certificate(s) and duly
executed letter of transmittal (and to each holder of In-the-Money Options),
such holders pro rata share of any payments pursuant to this _Section
2.14(b)(ii)_ (based on the number of Outstanding Common Shares held by such
holder (or underlying such holders In-the-Money Options) in relation to all
Outstanding Common Shares). If and to the extent there are holders of
Outstanding Common Shares who have not yet surrendered their Certificates,
the Paying Agent shall distribute the remainder of the payment(s) pursuant to
_Section 2.9_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any payments
pursuant to this _Section 2.14(b)(ii)_ are deemed to be compensation income
to the recipient thereof, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their
best efforts to ensure that such payments are properly processed through the
Surviving Corporations payroll system.

 

(iii) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.14(b)_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

(c) _Examination and Review_. 

(i) After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, Stockholder
Representative shall have 45 days (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the
Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Stockholder
Representative and Stockholder Representatives accountants shall have full
access to the books and records of the Company, the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by, Parent and/or Parents accountants to the extent that they
relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical
financial information relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as
Stockholder Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing
the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections
(defined below), _provided_ that such access shall be in a manner that does
not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

(ii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Stockholder
Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth Stockholder
Representatives objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed
item or amount and the basis for Stockholder Representatives disagreement
therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If

 



24  Stockholder Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in
the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by
Stockholder Representative. If Stockholder Representative delivers the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Parent
and Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections within 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of Objections
(the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved within
the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working
Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in
writing by Parent and Stockholder Representative, shall be final and binding.

 

(iii) Resolution of Disputes. If Stockholder Representative and Parent fail to
reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ " and any amounts not so
disputed, the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution to
an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants appointed by mutual agreement of Parent and Stockholder
Representative (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") who, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Working Capital Statement. The parties hereto agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively.

(iv) Fees of the Independent Accountants. Stockholder Representative, solely
on behalf of the Company Securityholders and in its capacity as the
Stockholder Representative and not in its individual capacity, and Parent
shall each pay 50% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants.
For the avoidance of doubt, such fees, to the extent paid by the Stockholder
Representative, shall be paid out of the Expense Funds.

Section 2.15 _Release of Escrow_.

(a) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on the date that is nine
(9) months following the Closing Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day,
then the first (1st) Business Day thereafter) (the " _Interim Release Date_
"), the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent on behalf of the holders
of Company Equity Securities (other than Dissenting Stockholders), in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, an aggregate amount in cash
equal to the lesser of (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Escrow Amount minus
amounts required to be retained pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including
amounts required to be retained for any outstanding and unresolved claims
brought pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof prior to the Interim Release Date,
or (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the Escrow Amount (the " _Interim Escrow
Release Amount_ ").

 



25 (b) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date (or, if such date is not a Business
Day, then the first (1st) Business Day thereafter) (the " _Escrow Release
Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent on behalf of the
holders of Company Equity Securities (other than Dissenting Stockholders), in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, an aggregate amount in
cash equal to remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, if any, other than
amounts required to be retained pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including
amounts required to be retained for any outstanding and unresolved claims
brought pursuant to  _Article VIII_ hereof prior to the Escrow Release Date
(the " _Escrow Release Amount_ ").

(c) As and to the extent any claim described in clause (a)(i) or (b) above is
resolved in favor of the Company Securityholders, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Paying Agent on
behalf of the holders of Company Equity Securities (other than the Dissenting
Stockholders) the related portion of the remaining amounts in the Escrow
Account as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

(d) Within three (3) Business Days of receipt of any amount required to be
delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will pay
to each holder of Company Equity Securities (other than Dissenting
Stockholders) who has surrendered before the Escrow Release Date his, her or
its Certificates and duly executed letter of transmittal (and to each holder
of In-the-Money Options), such holders pro rata share (based on the amount
such holder contributed to the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_
through _(k)_ ) of the Interim Escrow Release Amount or Escrow Release Amount,
as the case may be. If and to the extent there are holders of Company Equity
Securities who have not yet surrendered their Certificates, the Paying Agent
will cause such amounts to be distributed pursuant to _Section 2.9_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any payments pursuant to this
Section are deemed to be compensation income to the recipient thereof,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the Stockholder Representative shall
use their best efforts to ensure that such payments are properly processed
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system.

that may be required to be included in its income for any Post-Closing Period
under section 78 of the Canadian Tax Act or a corresponding provincial
provision. The Canadian Subsidiary has not acquired property in circumstances
that would result in the Canadian Subsidiary becoming liable to pay Taxes of

engaging, in any unfair labor practice with respect to employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries except to the extent such failure to comply

Company shall take commercially reasonable efforts to correct such failures
under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System contained in Revenue
Procedure 2008-50 on or before the Closing Date. Each Employee Plan that is
intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan" under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal

defined in ERISA Section 607(1), sponsored or maintained by the Company, no
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company has engaged in any action
or failed to act in such a manner that, as a result of such action or failure
to act, would cause a tax to be imposed on the Company under Code Section
4980B(a), or would cause a penalty to be imposed under ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. With respect to all such plans, all
applicable provisions of Code Section 4980B and ERISA Sections 601-606 have
been complied with by the Company, and all other provisions of ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder have been complied with.

401(a) (or its related trust) holds any stock or other securities of the
Company.

Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to Employee Plans.

the Company and its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Newco with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent and
Newco may from time to time reasonably request. All of such information shall
be treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) For a period of seven years commencing on the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation (or its successor) will retain all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the business of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date and provide any Company
Securityholders and their authorized representatives during normal business

and records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (or their
successors) and other written information with respect to the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (or their successors) as any such Company
Securityholders may from time to time reasonably request.

Section 5.2 _Conduct of Business by the Company_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date,
the Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, conduct its

respect to voting of any of its capital stock or any securities convertible

(d) (i) incur or assume any indebtedness for borrowed money or issue any debt

_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this  _Section 5.2(m)_, the
term "Material Contract" shall not include contracts described in _Section

(o) authorize, resolve, commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives, agents and Affiliates (including any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, and it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it
or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, after the date
hereof (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or knowingly take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiry or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding a Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
however, that if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that such action
is reasonably necessary in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to
comply with their fiduciary duties to the

 



42  Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the Company may, in response to
a Takeover Proposal received by the Company with respect to which the Company
has complied with this  _Section 5.3(a)_, (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company to any person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) participate in negotiations regarding such Takeover
Proposal.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any
Takeover Proposal (and in no event later than 48 hours following the
Companys, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their representatives receipt
of such Takeover Proposal), such notice to include the identity of the Person
making such Takeover Proposal and a copy of such Takeover Proposal, including
draft agreements or term sheets submitted in connection therewith (or, where
no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of the material
terms of such Takeover Proposal), including any modifications thereto. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of any material developments with respect to such Takeover Proposal
and shall provide Parent with copies of all written inquiries and
correspondence with respect to such Takeover Proposal no later than 48 hours
following the receipt thereof.

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3_, neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or
this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary
in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, under
circumstances not involving a breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ in any material
respect, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to the following
sentences) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger and
this Agreement, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (each, a " _Change
of Recommendation_ ") or terminate this Agreement, but in each case only at a
time that is after the third Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, and only if (A) the Company, if requested by
Parent, shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such three
Business Day period to amend the terms of this Agreement so that the Superior
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) thereafter,
the Takeover Proposal remains a Superior Proposal.

Section 5.4  _Public Announcements_. The timing and content of all
announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in
advance by the Company and the Parent;  _provided_ that (i) no party hereto
may make any public announcement prior to the Closing Date without the express
written consent of all other parties hereto, and (ii) any party hereto may,
after consultation with the other parties hereto, make any such announcement
which it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary in
connection with any requirement of Law, it being understood and agreed that
any such disclosing party shall promptly provide the other parties hereto
with copies of any such announcement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the

 



43  contrary, following the Closing Date and the public announcement of the
Merger in accordance with this _Section 5.4_, the Stockholder Representative
shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been engaged to serve as
the Stockholder Representative in connection with the Merger as long as such
announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated herein.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Parent hereby agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, for a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing
Date, provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries compensation
and employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are comparable to
the compensation paid to such employees and the Employee Plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to grant all employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries credit for any service with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation
accrual under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date (the " _New Plans_ "). In addition, Parent hereby agrees that it shall
cause (i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive all pre-
existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Employee Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii) any covered
expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered
dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be taken into
account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable
New Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to be solely responsible for any obligations arising under COBRA
with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall
be construed to give any Person other than the Parties hereto, including,
without limitation, any employees of the Company, any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim hereunder, including any right to further employment by
the Company after Closing.

Section 5.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. Each of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter Documents as of
the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or
prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, agents or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who were otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the Company Charter Documents. The Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect for six years after the Effective Time the
current policies of

 



44  the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than the existing policies (including with respect to the period
covered). The foregoing notwithstanding, in no event will Parent be required
to expend annually in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage (and to the extent the annual premium would
exceed 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage, Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained
the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 300% of such annual
premium). Parent will indemnify each individual who served as a director or
officer of the Company at any time prior to the Effective Date from and
against all third party actions, suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations,
claims, etc. including all court costs and reasonable attorney fees and
expenses resulting from or arising out of, or caused by, this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.7 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
Parent and Newco hereby agree that they are not authorized to and shall not
(and shall not permit any of their respective employees, agents,
representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee (excluding executive
officers), customer, supplier, distributor or any other material business
relation of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing without the
prior consent of the Company.

 

Section 5.8 _Newco_. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Newco
to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to ensure
that, prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall not conduct any business or
make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement and will not have any assets (other than cash paid to Newco for the
issuance of its stock to Parent).

Section 5.9 _Stockholder Materials_. Upon receipt of the Company
Securityholders Approval, the Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared a
notice to all Company Securityholders pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL
(the " _Stockholder Materials_ "), and shall cause such Stockholder Materials
to be delivered to all Company Securityholders. Such Stockholder Materials,
including the delivery of such Stockholder Materials to Company
Securityholders, shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable Law.

Section 5.10  _Tax Covenants_.

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent included as a liability in
determining the Closing Working Capital, the Company Securityholders shall be
liable for and covenant to pay, and pursuant to _Article VIII_ shall reimburse
each Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow Account, the amount of any and all
Losses incurred by such Parent Indemnitee (except to the extent that Taxes
which are being claimed as Losses were paid prior to the Closing Date) as a
result of: (i) all Taxes of the Company and each Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (net of any Tax refunds); (ii) all Taxes that the Company
or any Subsidiary is liable for (including under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Laws) solely as
a result of being a member of (or leaving) an affiliated, consolidated,
combined,

 



45  or unitary Tax group on or before the Closing Date; (iii) all Taxes of any
other Person that the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is liable for as a
result of transferee liability, successor liability, or a contractual
obligation, in each case, that is attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;
(iv) all Taxes resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in _Section 3.9_ or a covenant contained in this _Section 5.10_;
and (v) any Transfer Taxes for which the Company Securityholders are
responsible pursuant to _Section 5.10(i)_; _provided_ , however, that the
Company Securityholders shall not be liable for and shall have no
responsibility to indemnify any Parent Indemnitee for any amount under this
_Section 5.10(a)_ with respect to any Taxes of the Company or Subsidiary for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such Taxes arose as a result of an
action, election, activity or failure of Parent, Newco, the Surviving
Corporation, any Subsidiary, or an Affiliate of the foregoing that is outside
the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date or in a Post-Closing Tax Period (including the portion of a
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date as determined under _Section
5.10(b)(ii))_.

(b) For purposes of determining the Taxes, the form of interest or penalties
or Taxes for any Straddle Period for which the Company Securityholders or
Parent are liable under _Section 5.10(a)_, the Company Securityholders, the
Surviving Corporation, and Parent agree as follows:

(i) Taxes in the form of interest, penalties, additions to tax or other
additional amounts that relate to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be treated as occurring in such Pre-Closing Tax Period, whether such items are
incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the
Closing Date;

(ii) Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period using the following conventions: (A) in
the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis, the amount apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and the balance of such
Taxes shall be apportioned to the Post-Closing Tax Period; and (B) in the case
of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and
use Taxes) the amount apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined as if the Company or the applicable Subsidiary had filed a separate
Tax Return (on a consolidated or unitary basis, or as separate taxpayers, as
applicable) with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books
methodology," and the balance of such Taxes shall be apportioned to the Post-
Closing Tax Period. For purposes of clause (B), any item determined on an
annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions
and the effects of graduated rates) shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period based on the relative number of days in such portion of the
Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period and the balance of such items shall be apportioned to the Post-Closing
Tax Period; _provided_ , however, that a deduction for seventy percent (70%)
of any success-based fee in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2011-29 and a
deduction for any deductible Seller Expenses, to the

 



46  extent that such amounts are paid or accrued by the Company during a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, as well as deductions for any other amounts that have been
paid or accrued by the Company during a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
apportioned to or treated as deductions of a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(c) _Tax Returns_. 

(i) Parent shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to prepare and timely
file all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary that are due (after
taking into account all appropriate extensions) after the Closing Date. To the
extent that a Tax Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practices, procedures and accounting methods unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, in which case Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
mutually agree on a procedure, practice, accounting method or
other contemplated treatment with sufficient legal support to avoid the
imposition of Taxes in the form of penalties (and neither Parent nor the
Company Securityholders may unreasonably delay, withhold or condition its
agreement). When allowable under applicable Law, the taxable year of the
Company shall close on the Closing Date, and the Parent shall cause the
Company to make any available elections to effect such result. The Companys
U.S. federal income Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the
Closing Date (or the Straddle Period) will claim a current deduction for
seventy percent (70%) of any success-based fee in accordance with Revenue
Procedure 2011-29, and a current deduction for any deductible
Seller Expenses, to the extent that such amounts are paid or accrued by the
Company during such Pre-Closing Tax Period as well as deductions available for
any other amounts that have been paid or accrued by the Company during a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. 

(ii) No later than thirty (30) days (except with respect to sales Tax returns
of the Canadian Subsidiary for which the period shall be no later than
fifteen (15) days) prior to the due date (after applicable extensions) of any
income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or any
other Tax Return that shows a Tax the Company Securityholders are required to
pay or are liable for (any such Tax Return, a " _Seller Tax Return_ ") Parent
shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a draft of such Tax Return for
review by the Stockholder Representative. If the Stockholder Representative
disputes the manner in which any Seller Tax Return is prepared or any Taxes
relating thereto are or should be determined or calculated, the Stockholder
Representative shall provide written notice of such objection or dispute to
Parent within ten (10) days following receipt of such Seller Tax Return
(except with respect to sales Tax returns of the Canadian Subsidiary for which
the period shall be five (5) days). If any such notice is provided,
the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such dispute or objection. If, after ten (10) days from the date
on which written notice was provided (except with respect to sales Tax returns
of the Canadian Subsidiary for which the period shall be five (5) days), any
dispute or objection raised therein remains unresolved, the unresolved dispute
shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm selected by Parent and
the Stockholder Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution and
the decision of the Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties hereto. All costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm and of
amendment of a Seller Tax Return, if required, shall be borne by the non-
prevailing party (or shall be shared equally if both parties prevail on
material issues).

 



47 (iii) Unless required by Law, or a determination of a Governmental
Entity that is final, Parent shall not, and shall not allow the Company or
any Subsidiary, to file any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim a refund
for Taxes, in each case, if such Tax Return or claim for refund relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior written permission of the
Stockholder Representative.

(iv) The parties agree that the Company shall cause the Canadian Subsidiary
to prepare an election under subsection 256(9) of the Canadian Tax Act such
that for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act the Closing Time shall be elected to
be 12:00 a.m. on the Closing Date. Such election such be filed within the
prescribed time period and on the prescribed form.

(d) _Tax Contests_. Parent, the Company and any Subsidiary shall have the
exclusive authority to control any examination, investigation, audit, or other
proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary (a " _Tax Contest_ "),  _provided_ that (i) Parent, the
Stockholder Representative, the Company and any relevant Subsidiary, in each
case individually bearing the costs and expenses such entity has incurred,
shall jointly control any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates to Taxes
or Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
and (ii) Parent, the Company and any Subsidiary shall not settle or otherwise
resolve any Tax Contest it controls (either alone or jointly) or issues
raised in such Tax Contest if such settlement or resolution results in, or
reasonably could be expected to result in, an increase in, or assessment of,
Taxes for which the Company Securityholders are liable under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative (which
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and the Stockholder
Representative shall not settle or otherwise resolve any Tax Contest it
controls (either alone or jointly) or any issue raised in such Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

(e) _Notice_. Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative
following receipt by Parent of any written notice of a Tax Contest relating to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period. No failure or delay of Parent, the Company, or any
Subsidiary in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise
affect the obligations or liabilities of the Company Securityholders pursuant
to this Agreement except to the extent that such failure or delay shall
adversely affect or prejudice the ability of the Stockholder Representative to
contest any claim relating, directly or indirectly, to a Tax Contest relating
to such notice.

 

(f) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i)
assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the Company
or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (ii)
assist in any audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Company or any Subsidiary (whether or not a Tax Contest) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (iii) make available any information,
records, or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing

 



48  Tax Period or Straddle Period; (iv) provide any information required to
allow Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or the Stockholder
Representative to comply with any information reporting or withholding
requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws; and (v) provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Returns, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any Transfer
Tax.

(g) _Tax Benefit._ If the Company Securityholders make any indemnity payment
under  _Section 5.10(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_, and the payment or event
giving rise to such payment actually results in a U.S. federal, state, local
or foreign Tax benefit to Parent, the Company, any Subsidiary or their
Affiliates in the year of the Loss or thereafter, then (i) any indemnity
amount to be paid under _Section 5.10(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_ with respect
to such Loss shall be reduced by such Tax benefit actually realized prior to
the indemnity payment, and (ii) to the extent such Tax benefit is actually
realized after the Company Securityholders pay the Parent Group member such
indemnity payment under _Section 5.10(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_, Parent shall
deposit into the Escrow Account (or, if the Escrow Account is no longer in
existence, pay to the Paying Agent or as otherwise directed by the Stockholder
Representative) the amount of such Tax benefit within ten (10) days of filing
the Tax Return realizing the benefit (or if the Tax benefit is in the form of
increased Tax refund, ten (10) days of receiving the refund).

(h) _Tax Refunds_.

(i) At the Stockholder Representatives request, the Company and any
Subsidiary shall apply, at the sole cost and expense of the Company
Securityholders, for any Tax refund available for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
ending on the Closing Date that is payable to the Company Securityholders
under this Agreement or otherwise. Except as provided in _Section
5.10(h)(ii)_, the Company Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any
such Tax refund, or any other Tax refund that the Company and any Subsidiary
may receive that is not the result of a request by the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period if and when any such Tax refund is received by the Company
or any Subsidiary (provided that such Tax refund shall be offset against any
then existing Tax liability of the Company or any Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period), and the Company or such Subsidiary shall promptly deposit into
the Escrow Account (or, if the Escrow Account is no longer in existence, pay
to the Paying Agent or as otherwise directed by the Stockholder
Representative), net of any out-of-pocket costs and Taxes incurred by Parent,
the Company, any Subsidiary or any other members of the Parent Group, the net
amount of such Tax refund (after offset against any then existing Tax
liability of the Company or any Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period).

 

(ii) To the extent a Tax refund that gave rise to a payment hereunder is
subsequently disallowed, or otherwise reduced or lost, the Parent shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Account for the amount of Taxes that
Parent, Newco the Company, or any Subsidiary incurs as a result of such
disallowance, reduction, or loss (and any related Losses).

 

(i) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement

 



49  shall be paid one-half by the Company Securityholders pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and one-half by Parent when due, and the Company Securityholders and

later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date such Tax is due to the
applicable Governmental Entity.

(k) _Conventions for Filing Tax Returns; Treatment of Indemnification
Payments_. For purposes of preparing Tax Returns, the Stockholder
Representative, Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that (i) to the
extent permissible under applicable Laws, the parties shall elect to have each
Tax period of the Company and any Subsidiary end on the Closing Date, and (ii)
unless otherwise required under applicable Law, all indemnification payments
under this Agreement shall be reported as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration for all relevant Tax purposes.

50  pursuant to the HSR Act and such other similar applicable competition,
antitrust or similar Laws of any other Governmental Entity, including by
promptly complying with any additional requests for information, including
requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions, by any competition or antitrust authority.

(d) Notwithstanding but without limiting the foregoing provisions of this

53 ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time, notwithstanding the approval thereof by the
stockholders of the Company at any time prior to Closing:

(a) by mutual consent of the Company, Parent and Newco;

(b) by either the Company or Parent and Newco, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before October 31, 2012 (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless extended by written agreement of the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger
under this paragraph shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or prior to such date;

(c) by either Parent or Newco, in the event that the conditions to its
obligations set forth in  _Article VI_ hereof have not been satisfied or
waived at or prior to the Termination Date;

(d) by the Company, in the event that the conditions to its obligations set
forth in _Article VI_ hereof have not been satisfied or waived at or prior to
the Termination Date;

(e) by the Company, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3_, in the event
that the Board of Directors of the Company receives a Superior Proposal;
provided that (i) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of
the material terms of the Superior Proposal and the Companys intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_, (ii) if requested
by Parent, the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent during a
period of three Business Days since the delivery of such notice to amend the
terms of this Agreement, and (iii) if Parent delivers a written, binding and
irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms
of the Agreement during such three Business Day period, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have concluded in good faith after consultation with the
Companys legal and financial advisors that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to change, qualify, withhold or withdraw its
recommendation that the Company accept the Superior Proposal would still be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. If, within the three Business Day period following
delivery of such notice, Parent makes an offer that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
legal and financial advisors is more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company than such Superior Proposal and agrees in writing to all adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are necessary to reflect such
offer, then the notice of intent to terminate pursuant to this _Section
7.1(e)_ shall be deemed rescinded and of no further force and effect;

(f) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof shall have effected a Change of Recommendation;

(g) by either Parent or Newco or the Company, if any Governmental Entity
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 



54 (h) by Parent, if (i) the Requisite Stockholders have not executed and
delivered to the Company written consents under Section 228 of DGCL
evidencing the Company Securityholder Approval by 9:00 p.m., Tampa, Florida
time, on the next calendar day after the date hereof, or (ii) the Company has
not delivered to Parent written confirmation thereof by such time on such
date.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof, all
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate and no party
shall have any liability to the other party, except for obligations of the
parties hereto in this _Section 7.2_ and the last sentence of _Section
5.1(a)_, which shall survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
however, that termination shall not preclude either party from suing the other
party for any breach of this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_, or (ii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ (and the failure of the
Companys obligations set forth in _Article VI_ to have been satisfied prior
to the Termination Date is a result of the Companys breach of, or failure to
perform, its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement), or (iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_, or
(iv) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ then, as Parents and Newcos sole
and exclusive remedy, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred on or prior
to the termination of this Agreement by Parent or Newco or on their behalf in
connection with or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein.

ARTICLE VIII

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations_. The representations and warranties
of the Company, Parent and Newco contained in this Agreement (whether or not
contained in _Articles III_ and _IV_ ) or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to _Article VI_  shall survive the Closing for a period of one year
after the Closing Date.

Section 8.2 _General Indemnification_. 

(a) For a period of one year after the Closing, if Parent, Newco and/or its
officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents (each a " _Parent
Indemnitee_ " and together the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") suffer any damages,
losses, liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind, interest or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (" _Loss_ ") as a result
of, in connection with, or arising out of (i) the breach of any representation
or warranty made by the Company contained (A) in _Article III_ of this
Agreement or (B) in any certificate delivered to Parent and Newco pursuant to
_Section 6.2,_ (ii) any breach by the Company of any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein which are to be performed by the Company on or
before the Closing Date, (iii) a breach of any covenant contained in _Section
5.10_ and (iv) the

 



55  exercise by any holder of Preferred Stock or Common Stock of their appraisal
rights, if any, under Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood that any
Loss in connection with this  _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ shall be net of the
Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration that such
holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of the Merger
hereunder), then, subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_ ,
such Parent Indemnitee(s) shall be entitled to be reimbursed the amount of
such Loss from the Escrow Account.

(b) For a period of one year after the Closing, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each of the Company Securityholders as of the date of this
Agreement and their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates
and/or agents (each a " _Stockholder Indemnitee_ " and together the "
_Stockholder Indemnitees_ ") harmless from any Loss suffered or paid,
directly or indirectly, as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of
(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Newco
contained (A) in _Article IV_ of this Agreement to be true and correct as of
the date of this Agreement or (B) in any certificate delivered to the Company
pursuant to _Section 6.3_, (ii) any breach by Parent or Newco of any of its
covenants or agreements contained herein, and (iii) any breach by the
Surviving Corporation (including by way of being the successor of Newco and
the Company) of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein which are
to be performed by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date. The
foregoing notwithstanding, in no event shall the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be liable hereunder for an amount in excess of $12,000,000.

(c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to clause (i) of
_Section 8.2(a)_ and pursuant to clause (i) of _Section 8.2(b)_ shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for the
period set forth in _Section 8.1_, except for claims for indemnification
pursuant to such clauses asserted prior to the end of such period which claims
shall survive until final resolution thereof.

(d) As used herein, the term " _Indemnification Claim_ " means a claim for
indemnification by Parent or any other Parent Indemnitee or any Stockholder
Indemnitee, as the case may be, for any Loss under this _Article VIII_ (such
Person making an Indemnification Claim, an " _Indemnitee_ "). An Indemnitee
may give notice of an Indemnification Claim under this Agreement, whether for
its own Loss or for Losses incurred by any other Parent Indemnitee or
Stockholder Indemnitee, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such
Indemnification Claim executed by an officer of Parent or the Stockholder
Representative, as applicable (a " _Notice of Claim"_ ), and delivered to the
Stockholder Representative or Parent, as applicable (such receiving party, the
" _Indemnitor_ "), promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the
existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ , but in any event before the Escrow Release Date, arising
out of or resulting from:

 

(i) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Sections 8.2(a)_ or
_8.2(b)_ ; or

 

(ii) the assertion in writing, against any Indemnitee of a claim, demand,
suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a
third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_
") that results from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Sections
8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_. 

 



56 (e) So long as such Notice of Claim is given on or prior to the Escrow Release
Date, no delay on the part of an Indemnitee in giving the Indemnitor a Notice
of Claim shall limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder,
nor relieve the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this _Article
VIII_, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is (or the
Company Securityholders are, in the case of a Notice of Claim on behalf of an
Parent Indemnitee) prejudiced thereby.

 

Section 8.3 _Third Party Claims_.

(a) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") is made against any person or entity entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ hereof (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), and if such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this
_Article VIII_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party
obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Parent
Indemnitee seeking indemnification, such Parent Indemnitee shall promptly
notify Stockholder Representative) (such notified party, the " _Responsible
Party_ ") of such claims;  _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not
relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Responsible Party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. The Responsible Party shall have 30 days after receipt of such
notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Responsible Party,
of the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ that (i) the
Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party and
(ii) the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Responsible Party shall be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee if
and only to the extent that representation of the Responsible Party and the
Indemnitee by the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of such
counsel, constitute a conflict of interest under applicable standards of
professional conduct. So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay
or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim, provided that in
such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible
Party or from the Escrow Account, as the case may be, for such claim unless
the Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement. If
the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of indemnity
hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this
Agreement. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or persons asserting such
claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all
liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

 

(b) All of the parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



57 Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the
Parent Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section
8.2(a)_ other than with respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation are
subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) the amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of (i) any amounts
recovered or reasonably expected to be recovered by the Parent Indemnitees
under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as contractual
indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with
respect to such Losses and (ii) any Tax benefits realized with respect to
such Losses in accordance with the principles of _Section 5.10(g)_;

(b) in valuing a Loss, no adjustment shall be made as a result of any
multiple, increase factor, or any other premium over fair market value, book
or historical value which may have been paid by Parent and/or Newco in
connection with the valuation of the Company Securities for purposes of the
Merger whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been
used by Parent and/or Newco at the time of, or in connection with, calculating
or preparing their bid or in calculating the Enterprise Value or the final
Purchase Price;

(c) in no event shall Loss include any consequential, indirect, lost profits,
punitive and exemplary damages (other than to the extent consequential,
indirect, punitive or exemplary damages are paid in a Third Party Claim);

(d) the Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ until the total amount which the Parent Indemnitees would
recover under clause (i) of _Section 8.2(a)_ (as limited by the provisions
of  _Sections 8.4(a)_ and _8.4(e)_ ), but for this _Section 8.4(d)_, exceeds
One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,250,000.00) (the
" _Deductible_ ") and then only for the excess over the Deductible;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the foregoing limitation in this _Section 8.4(d)_ shall not apply
in respect of Losses arising out of _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ or any breach by
the Company of _Sections 3.2_ or _5.10(a)_ ;

(e) Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ if (i) Parent could have mitigated or prevented such Loss
(including seeking indemnification or other redress pursuant to the terms of
any contract to which the Company is a party and by which the Company has the
right to seek indemnification from any third party), or (ii) such Loss is due
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation filing a Tax return, or taking a
position for Tax purposes, that is inconsistent with a position taken on
a Tax return that was filed on or before the Closing Date; and

(f) at any time the Parent Indemnitees (x) will be entitled to recover no
more than the amount of cash then in the Escrow Account and (y) pursuant to
this Agreement, will not be entitled to recover Losses from any source other
than the Escrow Account.

 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, after the Closing,
on the date that the amount of cash in the Escrow Account is reduced to zero,
the Parent Indemnitees shall have no further rights to indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ , other than for claims of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

 



58 Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, other than in the case of common law fraud
relating to entry into this Agreement or intentional misrepresentation, after
the Closing (i) indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be the exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for any
misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other provision
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) making a claim for a proper distribution from the Escrow
Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Parent
Indemnitees for any Loss, Losses or other amounts (including any relating to
environmental, health or safety matters or Tax matters) arising under the
indemnification obligations set forth herein, or otherwise in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 8.6 _Stockholder Representative_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Stockholder Representative is a party to this Agreement solely
in its role of representative of the Company Securityholders according to the
terms of _Article IX_ hereof. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to, and
shall not be liable for any Losses of, to any party hereto or to any Parent
Indemnitee in connection with any obligations of the Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to
the extent such Losses shall be proven to be the direct result of willful
misconduct by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the
performance of its obligations hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement.

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Company Securityholders or any
of them and/or the Stockholder Representative arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_
, however, that no such failure to act on the part of the Stockholder
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
the Stockholder Representative or by the Company Securityholders unless
such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Stockholder
Representative; and

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Stockholder
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other
agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed
in connection herewith and therewith.

 



60 All of the aforementioned actions shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside the Merger Agreement and shall be binding on the Company
Securityholders as a matter of contract law.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to the payment of all
its expenses incurred as the Stockholder Representative. In connection with
the foregoing, at the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall transfer
$300,000 (the " _Expense Funds_ ") to the Stockholder Representative, to be
used by Stockholder Representative to pay expenses incurred by Stockholder
Representative in its capacity as Stockholder Representative. The Company
Securityholders will not receive interest or other earnings on the Expense
Funds and the Company Securityholders irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may have in any
interest that may accrue on funds held in the Expense Fund. The Company
Securityholders acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The
Stockholder Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for any
loss of principal of the Expense Funds other than as a result of its willful
misconduct. For tax purposes, the Expense Funds shall be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Securityholders at the
time of Closing. Once the Stockholder Representative determines, in its sole
discretion, that the Stockholder Representative will not incur any additional
expenses in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative, then the
Stockholder Representative will appropriately distribute the remaining unused
Expense Funds, if any, to the Company Securityholders (either directly or
through a third party paying agent), except in the case of payments to
employees or former employees of the Company for which employment tax
withholding is required, which such amounts shall be delivered to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation and paid through Parents or Surviving Corporations
payroll processing service or system. In connection with this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or
thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers
conferred upon the Stockholder Representative hereunder (i) the Stockholder
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Company
Securityholders by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission
performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow Agreement or
any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct, and (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to rely
on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent
experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or
other act or omission of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to such
advice shall in no event subject the Stockholder Representative to liability
to any Company Securityholders. Each Company Securityholder shall indemnify,
pro rata based upon such holders share (excluding all Dissenting Shares) of
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Closing (on a fully-diluted, as-converted basis excluding all Dissenting
Shares but including all Options), the Stockholder Representative against all
losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the
amount of any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but
not limited to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced
or threatened or any claims

 



61  whatsoever) (" _Representative Losses_ "), arising out of or in connection
with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement (including any claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding
or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of
the Stockholder Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or
otherwise), in each case as such Representative Loss is incurred or suffered.
In the event of any action or proceeding which finally adjudicates that any
Representative Loss was primarily caused by the willful misconduct or
the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse
the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
attributable to such willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification
hereunder, upon written notice from the Stockholder Representative to the
Company Securityholders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment
of any such indemnification amount, each Company Securityholder shall promptly
deliver to the Stockholder Representative full payment of his or her ratable
share of the amount of such deficiency based upon such holders share
(excluding all Dissenting Shares) of the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (on a fully-diluted, as-
converted basis excluding all Dissenting Shares but including all Options). If
not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company
Securityholders, any such Representative Loss may be recovered by
the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Funds and
(ii) the amounts in the Escrow Account otherwise distributable to the Company
Securityholders pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the
time of distribution in accordance with written instructions delivered by the
Stockholder Representative to the Escrow Agent; provided that while this
section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Expense
Funds and the Escrow Funds, this does not relieve the Company Securityholders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

(c) Each Company Securityholder acknowledges and agrees that each of (i)
Stolberg, Meehan and Scano II, L.P. (or its designee) and (ii) 5280 Partners I,
LP (or its designee) (collectively, the " _Advisory Committee Stockholders_ ")
shall be designated to an advisory committee (the " _Advisory Committee_ ")
that shall have the power to direct, instruct and advise, and take all other
actions as they shall deem necessary or advisable with respect to, the
Stockholder Representative in connection with the fulfillment of its duties
hereunder and under any engagement agreement between the Company and the
Stockholder Representative (the " _Covered Activities_ "). Each of the
Advisory Committee Stockholders is authorized and empowered to act as a
representative for the benefit of the each Company Securityholder as the
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact with the power and authority to act on
behalf of each holder of Company Equity Securities in connection with or
related to the Covered Activities. In connection therewith, the
Advisory Committee Stockholders shall not incur any responsibility whatsoever
to any other Company Securityholders by reason of any error in judgment or
other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the
Covered Activities, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to
act which represents willful misconduct. Each Company Securityholder shall
indemnify, pro rata based upon such holders share (excluding all Dissenting
Shares) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing (on a fully-diluted, as-converted basis excluding all
Dissenting Shares but including all Options), the Advisory Committee
Stockholders against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys,

 



62  accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against
them, of any nature whatsoever (including any and all expense whatsoever
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever) (" _Advisory
Committee Stockholder Losses_ "), arising out of or in connection with any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Advisory Committee Stockholders
in connection with the Covered Activities, in each case as such Advisory
Committee Stockholder Loss is incurred or suffered. In the event of any action
or proceeding which finally adjudicates that any Advisory Committee
Stockholder Loss was primarily caused by the willful misconduct or the
Advisory Committee Stockholders, the Advisory Committee Stockholders will
reimburse the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Advisory
Committee Stockholder Loss attributable to such willful misconduct. In the
event of any indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Advisory
Committee Stockholders to the Company Securityholders as to the existence of a
deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification amount, each
Company Securityholder shall promptly deliver to the Advisory Committee
Stockholders full payment of his or her ratable share of the amount of such
deficiency based upon such holders share (excluding all Dissenting Shares)
of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Closing (on a fully-diluted, as-converted basis excluding all Dissenting
Shares but including all Options).

 

(d) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Stockholder
Representative or the Advisory Committee Stockholders under this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Date and/or any termination of this Agreement
and/or the Escrow Agreement.

(e) If the Stockholder Representative shall have resigned, died or is
otherwise become incapacitated or removed, Company Securityholders who in the
aggregate hold at least a majority of the interest in the Escrow Account shall
appoint, subject to the prior approval of the Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld), a successor stockholder representative not later than
30 days following the resignation, death, incapacity or removal of the
Stockholder Representative.

 

(f) Parent and Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all of which actions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon the Company Securityholders.

(g) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any holder of Company Equity Securities; and (ii) shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void. Subject

their respective heirs, successors, assigns and legal representatives, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder.

 



65 Section 10.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or

Section 10.8 _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of

the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the
parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity,
to enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only
by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security).

Section 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto waives any

hereto.

 

Section 10.14 _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
parties exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

 



66 Section 10.15 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, by action taken by the respective boards of directors
of the Company, Parent and Newco. This Agreement (including the provisions of
