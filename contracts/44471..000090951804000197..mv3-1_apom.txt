           AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 27, 2004 (this
"AGREEMENT"), among GMI Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"),
GMI Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("PURCHASER"), and Guilford Mills, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in Section
8.11.

           WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company each deems it advisable that Parent acquire the Company on the terms
and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement;

           WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Purchaser's
willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into
stockholder support agreements with Parent and Purchaser (the "STOCKHOLDER
SUPPORT AGREEMENTS");

           WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof it is proposed that such acquisition
be accomplished by (a) Purchaser commencing a tender offer to purchase all of
the shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON
STOCK") issued and outstanding (each, a "SHARE" and, collectively, the "Shares")
for $19.00 per Share (such amount or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant
to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "OFFER PRICE"), subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash, on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such cash tender
offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement,
the "OFFER"), and (b) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of
Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), pursuant to which Shares (other than certain Shares as
provided in Sections 2.7(a) and (b)) will be converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (the "Merger");

           WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent (on its own
behalf and as the sole stockholder of Purchaser), Purchaser and the Company have
each approved this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger; and

           WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness
to enter into this Agreement, Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., on behalf of
one or more of its affiliated funds or managed accounts (the "GUARANTOR" ), has
entered into a letter agreement whereby the Guarantor has agreed to be liable
for the failure by Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on the terms and subject to the limitations set forth therein.

           NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:


                                       2
<PAGE>
                             ARTICLE I - THE OFFER

           1.1 The Offer.

           (a) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "EXCHANGE
ACT")) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at the Offer Price as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later than five business days after the
public announcement of the execution of this Agreement. The obligation of
Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject only to (x) the satisfaction of the condition that at the
expiration of the Offer there be validly tendered in accordance with the terms
of the Offer and not withdrawn that number of Shares which, when taken together
with Shares (if any) then owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, represents
more than 50% of the Shares then outstanding determined on a fully-diluted basis
(on a "FULLY-DILUTED BASIS" meaning the number of Shares then issued and
outstanding plus all shares of Company Common Stock which the Company may be
required to issue as of such date pursuant to options, warrants, convertible
securities or similar obligations then outstanding) (the "MINIMUM CONDITION"),
and (y) the satisfaction (or waiver by Purchaser) of the other conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of
such conditions to the extent legally permissible (other than the Minimum
Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any
other changes in the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that no change may
be made without the prior written consent of the Company which (i) decreases the
price per Share payable in the Offer, (ii) changes the form of consideration to
be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto, (v) waives the Minimum Condition, (vi)
modifies or amends any of the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto or makes
other changes in the terms of the Offer that are in any manner adverse to the
holders of Shares or (vii) except as provided below, extends the expiration date
of the Offer.

           (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, (i) extend the Offer beyond the initial scheduled expiration
date, which shall be 20 business days following the date of commencement of the
Offer, or any subsequent scheduled expiration date, if, at the scheduled
expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to
accept for payment and to pay for Shares tendered shall not be satisfied or, to
the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived, subject, however, to the
parties' respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1,
and (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation or
interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer. Any extension of the Offer pursuant to
clause (i) of the preceding sentence of this Section 1.1(b) shall, subject to
Section 7.1, not exceed the lesser of five business days (or such longer period
as the Company and Purchaser may agree in writing in any particular instance) or
such fewer number of days that Purchaser reasonably believes are necessary to
cause the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto to be satisfied.


                                       3
<PAGE>
In addition, if, at the expiration date of the Offer, all of the conditions to
the Offer have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement,
waived by Purchaser) but the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer, when taken together with Shares, if any, then owned by
Parent and its subsidiaries, constitutes less than 90% of the Shares then
outstanding, Purchaser shall (subject to applicable Law) provide for a
"subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act) of at least five but no more than 20 business days after Purchaser's
acceptance for payment of the Shares then tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer, in which event Purchaser shall (A) give the required notice of such
subsequent offering period and (B) immediately accept for payment and promptly
pay for all Shares tendered and not withdrawn as of such expiration date.

           (c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the satisfaction or
earlier waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto as
of any expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after it is permitted to do so under
applicable Law (but in no event later than the next business day after such
expiration date of the Offer). On or prior to the date that Purchaser becomes
obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall provide or cause
to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary to pay for all Shares that
Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price
shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, be net to the seller in
cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

           (d) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of
transmittal and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with
all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Parent
and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders
of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser shall cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents before they are filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares. In addition, Parent and
Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments,
whether written or oral, that Parent or Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments, to consult with the Company and its


                                       4
<PAGE>
counsel prior to responding to any such comments and to provide the Company with
copies of all such responses, whether written or oral.

           1.2 Company Actions.

           (a) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") which, subject to Section 5.2, shall
contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company referred to
in clause (ii) of Section 3.3(b). The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
be mailed to holders of the Shares together with the Offer Documents. The
Company, on the one hand, and each of Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares. In addition, the Company agrees to
provide Parent and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that
the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments, to consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such
comments and to provide Parent with copies of all such responses, whether
written or oral.

           (b) The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and
beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser with such
additional information, including updated listings and computer files of
stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
assistance as Parent, Purchaser or their agents may reasonably require in
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in
confidence pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement the information contained
in such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1 or if the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall
promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company all copies of such
information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or control or
in the possession or control of their agents or representatives.

           1.3 Directors of the Company.

           (a) Upon the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and for so long
thereafter as Parent and its subsidiaries own in the aggregate more than 50% of
the outstanding Shares, Parent shall be entitled to designate for appointment or
election to the Company's Board of Directors, upon written notice to the
Company, such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is
equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of directors on
such Board (after giving effect to the directors designated by Parent pursuant
to this sentence) by the percentage that the number of Shares so owned by Parent
and its subsidiaries bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. In
furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of Parent, use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly cause Parent's designees (and any
replacement designees in the event that any designee shall no longer be on such
Board of Directors) to be so appointed or elected to the Company's Board of
Directors and, in furtherance thereof, to the extent necessary, increase the
size of such Board of Directors or use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
resignation of such number of its directors as is necessary to give effect to
the foregoing provision. At such time, the Company shall also, upon the request
of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause such persons designated by
Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the Company's Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the
Company's Board of Directors subject to compliance with applicable securities
laws and (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each subsidiary of
the Company and each committee of each such board (or similar body).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have at least one director who is a director of the Company
on the date of this Agreement and who is not an officer of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (the "INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR"); provided, however, that (x)
notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the requirement to have at
least one Independent Director result in Parent's designees constituting less
than a majority of the directors on the Company's Board of Directors unless
Parent shall have failed to designate a sufficient number of persons to
constitute at least a majority.

           (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order
to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to the
Company's stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9 if it
receives from Parent and Purchaser the information below on a basis timely to
permit such mailing) as is necessary to fulfill the Company's obligations under
Section 1.3(a). The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the
Company's Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to
compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder and to Parent's compliance with its obligations under the following
sentence. Parent and Purchaser shall supply the Company such information with
respect to Parent and Purchaser and their nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary in


                                       6
<PAGE>
connection with the appointment of any of Parent's designees under Section
1.3(a), and Parent and Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the accuracy
and completeness of such information.

           (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by
affirmative vote or written consent of all of the Independent Directors then in
office (or, if there shall be only one Independent Director then in office, the
Independent Director) (the "INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR APPROVAL") shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Company's Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any other committee thereof or any other director of the
Company, shall, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, be required or
permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by
the Company, (ii) any extension by the Company of time for performance of any
obligation or action under this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser, (iii) any
waiver, exercise or enforcement of any of the Company's rights under this
Agreement or (iv) any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company.

           1.4 Stockholder Meeting.

           (a) As promptly as practicable following the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, if required by applicable Law in order to consummate the
Merger, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws:

                      (i) (A) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an
           annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders for the
           purposes of obtaining the Stockholder Approval (the "COMPANY
           STOCKHOLDERS MEETING"); or (B) at the election of the Company, obtain
           the Stockholder Approval by written consent in lieu of a meeting
           pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL; and

                      (ii) in consultation with Parent, prepare and file with
           the SEC a preliminary proxy or information statement relating to the
           Merger and this Agreement and obtain and furnish the information
           required by the SEC to be included therein and, after consultation
           with Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with
           respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement and cause a
           definitive proxy or information statement (together with all
           amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "PROXY STATEMENT")
           to be mailed to the Company's stockholders at the earliest
           practicable date; provided that no amendments or supplements to the
           Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without consultation
           with Parent. Parent shall provide the Company with such information
           with respect to Parent and its affiliates as shall be required to be
           included in the Proxy Statement.

           (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.4(a), in the event
that Parent, Purchaser and any other subsidiaries of Parent shall acquire in the
aggregate at least 90% of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer or


                                       7
<PAGE>
otherwise, the parties hereto shall, subject to Article VI, take all necessary
and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

           (c) Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees that it will execute a
written consent or vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares acquired in the
Offer or otherwise then owned by it, Purchaser or any of Parent's other
subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

           1.5 Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement. Without
limiting any other provision of this Agreement, whenever any party hereto
becomes aware of any event or change which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and/or the
Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other parties thereof and
each of the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, filing with the SEC and
(as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws)
dissemination to the Company's stockholders of such amendment or supplement.


                            ARTICLE II - THE MERGER

           2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time
Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Purchaser shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the

parties, which date shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another time or date,
or both, are agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the
Closing is held is herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE". The Closing will be
held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York,

the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL
in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing

                                       8
<PAGE>
           2.4 Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

           2.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit
2.5 hereto and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation and by-laws
shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (and subject to Section 5.7).

           2.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The
directors of Purchaser and the officers of the Company, respectively,
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

           2.7 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of
Purchaser or the Company:

           (a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Purchaser,
and any Share owned by a subsidiary of the Company or a subsidiary of Parent
other than Purchaser, shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $.0l par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

           (b) Any Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and
any Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser, shall be automatically canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

           (c) Each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares to be
converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
Section 2.7(a), (ii) Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.7(b) and
(iii) any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to the Offer Price payable to the holder thereof upon
surrender, in the manner provided in this Agreement, of the certificate formerly
representing such Share, without interest (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). All such
Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the


                                       9
<PAGE>
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with this Agreement, without interest.

           2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

           (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for
the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the "PAYING AGENT") to
receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of
holders of Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c). Parent shall deposit such
aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the
Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying
Agent in such investments as may be instructed by Purchaser. Parent shall
promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any
investment made pursuant to this paragraph.

           (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event more than three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "CERTIFICATES"), whose shares were converted pursuant to
Section 2.7(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Article II, without interest.


                                       10
<PAGE>
           (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the
close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to Section
2.8(e), if, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

           (d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article II.

           (e) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

           (f) Withholding Taxes. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
Merger such amounts as Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of


                                       11
<PAGE>
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"),
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are
so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

           2.9 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who did not vote in favor of
the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who comply with all of the
relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS")
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the "DISSENTING SHARES"), unless and until the holder or
holders thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holder's Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with
Section 2.7, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal,
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle, or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

           2.10 Company Stock Options. Prior to the Purchase Date, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to provide that each option outstanding
immediately prior to the Purchase Date (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
(each, an "OPTION") shall be cancelled and converted at the Purchase Date into
the right to receive from the Company a cash amount equal to the Option
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option.
The Option Consideration shall be paid as soon after the Purchase Date as shall
be practicable (but in no event later than the next business day after the
Purchase Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration otherwise payable such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment or the vesting of the Option under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. All unexercised Options as of the Purchase Date
that have an exercise price equal to or exceeding the Offer Price on the
Purchase Date shall be immediately cancelled and forfeited. Prior to the
Purchase Date, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Stock
Plans and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from holders of
Options that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.10. For purposes of this Agreement, "OPTION
CONSIDERATION" means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable


                                       12
<PAGE>
under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
Offer Price per Share over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such
share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option. For purposes of this
Agreement, "STOCK PLANS" shall mean the following plans of the Company: the
Guilford Mills, Inc. Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors and the
Guilford Mills, Inc. 2003 Stock Option Plan and any other stock option plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest
in respect of the capital stock or equity of the Company.

           2.11 Rule 16b-3. Parent and the Company shall take such steps as may
be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in accordance with that
certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such
matters.


          ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

           The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that,
except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE"):

           3.1 Organization.

           (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws as amended to date (the "COMPANY
CHARTER DOCUMENTS"). The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned
or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on
the Company or would not reasonably be expected to prevent the Company's
performance of its obligations under this Agreement (a "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT"). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"
shall mean, with respect to any party, an effect, event or change which has a
material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, other
than effects, events or changes arising out of or resulting from (i) changes in
conditions in the U.S. or global economy or capital or financial markets
generally, including changes in interest or exchange rates, (ii) changes in
general legal, regulatory, political, economic or business conditions or changes
in generally accepted accounting principles, (iii) the identity of Parent or its
affiliates or acts of, or communications by, Parent or its affiliates, including


                                       13
<PAGE>
the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,
suppliers, distributors, partners or employees, or (iv) any decline in the
market price, or change in trading volume, of the capital stock of such party or
any failure to meet publicly announced revenue or earnings projections.

           (b) Each of the Company's subsidiaries listed on Section 3.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (an "ACTIVE SUBSIDIARY") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy
of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws as amended to date (or
comparable documents) of each active subsidiary. Each active subsidiary is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Other than for the active subsidiaries, the
Company does not have any subsidiaries that carry on significant business
activities.

           3.2 Capitalization.

           (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
11,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business on February
23, 2004, there were 5,501,053 Shares issued and outstanding, and no Shares were
held by the Company in its treasury. As of February 23, 2004, there were 172,000
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding options under the Stock Plans. All Shares have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. Except as set forth above or as permitted by Section 5.1, the Company
has not issued any shares of its capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests (other than pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options) or any
options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities or rights providing
for the issuance of any shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests of the Company, including any representing the right to purchase
Company Common Stock, phantom stock rights, stock appreciation right or stock
based performance units. Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
includes a list of all outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock and
the related exercise prices thereof.

           (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (i) the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock, voting securities and equity interests of
each of its subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges or
security interests (except for such transfer restrictions of general
applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and
other applicable securities laws), and all of such shares, securities and


                                       14
<PAGE>
interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, (ii) none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has issued
any outstanding options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities,
rights or other agreements providing for the issuance or disposition of any
shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity interests of any subsidiary
of the Company, and (iii) there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock, voting securities or equity interests (or any options, warrants
or other rights to acquire any shares of capital stock, voting securities or
equity interests) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

           3.3 Authority.

           (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the approval of its
stockholders to the adoption of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 1.4
(to the extent required by the DGCL), to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by it of the Transactions, have
been duly authorized and approved by its Board of Directors and, except for
obtaining the approval of its stockholders to the adoption of this Agreement as
contemplated by Section 1.4 (to the extent required by the DGCL), no other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by it of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the "BANKRUPTCY AND EQUITY
EXCEPTION").

           (b) The Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and
held, has duly adopted resolutions (i) determining that the terms of the Offer
and the Merger are fair from a financial point of view to the Company and the
holders of the Shares (ii) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and
the Transactions and (iii) resolving (subject to Section 5.2) to recommend that
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser
pursuant thereto and adopt this Agreement. The Company has taken all actions
such that no restrictive provision of Section 203 of the DGCL is, or at the
expiration of the Offer or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the
Transactions.

           (c) The affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement (the "STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL") is the only vote or

the part of Parent and Purchaser is necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the
consummation by them of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation

Purchaser of the Transactions, other than such other consents, approvals,
filings, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given,
would not reasonably be expected to (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
or (B) prevent or materially delay Parent's or Purchaser's performance of their
respective obligations under this Agreement ("PARENT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT").
The foregoing representation and warranty (to the extent relating to antitrust

first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may
be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement (if any) will not, on the date the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of the Company,

necessary to take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company receives an
unsolicited Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consulting with a legal advisor of national reputation and with a financial
advisor of national reputation, determines in good faith constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that it is necessary to
take the following actions to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then the Company may (A) furnish non-public information to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal and (B) participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person regarding a Takeover Proposal, in each case
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms and conditions
no more favorable to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (and the Company shall provide Parent and Purchaser with the same
waivers of, and modifications to, the Confidentiality Agreement as those made
available to any other Person).

                                       33

           (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(b), neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A)
withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the approval by such Board of Directors described in clause
(ii) of Section 3.3(b) or the recommendation by such Board of Directors
described in clause (iii) of Section 3.3(b) or (B) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) cause or
authorize the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any contract or
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement) with respect to a Takeover
Proposal (a "COMPANY ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding the foregoing the
Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify its recommendation
described in clause (ii) of Section 3.3(b) if the Board determines in good
faith, after reviewing applicable provisions of state law and after consulting
with a legal advisor of national reputation, that such action is necessary for
the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
In addition, subject to compliance with the Company's obligations under Section
5.2(a), if the Board of Directors of the Company receives a Takeover Proposal
that it determines in good faith, after consultation with a legal advisor of
national reputation and a financial advisor of national reputation, constitutes
a Superior Proposal and that it is necessary to take the following actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of
the Company may enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal if (I) the Company provides written notice to Parent, which
notice must be received by Parent at least three business days (inclusive of the
day of receipt by Parent of such notice) prior to the time it intends to cause
the Company to enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement, advising Parent
that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Takeover Proposal
which it believes constitutes a Superior Proposal and intends to accept and,
with respect to which, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, subject to
the provisions of this Section 5.2(b), providing a copy of any written offer or
proposal describing the Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal, (II) as of the end of such three business day period
referenced above, Parent shall have failed to revise the terms of the Offer and
the Merger to an extent necessary to cause the Board of Directors to change its
determination that such Takeover Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal,
and (III) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii)
within three business days after the lapse of the three business day period
referenced above, concurrently enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal and pays the Termination Fee to Parent in
accordance with Section 7.3(b).

           (c) For purposes of this Agreement:

                      "TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
           from any Person (other than Parent and its subsidiaries) relating to
           any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
           transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the
           Company and its subsidiaries (including securities of subsidiaries,
           but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business)
           equal to 20% or more of the Company's consolidated assets or to which


                                       34
<PAGE>
           20% or more of the Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated
           basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether
           in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 20%
           or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (C) tender
           offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
           Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
           securities of the Company or (D) merger, consolidation, share
           exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
           dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or involving
           any subsidiary (or subsidiaries) or any assets of the Company and its
           subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the Company's consolidated
           assets or to which 20% or more of the Company's revenues or earnings
           on a consolidated basis are attributable; in each case, other than
           the Transactions.

                      "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a proposal to acquire, directly
           or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
           securities, more than 50% of any class of equity securities of the
           Company or a substantial portion of the assets (which may include
           securities of subsidiaries) of the Company and its subsidiaries on a
           consolidated basis, made by a third party, which is on terms and
           conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
           its good faith and reasonable judgment (after consultation with a
           financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the
           Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the
           Transactions, taking into account at the time of determination the
           ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the
           transactions contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among other
           things, the availability of financing and the expectation of
           obtaining required approvals).

           (d) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under
the Exchange Act if such Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a
violation of applicable Law. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for
purposes of this Agreement (including Sections 5.2(b) and 7.1(d)), a factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Company's receipt of
a Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed a withdrawal or modification, or proposal by the Board of
Directors of the Company to withdraw or modify, such Board's recommendation of
this Agreement or the Transactions, or a recommendation with respect to such
Takeover Proposal.

           5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.

           (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall each cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause
their respective subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly (i) take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable, including


                                       35
<PAGE>
preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Entity or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to (x)
take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions,
take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in addition to
Section 5.3(c), the Company and Parent shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries or Parent and its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Transactions. For purposes hereof, "ANTITRUST LAWS" means
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws
and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Entity that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

           (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make appropriate filings under Foreign Antitrust Laws as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the date required, and to
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be required in connection therewith. The Company and Parent
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to
any of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of
such Law on the Transactions.

           (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission with a Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed
in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to any
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in


                                       36
<PAGE>
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the Transactions.

           (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 5.3, each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions, on or before
the Walk-Away Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the
consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in
any event no later than the Walk-Away Date) including, with respect to Parent,
Parent shall take all such actions, including (y) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of
Parent (or any of its subsidiaries) and (z) otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit Parent or its subsidiaries' freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiaries'
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case, as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
required to take any such actions which would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on Parent or its
affiliates (including for this purpose the Surviving Corporation as subsidiary
of Parent). The Company shall take such of the foregoing actions as Parent may
request; provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger.

           (e) Financing. Upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Parent in
obtaining third-party financing to pay or refinance all or a portion of the
financing for the Transactions contemplated hereby, including all amounts due or
to become due under the Note Agreement and Credit Agreement. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its auditors to continue to
provide executed audit opinions for prior periods following the Purchase Date.

           5.4 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company nor
Parent shall, without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued
or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions, except for any such press


                                       37
<PAGE>
release or public announcement as may be required by Law as determined in the
good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release or announcement
(in which case the party proposing to make such release or announcement shall,
to the extent practicable, consult with the other party prior to making such
release or announcement). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the provisions of this
Section 5.4 shall be subject to Section 5.5(b).

           5.5 Access; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees and
other representatives of Parent, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, reasonable access to its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees and other
representatives and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities laws and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information to the extent the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege. Until the Effective Time, the information provided
will be (i) used solely in connection with the Transactions and (ii) subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as November 25, 2003 between
Parent and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

           5.6 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions.

           5.7 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

           (a) From and after the Purchase Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume all
obligations of the Company, and cause its subsidiaries to maintain in effect all
such obligations owed by them, to each individual who at the Effective Time is,
or any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "INDEMNITEES") in respect of
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (x) the Company Charter
Documents (or predecessor documents) and the organizational documents of such
subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall survive
the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their


                                       38
<PAGE>
respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions no less
favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of
this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee in connection
with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
5.7 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided
that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

           (b) Following the Purchase Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to purchase a six-year "tail" with respect to the Company's existing
current directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time
become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable
to such persons than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. In the
event that the Surviving Corporation does not purchase the "tail" referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence, then, for the six-year period commencing
immediately after the Purchase Date, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior
to the Effective Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, not less favorable to such persons than those of such policy in effect
on the date hereof (or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time); provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than
an amount per year equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company,
whether expended over time or paid in a lump sum or otherwise, to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 5.7; and, provided, further,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain or to cause to be obtained a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

           (c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.7 applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y)


                                       39
<PAGE>
the affected Indemnitee shall have consented expressly in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.7). The provisions of this Section 5.7 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise.

           (d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth
in this Section 5.7.

           5.8 Employee Matters.

           (a) Parent shall, for a period of at least one year immediately
following the Purchase Date, cause the Company, and from and after the Effective
Date, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective subsidiaries to provide
for each employee of the Company and its subsidiaries (each, a "COMPANY
EMPLOYEE"), for so long as each such Company Employee remains employed with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective successor(s) after the
Purchase Date, with employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than similar employee benefit
plans, programs, contracts and arrangements provided by the Company and its
subsidiaries to Company Employees immediately prior to the Purchase Date.

           (b) Parent or one of its affiliates shall recognize, to the extent
credited for such purposes by the Company prior to the Closing Date, the service
of Company Employees with the Company prior to the Closing Date as service with
Parent and its affiliates in connection with any retirement plan, whether or not
tax-qualified, 401(k) savings plan, welfare benefit plans and policies
(including vacations and holiday policies) maintained by Parent or one of its
affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent or one
of its affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, participation or
eligibility to receive benefits based on years of service (but excluding benefit
accruals); provided, however, that with respect to any defined benefit pension
plan maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates in which such Company
Employee participates following the Closing Date, such service credit shall be
measured from the earliest date that such employee commenced participation in a
tax-qualified pension or savings plan maintained by the Company or one of its
affiliates.

           (c) Parent shall (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive,
all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under
any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made


                                       40
<PAGE>
available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of
its affiliates, and (ii) provide credit, to the extent credited for such
purposes by the Company prior to the Closing Date, to Company Employees for any
co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under
the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the Company and its
subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing
Date.

           (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
the termination of employment of any individual Company Employee or, subject to
Parent's compliance with Section 5.8(a), any change in the employee benefits
available to any individual Company Employee or the amendment or termination of
any particular Employee Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Purchase Date; provided, however, that Parent
hereby agrees to cause the Company, and from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation to honor, comply with and perform all of the respective
terms and obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the collective
bargaining agreements and other arrangements set forth on Section 5.8(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case, as in effect as of the Purchase Date.

           (e) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, extend the date on which the Company may give notice
of termination of the salary continuation agreements listed on Section 5.8(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to November 12, 2005. Parent and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that the Board of Directors of the Company has the sole
discretion to determine the amount of the awards and the recipients under the
discretionary bonus program agreements, dated January 7, 2004, listed in Section
5.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to the limitations set forth
therein.

           5.9 Obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Note Agreement.
Parent agrees to cause the Company and its subsidiaries to honor and comply with
the terms and conditions of, and to perform their respective obligations under,
the Credit Agreement and the Note Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
simultaneously with the first acceptance of Shares for purchase pursuant to the
Offer, Parent shall, or shall cause Purchaser to, make available to the Company
the funds necessary (i) to pay the aggregate Option Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.10, (ii) to pay for any and all amounts due and payable under
Section 7.3 or any other provision of the Note Agreement as a result of the
consummation of any of the Transactions and (iii) to pay for any and all amounts
due and payable if an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is
deemed to exist under Article 7 of the Credit Agreement because consents to the
Transactions by the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall
not have been obtained.

           5.10 Purchase of Company Debt Prior to the Purchase Date.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any prior agreement to the contrary, including
the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and any of their affiliates may
purchase all or any portion of the Company's outstanding obligations under the


                                       41
<PAGE>
Note Agreement, provided that, prior to any such purchase, Parent and Purchaser
shall confirm to the Company in writing that Parent and Purchaser have
irrevocably waived any unsatisfied conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A,
other than the Minimum Condition.


                     ARTICLE VI - CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

           6.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law) at

           (a) The Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, if and to the
extent required by applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation of the
Company, in order to consummate the Merger;

           (b) No Law, injunction, judgment or ruling enacted, promulgated,
issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental Entity shall be in
effect enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Merger or making the consummation of the Merger illegal; and

           (c) Purchaser shall have purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer,
provided that this condition shall be deemed satisfied with respect to Parent
and Purchaser if Purchaser shall have failed to purchase Shares pursuant to the
Offer in breach of its obligations under this Agreement.


                           ARTICLE VII - TERMINATION

           7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after Stockholder Approval thereof:

           (a) By the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly
authorized by the respective Boards of Directors of the Company (including, from
and after the Purchase Date, the Independent Director Approval contemplated by
Section 1.3) and Parent.

           (b) By either of the Company or Parent:

                      (i) if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted,
           promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced (A) a Law
           prohibiting the Offer or the Merger or making the Offer or the Merger
           illegal, or (B) an injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling, or
           taken any other action, in each case, permanently enjoining,
           restraining, preventing or prohibiting the Offer or the Merger and
           such injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling or other action
           shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, that the right
           to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be


                                       42
<PAGE>
           available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
           injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling was primarily due to
           the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under
           this Agreement (including Section 5.3);

                      (ii) if the Offer shall have expired pursuant to its terms
           (and not have been extended in accordance with Section 1.1 hereof)
           without any Shares being purchased therein, provided, that the right
           to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall not
           be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its
           obligations under this Agreement resulted in the failure of Purchaser
           to purchase Shares in the Offer; or

                      (iii) if no Shares shall have been purchased pursuant to
           the Offer on or before the Walk-Away Date; provided, that the right
           to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(iii) shall not
           be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its
           obligations under this Agreement resulted in the failure of the Offer
           to be so consummated by the Walk-Away Date.

           (c) By the Company:

                      (i) if Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer
           on or prior to the date provided therefor in Section 1.1;

                      (ii) if concurrently it enters into a definitive Company
           Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance
           with Section 5.2; provided, however, that the Company may only
           exercise this termination right prior to the Purchase Date; and,
           provided, further, that the Company makes payment of the Termination
           Fee in accordance with Section 7.3; or

                      (iii) if (A) the representations and warranties of Parent
           or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and
           correct on and as of the date of such determination as if made on
           such date (other than those representations and warranties that
           address matters only as of a particular date which are true and
           correct as of such date), except (x) for changes permitted by this
           Agreement or (y) where all such failures to be true and correct
           (without giving effect to any limitation as to "Material Adverse
           Effect" set forth therein) in the aggregate would not have a Parent
           Material Adverse Effect, or (B) Parent or Purchaser shall have
           breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply with
           any obligation, agreement or covenant required by this Agreement to
           be performed or complied with by them, which inaccuracy, breach or
           failure (in each case under clauses (A) and (B)) has not been cured
           within 20 business days after Parent receives from the Company
           written notice of such inaccuracy, breach or failure; provided,
           however, that the Company may only exercise this termination right
           prior to the Purchase Date.

           (d) By Parent:

                      (i) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any
           committee thereof (i) shall have withdrawn or modified or publicly
           proposes to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its
           approval or recommendation of this Agreement or any of the
           Transactions, (ii) fails to recommend to the stockholders of the
           Company that they accept the Offer and tender their Shares to
           Purchaser pursuant thereto, or (iii) shall have recommended to the
           stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal, or publicly proposes
           to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover
           Proposal; provided, however, that Parent may only exercise this
           termination right prior to the Purchase Date;

                      (ii) if the Company enters into a Company Acquisition
           Agreement; or

                      (iii) if (A) the representations and warranties of the
           Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct on
           and as of the date of such determination as if made on such date
           (other than those representations and warranties that address matters
           only as of a particular date which are true and correct as of such
           date), except (x) for changes permitted by this Agreement or (y)
           where all such failures to be true and correct (without giving effect
           to any limitation as to "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein)
           would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (B) the Company
           shall have breached or failed in any material respect to perform or
           comply with any obligation, agreement or covenant required by this
           Agreement to be performed or complied with by it, which inaccuracy,
           breach or failure (in each case under clauses (A) and (B)) has not
           been cured within 20 business days after the Company receives from
           Parent written notice of such inaccuracy, breach or failure;
           provided, however, that Parent may only exercise this termination
           right prior to the Purchase Date.

           7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (subject to its
terms), Sections 7.2 and 7.3, Article VIII, the last sentence of Section 1.2(b)
and the last sentence of Section 5.5, all of which shall survive termination of
this Agreement at any time, and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent or the Company or their respective directors, officers and affiliates,
except (i) the Company may have liability as provided in Section 7.3, and (ii)
nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or any willful breach
of this Agreement. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 prior to the expiration of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser will
promptly terminate the Offer upon such termination of this Agreement without the
purchase of Shares thereunder.

           7.3 Termination Fee.

           (a) Except as provided in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be borne solely and entirely by the party that incurred such fees and
expenses, irrespective of whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

           (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

           (i)        by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii);

           (ii)       by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i); or

           (iii)      by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii),

           the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
           available funds to an account designated by Parent reasonably in
           advance of such transmission, a non-refundable termination fee equal
           to $4,000,000 in cash (the "TERMINATION FEE") on the date of any such
           termination. Parent's acceptance of any sum pursuant to this Section
           7.3(b) shall constitute conclusive evidence that this Agreement has
           been validly terminated. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
           contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an integral part of the
           transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Parent and
           Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement without such
           agreements. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
           amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to obtain
           such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a final,
           non-appealable judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction
           against the Company for such amounts, the Company shall pay to Parent
           any costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
           incurred in connection with such suit.


                          ARTICLE VIII - MISCELLANEOUS

           8.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties; etc. The
representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at
the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, upon the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be,
except that the agreements set forth in Article II and Sections 5.7 and 5.8 and
any other agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance after the
Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely and those set forth
in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 and this Article VIII shall survive termination
indefinitely. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the
Effective Time.

           8.2 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby by
stockholders of the Company, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by


                                       45
<PAGE>
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors (which in the case of the
Company after the Purchase Date shall include the Independent Director Approval
contemplated by Section 1.3); provided, however, that following approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby by stockholders of the Company there shall be
no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
stockholder approval without such approval.

           8.3 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any
other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any
of such party's conditions; provided, however, in the case of the Company
following the Purchase Date, the Independent Director Approval contemplated by
Section 1.3 is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by
the Company, Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

           8.4 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties except that Parent or Purchaser may assign
any of their rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any of their
affiliates or to any financial institution providing financing to pay all or a
portion of the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that any such assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Purchaser from their respective obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section 8.4 shall be null and void.

           8.5 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received counterparts hereof signed by the other parties hereto.

           8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
This Agreement, except for the provisions of Article II and Sections 5.7 and
5.8, is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights hereunder.

           (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

           (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court, without bond or
other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

           (c) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court other than a Federal or State court sitting in the State of Delaware.

           (d) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all
rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                                                       -------

                             Conditions to the Offer
                             -----------------------

           The capitalized terms used in this Annex A have the meanings set
forth in the attached Agreement, except that the term the "AGREEMENT" shall be
deemed to refer to the attached Agreement.

           Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating
to Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance
for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment
for, any tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions of the Agreement) may
terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered shares if (i) the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at the expiration of the Offer,
or (ii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, any of the following
conditions shall exist:

           (a) there shall be any injunction, judgment, ruling, order or decree
instituted, issued or entered, or any Law enacted, issued, promulgated, amended
or enforced, by any Governmental Entity, which restrains, enjoins, prohibits or
makes illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, except where the same
are consistent with Parent's obligations under Section 5.3 of the Agreement;

           (b) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in the Agreement shall not be true and correct at and as of the expiration of
the Offer as if made on such date (other than those representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date which are true and
correct as of such date), except (1) for changes permitted by the Agreement or
(2) where all such failures to be true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) in the aggregate
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (B) the Company shall have
breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply with any
obligation, agreement or covenant required by the Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the expiration of the Offer;

           (c) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;

           (d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have been any
Company Material Adverse Effect; or

           (e) a moratorium on lending by banks shall have been declared by any
New York or United States Governmental Entity.

           The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Purchaser and may be asserted by either of them regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such conditions or may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole


<PAGE>
or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or
Purchaser (except for any conditions which, pursuant to Section 1.1 of the
Agreement, may only be waived with the Company's consent). The failure by Parent
or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be
deemed a waiver of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any
particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to
any other facts or circumstances, and each right will be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

           If the Offer is terminated, all tendered Shares not theretofore
accepted for payment shall forthwith be returned to the tendering stockholders.
