Section 3.20    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 
----------------------------   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the
"Agreement"), dated as of March 27, 2000, by and among Lernout and Hauspie
Speech Products N.V., a Belgian corporation ("Buyer"), LandH; Holdings USA,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer
("Sub"), Dragon Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and the
principal stockholders of Company listed on the signature page hereof (the
"Principal Stockholders").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer and
Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and
its respective stockholders that Buyer and Company combine in order to
advance the long-term business interests of Buyer and Company;   WHEREAS,
the combination of Buyer and Company shall be effected by the terms of this
Agreement through a merger of Company into Sub, as a result of which the
stockholders of Company will become stockholders of Buyer (the "Merger");  
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and as a condition and inducement to Buyer\'s willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the Principal Stockholders have entered into a Voting
Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement in the form attached as
Exhibit A hereto (the  --------- "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which the
Principal Stockholders have granted to Sub an irrevocable proxy to vote all
of the shares of capital stock of Company that such stockholders own;
and    WHEREAS, each of the Principal Stockholders has agreed with Buyer
to transfer the shares of Buyer Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.1(c)
hereof) that such Principal Stockholder will receive pursuant to the Merger
to a newly- formed limited liability company (the "LLC") of which he, she or
it will be the sole member with an interest for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; and   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
below, the parties agree as follows:  ARTICLE I. THE MERGER   Section 1.1
Effective Time of the Merger. 
-------------------------------------------   Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger in such form as is required by the
relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") (the
"Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the
Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.3) and thereafter delivered to
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.2). The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Effective Time") or at such
later time as is established by Buyer and Company and set forth in
the Certificate of Merger.   Section 1.2 Closing. 
----------------------   The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on a date to be specified by Buyer and
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered at Closing), at the
offices of Brown, Rudnick, Freed and Gesmer, P.C., One Financial Center,
Boston, Massachusetts, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in
writing by Buyer and Company.   Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. 
------------------------------------   At the Effective Time (i) the
separate existence of Company shall cease and Company shall be merged with
and into Sub (Sub following the Merger is sometimes referred to below as the
"Surviving Corporation"), and (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Closing shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and (iii) the Bylaws of Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Closing shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 251 of
the DGCL.   Section 1.4 Directors and Officers. 
-------------------------------------   The individuals serving as directors
of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time, each to serve as a director until his
or her successor   is duly elected or appointed. The individuals serving as
officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time, each to hold office until his or her
successor is duly elected or appointed.   Section 1.5 Actions Prior to
Closing.  ---------------------------------------   Effective as of the
Closing Date, the holders of shares of Company\'s Preferred Stock, $.04 par
value per share ( "Company Preferred Stock"), shall have converted such
shares into shares of common stock, $.04 par value per share, of Company (the
"Company Common Stock") and all rights of such holders with respect thereto
shall cease upon such conversion. As a result of the foregoing action, at the
time of Closing, the issued and outstanding capital stock of Company shall
consist solely of shares of Company Common Stock or options exercisable for
shares of Company Common Stock.   Section 1.6 Stock Options. 
----------------------------   Subject to Section 6.14 hereof, at the
Effective Time, Buyer shall substitute substantially equivalent warrants (the
"Warrants") to purchase Buyer Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.1(c)) for
all vested and unvested options (the "Options") outstanding under Company\'s
employee stock option plans (the "Company Stock Plans") at the Effective Time
to the extent permitted by the terms thereof or agreed to by the holder
thereof. Subject to the foregoing, immediately after the Effective Time, each
such Option shall be deemed to constitute a Warrant to acquire such number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of the Option multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share). The exercise
price per share of each such Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price of
the Option at the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent). The terms of Warrants otherwise shall be
substantially in the form of Buyer\'s standard form of warrant agreement with
such changes thereto as are reasonably requested by Company. Without limiting
the foregoing, for the purposes of determining vesting of the Warrants and
otherwise, employees of Company will be treated as if they had been employed
by Buyer during the full term during which they were employed by Company.  
Section 1.7 Alternative Merger Structure. 
-------------------------------------------   While it is currently
contemplated that the Merger shall be effected through the merger of Company
with and into Sub, Buyer may, upon delivery of written notice to Company at
least ten (10) days prior to Closing, propose an alternative transaction
structure whereby Buyer or an alternative Subsidiary of Buyer or Company may
be the acquiror or the Surviving Corporation (the "Alternative Transaction").
Within five (5) days of the receipt of such notice, Company shall notify
Buyer whether Company consents to the Alternative Transaction, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Company fails to so timely notify
Buyer, Company shall be deemed to have consented to the Alternative
Transaction. For purposes of this Section 1.7, Company\'s consent to an
Alternative Transaction shall not be considered to be unreasonably
withheld if Company reasonably determines that the Alternative Transaction
would adversely affect the Merger consideration or the tax-free nature of the
Merger. If Company consents (or is deemed to have consented) to the
Alternative Transaction, the appropriate technical provisions of this
Agreement and the related agreements shall be deemed to be amended as
necessary in order to effect the Alternative Transaction. If Company timely
notifies Buyer that Company does not consent to the   Alternative
Transaction, all provisions of this Agreement and the related agreements
shall continue to apply.  ARTICLE II. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   Section
2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. 
------------------------------------------   As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of Company or capital stock of Sub:   (a) Capital
Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of the 
-------------------- capital stock of Sub shall remain issued and
outstanding.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All shares of Company
Common  ------------------------------ Stock that are owned by Company as
treasury stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1)
of Company shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
stock of Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.   (c) Merger Shares. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2
hereof,  ------------- each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b))
shall be converted into the right to receive .15979 (the "Exchange Ratio")
shares of the Common Stock, BEF 21.54 fractional value per share, of Buyer
("Buyer Common Stock") (subject to reduction to account for fractional shares
and further adjustment in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof) (collectively,
the "Merger Shares"). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Shares and any cash in lieu
of fractional Merger Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(d)
hereof, without interest.   (d) Adjustments to Merger Shares. The number of
Merger Shares to  ---------------------------- be paid or issued in the
Merger shall be equitably adjusted (i) as set out in Section 2.3 hereof and
(ii) to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split,
reclassification, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Buyer
Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.   (e) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
----------------- Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by Stockholders (as defined in Section 2.2(a)) who shall not have voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Shares. Such
Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to   receive Merger Shares, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b),
of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares.
Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Company and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   Section 2.2 Exchange of
Certificates.  ---------------------------------------   The procedures for
exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for Buyer Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   (a) Exchange Fund. As of the
Effective Time, Buyer shall  ------------- cause to be delivered to
ChaseMellon Shareholder Services L.L.C. ("Exchange Agent") on behalf of all
holders of Company Common Stock (the "Stockholders") who have not exercised
their dissenter\'s right under Section 262 of the DGCL, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 2.2, (i) certificates representing the shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 (less the Escrow Shares,
as defined in Section 2.4) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make the
payments required pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (such cash and shares of Buyer
Common Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions thereon as
described in Section 2.2(h), being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").   (b) Exchange Procedures. Each holder of record of a 
------------------- certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into
the right to receive Merger Shares shall deliver to the Exchange Agent at the
Closing, a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal") in the form
appended to the Exchange Agent Agreement attached as Exhibit B hereto,
together with such Stockholder\'s  --------- certificates and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Exchange Agent, together with
such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Buyer shall cause
Exchange Agent to promptly deliver to such holder certificates representing
that number of whole shares of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Buyer Common Stock which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (less
such Stockholder\'s share, if any, of the Escrow Shares) plus cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(h), and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Company, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Buyer Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of
Buyer Common Stock   plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(d) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(h).   (c) No Further Ownership Rights
in Company Common Stock. All shares 
--------------------------------------------------- of Buyer Common Stock
issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash distributions paid pursuant to subsection
(d) of this Section 2.2) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.   (d) No Fractional Shares. No
certificate or scrip representing  -------------------- fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common
Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder
but after reduction by such Stockholder\'s share of the Escrow Shares) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by $107.50.  
(e) No Liability. Promptly following the close of business on the 
------------ earlier of (i) the date which is thirty (30) days after the
completion of the audit of Buyer\'s financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and (ii) June 30, 2001, Buyer shall instruct Exchange Agent
to return all shares of Buyer Common Stock included in the Exchange Fund then
in its possession and not theretofore claimed by a holder of Company Common
Stock to the Belgium Caisse des depots et Consignations or any similar
institution. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate may surrender such
Certificate to Buyer and, subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat
and similar laws, receive in exchange therefore the Buyer Common Stock with
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and any dividends or other distributions
with respect to the Buyer Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(h), to be provided by Buyer and the Buyer Common Stock portion of
such consideration to be provided by the Belgium Caisse des depots et
Consignations or such other institution that holds such shares of Buyer
Common Stock, without interest.   (f) Withholding Rights. Each of Buyer and
the Surviving  ------------------ Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, as the case may be.    (g) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, 
----------------- stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, Buyer will cause the Exchange Agent to issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Buyer
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (h)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Buyer Common Stock. 
------------------------------------------------------------ No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
the Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Buyer
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.2(d), until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(b). Subject to the
effect of escheat, tax or other applicable laws and Section 2.2(e), following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) within five (5) business days after
such surrender, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional
share of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and theretofore payable with respect to
such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring
after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock.   Section 2.3 Optional Adjustment to Merger Consideration for
Indebtedness. 
------------------------------------------------------------   (a) At least
five (5) business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, Company will
deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Indebtedness Statement") of the
amount of the (i) Closing Indebtedness of Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date, and (ii) Company\'s cash or cash equivalents on hand as of
the Closing Date. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Closing Indebtedness"
shall mean (i) all obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries created,
issued or incurred for borrowed money, including, without limitation, all of
Company\'s indebtedness to Fleet Bank, N.A. ("Fleet"), inclusive of accrued
interest, if any, on any of such obligations, (ii) all payment obligations of
Company under capital leases that are outstanding as of the Closing Date, and
(iii) all transaction costs (including without limitation all of Company\'s

cooperate fully with Buyer and will afford full access to the books, records
and work papers of Company from the date of this Agreement to the Closing
Date to enable Buyer to review the information presented on the
Closing Indebtedness Statement. The Closing Indebtedness Statement shall be
based on pay-off letters received from the holders of the Closing
Indebtedness to the extent available.   (b) If, and only if, the Net Cash
Amount (as hereinafter defined) on the Closing Date is less than negative
$10,545,500 (i.e., the Net Cash Amount is  ---- negative $10,545,501 or a
more negative number), then the Exchange Ratio shall  ---- be adjusted in
accordance with the formula described in this Section 2.3(b).    If the
Buyer so elects pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted to equal:   (A) the Deemed Total Consideration (as defined
below) divided by $107.50 divided by   (B) 35,298,107.   The "Deemed
Total Consideration" shall equal the sum of (A) $613,879,747, (B) the amount
of any commitment or closing fees, if any, paid by the Company to Fleet Bank,

Company under capital leases that are outstanding as of the Closing Date, and
(z) all transaction costs (including without limitation all of Company\'s
legal and financial advisors\' fees) incurred by Company in connection with
the Merger that are outstanding as of the Closing Date. The Net Cash Amount
may be a negative number.   (c) (i) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may
dispute in good faith any amounts reflected or required to be reflected on
the Closing Indebtedness Statement; provided, however, that Buyer shall have
notified Company in writing  -------- ------- of each disputed item,
specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute, within two business days of Company\'s
delivery of the Closing Indebtedness Statement to Buyer. In the event of such
a dispute, Buyer and Company shall attempt to reconcile their differences. If
Buyer and Company are unable to resolve any such dispute within one (1)
business day of Buyer\'s written notification to Company of any such disputed
amounts, Company and Buyer shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to an independent accounting firm of international
reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and Company (such accounting firm
being referred to herein as the "Independent Accounting Firm"), and shall
postpone the Closing Date until resolution of such dispute in accordance with
this Section 2.3. Such Independent Accounting Firm shall, within five (5)
business days after such submission, determine and report to Buyer and
Company upon such remaining disputed items. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated equally between Buyer and
Company.   (ii) In acting under this Section 2.3, the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

Principal Stockholders shall transfer to his, her or its respective LLC the
Merger Shares received by him, her or it pursuant to the Merger and such
Merger Shares shall be held by each such LLC pursuant to a Limited Liability
Company Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto ("LLC

qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept applies, is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction (which jurisdictions

failure to be so qualified would be   reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the business, properties, financial condition, or results
of operations of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Company Material Adverse
Effect"), provided that "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall not include
any change in or effect on the business, properties, financial condition or
results of operations of Company, that results from (a) the announcement or
pendency of the Merger, (b) general economic conditions, or (c) business and
economic conditions generally affecting the speech recognition industry.
Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any

exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding and (ii) there are no other options, warrants,

financial statements as of, and for, the year ended December 31, 1999 (the
"1999 Financial Statements"). The audited balance sheet of Company as of

1999 Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes to such financial statements) and fairly present in all material

and records of Company and its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.5 No Undisclosed

disclosed in the 1999 Financial Statements, (ii) for liabilities or
obligations not required under U.S. GAAP to be reflected in such financial
statements (or in the notes thereto) and (iii) except for customary
or recurring liabilities incurred since December 31, 1999 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices, Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities, either accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due, which individually or in the
aggregate are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.    Section 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. 
------------------------------------   Except as disclosed in the 1999
Financial Statements, since December 31, 1999, Company and its Subsidiaries
have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practice and, since such date, there has not been (i)
any change in the financial condition, results of operations, business, or
properties of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that has had,
or is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any
damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries having a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (iii) any material change by Company in its
accounting methods or principles not required pursuant to U.S. GAAP; (iv) any
revaluation by Company of any of its assets having a Company Material Adverse
Effect; or (v) any other action or event that would have required the consent
of Buyer pursuant to Section 5.1 of this Agreement had such action or event
occurred after the date of this Agreement.   Section 3.7 Taxes.  -----  
(a) Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all Tax Returns (as
defined below) that they were required to file, and all such Tax Returns were
correct and complete except for any failure to file, error or omission that,
individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid, or
made adequate provisions in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the payment of,
all Taxes (as defined below) owed (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns).
Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. All Taxes that
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was required by law to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required,
have been paid to the proper Governmental Entity, except for any such Taxes
with respect to which the failure to withhold, collect or pay, individually
or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" means all taxes, and
all charges, fees, levies or other similar assessments or liabilities in the
nature of a tax, including without limitation income, gross receipts, ad
valorem, premium, value added, excise, real property, personal property,
sales, use, services, transfer, withholding, employment, payroll and
franchise taxes imposed by the United States of America or any state, local
or foreign government, or any agency thereof, or other political subdivision
of the United States or any such government, and any interest, fines,
penalties, assessments or additions to tax resulting from, attributable to or
incurred in connection with any tax or any contest or dispute thereof. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Returns" means all reports, returns,
declarations, statements or other information required to be supplied to a
taxing authority in any jurisdiction in connection with Taxes.   (b) Company
has delivered to Buyer correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax
Returns, examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against
or agreed to by any of Company or any of its Subsidiaries since December 31,
1996. The federal income Tax Returns of Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Company has
delivered or made available to Buyer correct and complete copies of all other
material Tax Returns of Company and its Subsidiaries together with
all related examination reports and statements of deficiency for all periods
from and after December 31, 1996. No examination or audit of any Tax Return
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is currently
in progress or, to the knowledge of Company and Stockholders, threatened
or contemplated. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
informed by any jurisdiction   that the jurisdiction believes that Company
or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not
filed, except for any Tax Return with respect to which the failure to file,
individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to an
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, which
waiver or extension of time remains currently in effect.   (d) Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "consenting corporation" within the
meaning of Section 341(f) of the Code, and none of the assets of Company or
its Subsidiaries are subject to an election under Section 341(f) of the
Code.   (e) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   (f) Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made any payment, is obligated to make any payment, or is a
party to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to
make any payment that will be an "excess parachute payment" under Section
280G of the Code.   (g) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than Company
and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of federal, state, local, or foreign law), or as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.   (h) Neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever been a member of a group of
corporations with which it has filed (or been required to file) consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Returns, other than a group of which only Company and
its Subsidiaries are or were members.   (i) The unpaid Taxes of Company and
its Subsidiaries did not, as of December 31, 1999, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
Company Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto), and will not exceed
that reserve as adjusted for operations and transactions through the Closing
Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of Company and its
Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.  Section 3.8 Title to
Properties.  -------------------   (a) Section 3.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all real property leased by Company
or its Subsidiaries and the location of the premises. Company has provided
true and complete copies of all real property leases ("Leases") to Buyer.
Neither Company nor Subsidiary is in default, nor, to the knowledge of
Company, is any other party in default under any of the Leases, except where
the existence of such defaults, individually or in the aggregate, is not

reproduction or distribution of such Company Third Party Intellectual Rights
by or through Company), have been received by Company or to the knowledge of

Company or any Subsidiary infringes on any copyright, patent, trademark,
service mark or trade secret; (ii) against the use of any trademarks,
tradenames, trade secrets, copyrights, patents or computer software programs

Company and Subsidiaries, there has been and is no unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any of the
Company Intellectual Property Rights material to Company or any
Subsidiary.   (d) No Company Intellectual Property Right is subject to
any outstanding order, judgment, decree, or stipulation restricting in any

ordinary course of business and in accordance with Company\'s past practices,
neither Company nor any Subsidiary has entered into any agreement to
indemnify any other person against any charge of infringement of any Company
Third Party Intellectual Property Right.   (e) Company and the Subsidiaries
have taken reasonable measures to protect and preserve (i) the validity and
enforceability of trademarks included in the Company Intellectual Property

and other confidential information. All employees, contractors, agents and
consultants of Company and Subsidiaries have executed a nondisclosure and
assignment of inventions agreement substantially in the form as attached to

any such officer, employee, contractor, agent or consultant to be employed
or engaged by Company or any Subsidiary because of the nature of the

which Company has used, is presently using, or the use of which is reasonably
necessary to its business as now conducted or presently contemplated to be
conducted.   (g) Neither Company nor any Subsidiary has deposited, or is
obligated to deposit, any source code regarding its products into any source

combination involving Company or any Subsidiary (a "Third Party
Acquisition"). In the event Company consummates a Third Party Acquisition
before or any time after the termination of this Agreement based in whole or
in part upon, or as a result of, its breach of its obligations pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 6.1, Company shall pay to Buyer (on the first
business day after consummation of the Third Party Acquisition) Seventeen
Million Four Hundred Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($17,415,000) as a break-up fee
to compensate Buyer for the loss of the business opportunity, in immediately

remedy for any such breach.   Section 6.2 Tender for Shares; Placement
Memorandum/Proxy Statement; 
-------------------------------------------------------- Registration
Statement. ----------------------   (a) Buyer shall, between the date of
this Agreement and the date on which the Proxy Statement to be prepared by
Buyer and Company in connection with obtaining the approval of the Merger by
the Stockholders (the "Proxy Statement") is mailed to the Stockholders, make
an offer to purchase from certain of the Stockholders (which Stockholders
shall be identified jointly by Company and Buyer) their shares of Company
Common Stock, with a view towards reducing the number of holders of Company
Common Stock who are not "Accredited Investors" (as defined in Regulation D
("Regulation D") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the   "Securities Act")) to fewer than 35, in order enable Buyer to issue
the Merger Shares in a manner intended to comply with the private placement
exemption under Regulation D. Company shall use its best efforts to assist
Buyer in connection with Buyer\'s efforts to reduce the number of
nonaccredited investors to fewer than 35, including without limitation as set
forth on Schedule 6.2(a) hereto.  ---------------   (b) In the event Buyer
determines that it is able to purchase shares from a sufficient number of the
Stockholders to consummate the Merger under such private placement exemption,
then as promptly as practicable after Buyer makes such determination, Buyer
and Company shall jointly prepare proxy materials (in accordance with the
disclosure requirements of Regulation D) for the purpose of soliciting
proxies from the Stockholders to vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger at a meeting of the Stockholders to
be called and held for such purpose (the "Special Stockholders\' Meeting\'").
Such proxy materials shall be in the form of a placement memorandum/proxy
statement to be used for the purpose of offering the Merger Shares to the
Stockholders and soliciting such proxies from the Stockholders (such
placement memorandum/proxy statement, together with any accompanying letter
to Stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy, shall be referred to
herein as the "Placement Memorandum/Proxy Statement"). Each party
shall furnish all information reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation of the Placement Memorandum/Proxy Statement.   (c) If, on or
before May 1, 2000, Buyer is unable to purchase shares from a sufficient
number of the Stockholders to consummate the Merger under such private
placement exemption, as provided above, then as promptly as practicable after
Buyer makes such determination, Buyer and Company shall prepare and Buyer
shall file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form F-4 (or any
successor registration statement involving a similar amount of disclosure, or
if not then ineligible to use any such form, then any other available form of
registration statement) in which the Proxy Statement for the Special
Stockholders Meeting will be included as a prospectus. Buyer and
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective as soon after such filing as practicable. Each of Buyer
and Company will respond to any comments of the SEC and will use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filings and Company
will cause the Proxy Statement and the prospectus contained within the
Registration Statement to be mailed to the Stockholders at the earliest
practicable time after both the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC and the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each
of Buyer and Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement
or any filing pursuant to Section 6.2(d) hereof or for additional information
and will supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such
party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its
staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to
the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, the Merger or any filing
pursuant to Section 6.2(d) hereof. Each of Buyer and Company will cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or
any filing pursuant to Section 6.2(d) hereof, Buyer and Company, as the case
may be, will promptly   inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate
in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or
mailing to the Stockholders, such amendment or supplement. In the event that,
as a result of this Section 6.2(c), Buyer is required to file the
Registration Statement on Form F-4 (or any successor registration statement
involving a similar amount of disclosure, or if not then ineligible to use
any such form, then any other available form of registration statement), the
Outside Date (as defined in Section 9.1(b) below) shall automatically be
extended for a period of ninety (90) days from the date (which shall not be
later than May 1, 2000) on which Buyer reasonably determines that it will be
unable to consummate the Merger as a private placement under Regulation
D.   (d) Buyer and Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), applicable state blue sky laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder.   Section 6.3 Stockholder Documents.

or (ii) written agreement from such Stockholder regarding the representation

(b) any material failure of Buyer and Sub or Company, as the case may be, or
