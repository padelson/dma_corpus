 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 
_

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of January 29, 2012, is by and among Auto Acquisition Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), Auto Mergersub, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and The Pep Boys  Manny, Moe and Jack, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"). 

  

    
W I T N E S S E T H: 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of the common stock of the Company, par value $1.00 per share (the "Company Capital Stock"), to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, providing for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company as the Surviving Corporation, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the "PBCL"), and has adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company the Guarantee (the "Guarantee"), of each of the Investors, dated as of the date hereof, and pursuant to which each of the Investors has guaranteed the due and punctual payment, if and when such payment may be due and owing, of such Investor\'s portion of the Parent Termination Fee. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1 _ The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_. Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") under the name "The Pep Boys  Manny, Moe and Jack" and shall continue its existence under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. 

   

 Section 1.2 _ Effective Time; Closing._ No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Department of      

State"), in such form as required by and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the PBCL (the date and time of the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Department of State (or such later time as is
specified in the Articles of Merger) being the "Effective Time"). On the date
of such filing (the "Closing Date"), a closing (the "Closing") shall be held
at 9:00 a.m., Philadelphia time, at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius
LLP, 1701 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA (or such other time, date, or place
as the parties may agree).

  

 Section 1.3 _ Effect of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of Section 1929 of the PBCL. 

  

 Section 1.4 _ Conversion of Company Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_, each issued and outstanding share of Company Capital Stock at the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub) shall be converted into the right to receive $15.00 in cash without interest (the "Merger Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Capital Stock (i) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) that is owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) All shares of the Company Capital Stock cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and each certificate representing any shares of Company Capital Stock ("Certificate") and each uncertificated share of Company Capital Stock ("Uncertificated Share") which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall from and after the Effective Time represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_. 

  

 Section 1.5 _ Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
ARTICLE II 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

 Section 2.1 _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a paying agent mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in a separate fund established for the benefit of the holders of shares of the Company Capital Stock for payment in accordance with this _Article II_, immediately available funds constituting an amount equal to the Merger Consideration (such aggregate amount as deposited with the Paying Agent, the "Payment Fund"). 

        

 Section 2.2 _ Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (or, in the case of The Depository Trust Company on behalf of "street" holders, deliver) to each holder of record of a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form as reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock, as the case may be, represented by such Certificate multiplied by (b) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, and such holder of Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of (1) the number of Uncertificated Shares held by such holder multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 2.3 _ No Further Ownership Rights._ All cash paid as Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock. 

  

 Section 2.4 _ No Liability._ If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one (1) year after the Effective Time, any such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three (3) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration payable to the holder of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange) authority, agency, court commission, or other governmental body (each, a "Governmental Entity")), any such Merger Consideration, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.5 _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented thereby, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.6 _ Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment 

        

under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation.

  

 Section 2.7 _ Stock Transfer Books._ At the close of business on the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration, with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

 Section 2.8 _ Equity Awards Under Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP._ 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise set forth in a written agreement entered into after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time between Parent or its Affiliates and any holder of a Company Stock Option, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall become fully vested and exercisable, and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such Company Stock Option as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time) for each such Company Stock Option cancelled an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the aggregate excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Except as otherwise set forth in a written agreement entered into after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time between Parent or its Affiliates and any holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit, at the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award representing the right to receive shares of Company Capital Stock granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans that vests over the passage of time (each, a "Company Restricted Stock Unit") shall vest (to the extent not vested) and become free of such other lapsing restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such Company Restricted Stock Unit as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time) for each such Company Restricted Stock Unit canceled an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of units covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit that have not been settled or paid immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Except as otherwise set forth in a written agreement entered into after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time between Parent or its Affiliates and any holder of a Company Performance Stock Unit, at the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award representing the right to receive shares of Company Capital Stock granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans that vests based on the level of achievement of performance goals (each, a "Company Performance Stock Unit") shall vest at the target level (to the extent not vested) and become free of such other lapsing restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such Company Performance Stock Unit as soon as 

        

administratively practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time) for each such Company
Performance Stock Unit canceled an amount in cash determined by multiplying
(i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of units covered by such

 Section 5.7 _ Financing._ (a) Section 5.7(a) of Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true, accurate and complete copies of executed commitment letters issued to Parent by the Financing Sources party thereto (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing"). Section 5.7(a) of Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true, accurate and complete copies of executed commitment letters (collectively, the "Equity Commitment Letters" and together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "Financing Commitments") from each of the investors party thereto (collectively, the "Investors") pursuant to which the Investors have committed to invest the amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Equity Financing, including any syndication thereof, except as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters. The Equity Commitment Letters provide, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof. 

  

 (b) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. There are no other agreements, side letters, conditions precedent or arrangements relating to or affecting the Financing or the terms thereof, other than as set forth in the Financing Commitments and any related fee or engagement letter (true and correct redacted copies of which have been furnished to the Company).

Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (including any refinancing of indebtedness of Parent or the Company required in connection therewith). The Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. 

  

 Section 5.8 _ Operations of Parent and Merger Sub._ (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein. As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding.

outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 Section 5.11 _ Vote/Approval Required._ No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.12 _ No Other Representations or Warranties._ Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided to the Company. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Company, or the Company\'s or any other Person\'s use of, any such information, unless any such information is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in this _Article V_.

reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due
consideration to such comments.

  

 (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 Section 7.2 _ Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial

Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent (i) that an agreement
is required to be kept confidential in accordance with its terms, (ii) it is
required by a Governmental Entity or (iii) that, in the reasonable judgment of
the Company, applicable Law requires it or its Subsidiaries to restrict
access to any properties or information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the

restrictions and shall furnish information to the extent not so restricted;

efforts (without being required to make any payments) to obtain any approval,
consent or waiver with respect to such contract or agreement that is
necessary to provide such access. The parties will hold any such information

provisions of the letter agreement dated October 26, 2011, between The Gores
Group, LLC and the Company (as amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement").

On the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of all Persons from whom the Company received, after the date hereof and prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date (each, a "Go-Shop Party"), a written Competing Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determined (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is _bona fide_ and constitutes a Superior Proposal or a Competing Proposal that is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (b) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 7.3(c)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to: (i) on the Go-Shop Period End Date, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal or any proposal reasonably likely to result in a Competing Proposal (and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have all copies of all non-public information it or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives have distributed or made available since the date hereof to Persons in connection with their consideration of any Competing Proposal (other than with respect to Parent and its Affiliates), destroyed or returned to the Company as soon as possible); and (ii) from and after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated 

       

                                     

  

pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through any
Person, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or encourage any Competing
Proposal, (B) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any material non-public information in connection with any Competing
Proposal, (C) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with

commitment relating to any Competing Proposal or enter into any contract or
agreement in principle that is intended or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Competing Proposal.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_, if at any time after the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company receives a Competing Proposal which constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (i) furnish non-public information to the third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from such third party a signed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such third party with respect to the Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company taking such actions as described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , (A) such notice to Parent shall identify the Person making, and indicate in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of, such Competing Proposal, and (B) thereafter, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent redacted copies of any proposed definitive agreements received in connection with such Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right (i) to waive the provisions of any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to permit a Go-Shop Party to make a Competing Proposal on a non-public basis to the Company and its board of directors, (ii) to continue to engage in the activities described in _Section 7.3(a)_ following the Go-Shop Period End Date with any Go-Shop Party until 11:59 p.m. (EST) on March 29, 2012, and (iii) to engage in the activities described in _Section 7.3(c)_ with respect to any Person, including a Person that was previously a Go-Shop Party, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval if the Company receives a Competing Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal (A) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may not effect a Change of Recommendation relating to a Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of such Change of Recommendation or such termination (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal). Prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Competing Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

        

 (e) The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or "standstill" or similar agreement in favor of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may waive its rights under any confidentiality or "standstill" or similar agreement to the extent necessary to enable the parties subject thereto to make Competing Proposals to the Company. 

  

 (f) As used in this Agreement, 

  

  

 (i) the term "Competing Proposal" means any written _bona fide_ proposal made by a third party relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Capital Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Capital Stock or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its shareholders will own 15% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from any such transaction, other than transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 (ii) the term "Superior Proposal" means a Competing Proposal not solicited or initiated in material breach of this _Section 7.3_ that the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines (after consultation with outside legal counsel) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is (A) more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account all relevant factors as the Board of Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate, but which shall include all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing in response to such proposal after Parent\'s receipt of the notice contemplated by _Section 7.3(d)_) and (B) reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial (including having financing commitments, if any, and agreements to comply with requests of antitrust regulators, in each case, that are at least as certain as those provided by Parent), regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal); _provided_ that, for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "15% or more" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "all or substantially all". 

  

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position contemplated by 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Board of Directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided_ , that disclosures under this _Section 7.3(g)_ shall not be a basis, in themselves, for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_. 

  

 Section 7.4 _ Efforts; Cooperation._ 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof and to respond as promptly as practicable to any request 

        

for additional information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act
and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _(b)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including complying with any requests to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or complying with requests to conduct the business of the Company in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits.

 Section 7.5 _ Employee Benefit Matters._ 

  

 (a) During the one-year period commencing on the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who become employees of the Surviving Corporation ("Company Employees") annual salary and target bonus that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the annual salary and target bonus being provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From the Closing Date 

        

through and until January 29, 2013, Parent shall provide or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to Company Employees health and welfare
benefits programs (excluding any post-retirement health and welfare benefits)
that are, in the aggregate, not materially less favorable than the health and
welfare benefits programs being provided to Company Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans. If the 401(k)
Plan (as defined below) is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_
hereof, then no later than the date that is ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to offer a 401(k)
plan to Company Employees that is substantially similar, provided that the
employer match is at least as favorable, as the 401(k) Plan. If the 401(k)
Plan is not terminated in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_ hereof, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue the 401(k) Plan in
accordance with its terms. If the Puerto Rico Plan (as defined below) is
terminated in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_ hereof, then no later than the
date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the

substantially similar, provided that the employer match is at least as
favorable, as the Puerto Rico Plan. If the Puerto Rico Plan is not terminated
in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_ hereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue the Puerto Rico Plan in accordance with its terms.

  

 (b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee benefit plans of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service credit shall result in any duplication of benefits with respect to any service period. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New Plan ending on the date such Company Employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary and appropriate to fully vest all participants in the amounts credited to their accounts under each of the Company Deferred Compensation Plan and the Company Account Plan (collectively, the "Company Nonqualified Plans"), to the extent not vested as of the Closing Date. In addition, the Company shall terminate each of the Company Nonqualified Plans in accordance with the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) and Parent acknowledges and agrees to such termination of the Company Nonqualified Plans. In connection with the termination of the Company Nonqualified Plans, each participant entitled to receive a benefit under the Company Nonqualified Plans shall receive full payment of the total value of the amounts credited to their accounts under the Company Nonqualified Plans in a single lump sum cash payment as soon as administratively practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date). 

        

 (d) If requested by Parent prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, terminate The Pep Boys Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and no further contributions shall be made to the 401(k) Plan. If requested by Parent prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, terminate The Pep Boys Savings PlanPuerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico Plan") and no further contributions shall be made to the Puerto Rico Plan. If the 401(k) Plan is terminated, the Company shall provide to Parent any executed resolutions by the Company\'s Board of Directors authorizing such termination. If the Puerto Rico Plan is terminated, the Company shall provide to Parent any executed resolutions by the Company\'s Board of Directors authorizing such termination. 

  

 Section 7.6 _ Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ 

   

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of association, certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organization documents) or in any written indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, solely to the extent required by: (i) the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.6(a)_, during the period ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitee\'s capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B) the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 7.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of the applicable Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain a six-year pre-paid "tail policy" covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the current policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (the "Current DandO Policy") with 

        

such coverage levels not materially less favorable to such indemnified
persons than those of the Current DandO Policy; _provided_ , that (i)
such "tail" insurance policies shall not require the payment of an aggregate
annual premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to
maintain the Current DandO Insurance (and if the annual premium of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount) and (ii) prior to the Closing,
the Company shall not enter into any Contract for a "tail" policy without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the
Current DandO Policy with levels of coverage no less favorable than that
provided as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to purchase comparable policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance for such six (6)-year period with levels of coverage no
less favorable as provided under the Current DandO Policy as of the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the Current DandO Insurance (and
if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount).

  

 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_. The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her successors, heirs or representatives. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.10_ hereof to the contrary, this _Section 7.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_. 

  

 Section 7.7 _ Public Announcements._ Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or exchange listing requirements to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party. 

  

 Section 7.8 _ Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the Company, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm 

        

of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger. During the period from the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Closing, Parent shall not, and Parent shall cause its
Affiliates not to enter into any agreement to acquire, or make any premerger
notification filing under the HSR Act (or similar filing under any Antitrust
Law) or public announcement with respect to the acquisition of, any debt or
equity interests in, or any assets of, any of the entities listed in Section
7.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter or any of their direct or indirect
subsidiaries or franchises of such entities; provided, however, that neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be restricted under this _Section
7.8_ from (i) acquiring the goods and services sold by any such entity,
subsidiary or franchise, or (ii) acquiring debt or equity interests of any
such entity, subsidiary or franchise as a passive investment.

In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (B) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms that are not materially less favorable from the standpoint of Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first or second sentence of this _Section 7.9(a)_ being referred to as the "Financing Agreements"). Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions, in each case those that are within their control, of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitments, the Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material breach of the Financing Commitments, the Financing Agreements, any alternative financing commitments, and any related fee and engagement letter by Parent or Merger Sub shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section 7.9(a)_. Parent shall (x) furnish complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements to the Company as promptly as practicable after their execution, (y) give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitments, or the Financing Arrangements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, or any termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacement thereof). 

  

 (b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parent\'s sole expense, cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any related sale-leaseback transactions) as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries).

assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to such agreements as may
be reasonably requested, _provided_ that no obligation of the Company
under any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the
Effective Time and (ii) providing to the lenders specified in the Financing
Commitments (or any alternative financing commitments) financial and other
information in the Company\'s possession with respect to the Merger, making
the Company\'s senior officers available to assist the lenders specified in
the Financing Commitments (or any alternative financing commitments) and
otherwise reasonably cooperating in connection with the consummation of the
Financing, including (A) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
legal opinions, customary landlord, warehouse and bailee lien and access
waivers and deposit and investment account control agreements at the sole
expense of and as requested by Parent on behalf of the Financing Sources, (B)
executing and delivering authorization letters with respect to the
distribution of bank information memoranda, (C) authorizing any
existing lenders or agent for such lenders to disclose any information with

documents) which authorization shall be on terms and conditions reasonably
satisfactory to such existing lenders or agent, (D) providing unaudited
consolidated monthly financial statements of the Company (excluding
footnotes) consisting of a balance sheet, income statement and statement of
cash flows to the extent the Company customarily prepares such
financial statements, (E) participating in meetings (including customary one-
on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and senior
management and Representatives of the Company), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies
in connection with the Debt Financing, (F) participation by senior management
of the Company in the negotiation of the Financing Agreements relating to the
Debt Financing, (G) using its commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources to
facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of any and all conditions
precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements relating to the Debt Financing, and (H) delivering to Parent and
the Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable after Parent\'s request
therefor, all other information with respect to the business, operations,
financial condition, projections and prospects of the Company as is
customarily provided by a borrower in a secured financing transaction and is
available to the Company on a commercially reasonable basis. All non-public or
otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
obtained by Parent or representatives of Parent pursuant to this _Section
7.9_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub, and the arrangers under the
Financing Commitments, shall be permitted to disclose such information to
potential syndicate members during syndication, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by such potential syndicate members. Subject to
the terms and conditions of any applicable Contract, the Company hereby
consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries\' logos in connection
with the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos are used in a manner that
is not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any
replacements thereof) prior to the Effective Time.

  

 Section 7.10 _ Section 16(b)._ Parent and the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_, all Expenses incurred by the 

        

Company for clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be paid by the Company (and if
previously paid by Parent, shall be promptly reimbursed upon termination of
this Agreement). As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the party\'s independent
advisor, counsel and accountants, incurred by the party or on its behalf in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the preparation,
printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of
shareholder approvals related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ or _(d)_ and, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting,  a Competing Proposal has been publicly proposed or disclosed, and, in each case, not publicly withdrawn at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay Parent by wire transfer of same day funds a fee equal to the Termination Fee (as defined below); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Termination Fee will be payable by the Company pursuant to clause (A) above unless and until within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement relating to a Competing Proposal or consummates the transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal, in which case such Termination Fee shall be paid at the closing (and as a condition of closing) of the transactions contemplated by the Competing Proposal. "Termination Fee" means $25 million in cash, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (EST) on March 29, 2012 pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement with a Go-Shop Party with respect to a Superior Proposal, in which case the Termination Fee shall mean $10 million in cash. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent\'s right to receive the payment of the Termination Fee from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against the Company for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation in this Agreement (other than in connection with a material violation or material breach of _Section 7.3_ for which all applicable legal and equitable remedies shall be available to Parent and Merger Sub) by the Company, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members, stockholders, assignees, representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligations relating to or arising out of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or _Section 9.1(h)_, Parent shall promptly pay (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination) to the Company as liquidated damages and not as a penalty by wire transfer of same day funds a fee equal to $50 million in cash (the "Parent Termination Fee"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company\'s right to receive the payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, partners, managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates against Parent or Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation in this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or obligations relating to or arising out of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Sections 9.4(b)_ and _(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid 

        

amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published
in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such
amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.
