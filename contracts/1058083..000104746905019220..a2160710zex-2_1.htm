AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 10, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), among (i) VNU N.V., a limited liability company with corporate seat in Haarlem, the Netherlands (" _Parent_ "), (ii) Isaac Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (" _Merger Sub_ "), (iii) IMS Health Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), (iv) solely for purposes of Article II, Isaac Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Holdings_ "), and (v) solely for purposes of Sections 6.1(b), 6.16(a) and 6.16(b), the foundation under Dutch Law _Stichting tot Beheer van de Prioriteitsaandelen in VNU NV_ , holder of all issued and outstanding Priority Shares of Parent (the " _Priority Foundation_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and conditions contained herein, and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; and 

  

 WHEREAS, each of the Supervisory and Executive Boards of Parent and the Board of Directors of the Priority Foundation has resolved to enter into, and the Board of Directors of each of Holdings and Merger Sub has approved and declared it advisable to enter into, this Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and conditions contained herein; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

  

 SECTION 1.1 _ The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.2 _ Closing; Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other place or at such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties hereto, being the " _Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.      
  

 SECTION 1.4 _ Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the restated certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit 1.4(a) hereto and as so amended shall be the restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, the amended and restated by-laws of the Company shall be amended and restated so as to read in their entirety as set forth on Exhibit 1.4(b) hereto and as so amended shall be the amended and restated by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law. 

  

  

 SECTION 1.5 _ Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ The Company shall cause the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to submit their resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time. The Company shall cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all necessary action to cause the election or appointment of the officers of the Company (other than those who Parent determines shall not remain as officers of the Surviving Corporation) immediately prior to the Effective Time as officers of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be effective as of the Effective Time. Such officers shall hold office with the Surviving Corporation, in each case until the earlier of his or her resignation or removal. 

  

    
ARTICLE II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS 

   

 SECTION 2.1 _ Conversion of Securities._ At the Effective Time, in accordance with this Article II, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ," which defined term shall include, for all purposes of this Agreement other than this Section 2.1, the associated Preferred Stock purchase rights to the extent such rights are still outstanding), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a)) (all such shares of Common Stock, the " _Shares_ ") shall be canceled and each holder of Shares shall be entitled to receive from Holdings or Parent, as contemplated below, in the aggregate, in compensation for the cancellation of each Share and in exchange therefor, (i) $11.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), plus (ii) 0.60415 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") American Depository Shares of Parent (" _Parent Depository Shares_ ", each Parent Depository Share representing one common share, par value €0.20 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Shares_ ")), which Parent Depository Shares shall, for purposes of the Laws of the Netherlands, be paid for by the holder of the Share through the contribution described below (such Parent Depository Shares, and any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional Parent Depository Shares pursuant to Section 2.5(j), the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). By virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders of Shares, each holder of Shares shall be deemed to have subscribed under this Agreement for the Parent Common Shares underlying the Parent Depository Shares that are to be issued to such holder in accordance with this Article II. In accordance with the Law of the Netherlands, each holder of Shares shall be obligated to pay up the Parent Common Shares underlying the Parent 

  

      

  

Depository Shares so issued to such holder in accordance with this Article
II. This payment obligation on the part of the holders of Shares (which,
solely for the purpose of satisfying this obligation to pay up the Parent
Common Shares underlying the Parent Depository Shares, shall be equal to the
par value of such Parent Common Shares) shall be fully satisfied and paid by
contribution by transfer to Parent of such holder\'s right to receive
compensation (which, solely for the purpose of satisfying this obligation to
compensate the holders of Shares, shall also be equal to the par value of
such Parent Common Shares) from Holdings for the cancellation of the Shares.
It is understood that, if the Merger is consummated, the stockholders of the
Company are entitled to receive the Parent Depository Shares representing
Parent Common Shares directly from Parent or Holdings and that, if the Merger
is consummated, such stockholders will thereupon become third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement solely for this purpose. For the avoidance of
doubt, (x) in no event shall the amount of the Merger Consideration to be
received by each holder of Shares pursuant to this Article II be reduced by
the obligation to pay up the Parent Common Shares underlying the Parent
Depository Shares or the contribution to Parent of such holder\'s right to
receive compensation and (y) Holdings shall be obligated to deliver the
Merger Consideration to holders of Shares in accordance with, and subject to
the terms of, this Article II; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations
of Holdings to deliver the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration
under this Article II may be assigned, in whole or in part, to Parent or any
of Parent\'s wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries ( _provided_ that
no such assignment shall relieve Holdings of its obligations hereunder).
Parent shall fully and unconditionally cause Holdings (or its successor or
assign) to comply with such obligation and Parent hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees ( _hoofdelijke aansprakelijkheid_ ) to the holders of
Shares the due and punctual performance and payment by Holdings (and its
successors and assigns) of its obligations under this Section 2.1. Parent
hereby waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice
of default or nonpayment to or upon Holdings and whenever a default occurs for
any reason whatsoever in the performance by Holdings (or its successors or
assigns) of any of its obligations under this Article II, Parent shall
forthwith unconditionally perform and satisfy (or procure performance and
satisfaction of) such obligations. The liability of Parent under this Section
2.1 shall not be released or diminished by any variation of the obligations of
Holdings set forth in this Article II or any forbearance, neglect or delay in
seeking performance of such obligations or any granting of time for such
performance, in each case regardless of whether any notice of the same has
been delivered to Parent.

  

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) At any time prior to August 31, 2005, if the Board of Directors of the Company, in its good faith and reasonable judgment, requests that Parent agree to amend Section 2.1 of this Agreement to read substantially as set forth in Section 2.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent agrees promptly to enter into such amendment and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to effect conforming amendments to reflect the amendment set forth in Section 2.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. For avoidance of doubt, any such request shall be conclusively deemed reasonable if the Tax costs that would be incurred by holders of Shares or Company Stock Options as a result of the Merger assuming Section 2.1 of this Agreement remains unchanged ( _provided_ that such Tax costs shall be net of any indemnity or other compensation that Parent is willing to provide to the holders of Shares or Company Stock Options) would be higher than the Tax costs 

  

      

  
  

that would be incurred by such holders as a result of the Merger assuming
Section 2.1 of this Agreement were amended to read as set forth in Section
2.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

 SECTION 2.2 _ Certain Actions Related to Conversion of Securities_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Parent Depository Shares._ The Parent Depository Shares issued in connection with the Merger shall be evidenced by one or more receipts (" _Parent ADRs_ ") issued in accordance with a Deposit Agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, to be entered into by Parent, The Bank of New York or another institution selected by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company, as Depository (the " _Depository_ "), and the owners and holders from time to time of Parent ADRs, as amended (the " _Deposit Agreement_ "). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall pay for any Dutch capital taxes imposed in connection with the issuance or creation of the Parent Depository Shares to be issued in connection with the Merger and any Parent ADRs in connection therewith. 

  

 (b) _ Adjustment of Merger Consideration._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares or Parent Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split or combination ( _splitsing van aandelen, samenvoeging van (verschillende klassen van) aandelen),_ recapitalization ( _omzetting reserves in aandelenkapitaal),_ stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination, adjustment of par value, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, or Parent changes the number of Parent Common Shares represented by a Parent Depository Share, the Cash Consideration, the Exchange Ratio, the Stock Consideration and any other dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Cash Consideration, Exchange Ratio or Stock Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence. 

  

 (c) _ No Further Rights._ From and after the Effective Time, the shares of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and, subject to Section 2.4(a), no holder of shares of Common Stock shall have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares pursuant to this Article II and the right to receive dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(h), in each case without interest and only upon compliance with the applicable provisions of this Article II. 

  

  

 SECTION 2.3 _ Options; Restricted Stock_. 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (each a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if unvested, shall become fully vested and exercisable and, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to acquire a number of Parent Depository Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time times (ii) the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient of the Cash Consideration divided by the Average Closing Price (such sum, the " _Adjusted Conversion Number_ "), at a price per Parent Depository Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option divided by the Adjusted Conversion Number; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of Parent Depository Shares purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of Parent Depository Shares purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the 

  

      

  

requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided
in this Section 2.3(a), following the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall take all actions necessary for the assumption of such
Company Stock Options and, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of such Company Stock Options appropriate
notices that such Company Stock Options have been assumed by Parent and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.3(a)).

  

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) " _Average Closing Price_ " means the average of the per share closing prices of Parent Common Shares as reported on Eurolist by Euronext Amsterdam for the ten (10) trading days ending on the second-to-last trading day prior to the Closing Date; (ii) " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the plans set forth in Section 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (iii) any conversion of euros into U.S. dollars, or vice versa, that is required to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.3 shall be done at the daily 10 a.m. dollar to Euro spot rate for each trading day as quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its Internet site (http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/fxrates/tenAm.cfm) or as otherwise published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date on which such a calculation is required to be made. 

  

 (c) Each issued and outstanding Share subject to vesting or other lapse or forfeiture restrictions pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (each a " _Restricted Share_ "), and each award of restricted stock units held by a current or former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, an " _RSU Award_ "), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions to the extent required by the terms and conditions thereof (and if not required by such terms and conditions, shall vest and become free of such restrictions on the Closing Date) and shall be treated in the same manner as all other Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.1(a). 

   

 (d) Parent shall have available after the Effective Time the number of Parent Depository Shares required to satisfy upon exercise or settlement, as applicable, all Company Stock Options or RSU Awards outstanding immediately following the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.3(a). Parent shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC"_ ) a registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act prior to the Effective Time so that Parent shall have available from and after the Effective Time the number of Parent Depository Shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement, as applicable, of Company Stock Options or RSU Awards as provided in Section 2.3(a), and shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to become effective and comply, to the extent applicable, with state securities or "blue sky" laws with respect thereto, at the Effective Time, and (ii) maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as those options remain outstanding. In addition, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to do all such things as are required under applicable Laws for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon exercise or settlement, as applicable, of Company Stock Options or RSU Awards to be admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam and for the corresponding Parent Depository Shares to be admitted for listing and trading on the NYSE. 

  

 (e) The Company shall take all such action as is necessary prior to the Effective Time to give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3. 

  

  

 SECTION 2.4 _ Dissenting Shares_. 

  

  

 (a) Shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the 

  

      

  

Merger and who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid
the fair value of such shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and the
holder thereof shall not receive the Merger Consideration as compensation for
such cancellation, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall
effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholder\'s rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, such stockholder\'s Shares in respect of which the
stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, at the
Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration (payable without any interest thereon) as compensation for
such cancellation.

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights. 

  

  

 SECTION 2.5 _ Surrender of Shares_. 

  

  

 (a) Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Shares (" _Certificates_ "), or Shares represented, immediately prior to the Effective Time, by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case for the Merger Consideration (including cash payable in lieu of fractional interests in Parent Depository Shares in accordance with Section 2.5(j)). 

  

 (b) Parent or Holdings shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, from time to time, (i) that number of Parent ADRs in any denominations as the Exchange Agent shall specify and (ii) cash, in each case as are issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this Article II in respect of Shares for which Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall reflect the payment structure set forth in Section 2.1(a) hereof and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder representing such Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of Shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. The forms of such letter of transmittal and instructions for use shall be prepared by Parent and shall be approved by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Each stockholder, upon surrender by such holder to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, (A) the number of whole Parent Depository Shares (evidenced by Parent ADRs) which such holder has the 

  

      

  
  

right to receive pursuant to the terms hereof after properly surrendering
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and (B) a check in an amount
of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to
Section 2.5(k)) equal to (x) the amount of cash (including the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional interests in Parent Depository
Shares (to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5(j)) which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the terms hereof after properly surrendering
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, plus (y) any cash dividends
or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.5(h).

  

 (e) No interest shall be paid or accrue for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares. If payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or issuance shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until so surrendered, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. 

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II. 

  

 (g) Any Parent Depository Shares to be issued and any cash to be paid in respect of Shares (including any cash in lieu of fractional interests in Parent Depository Shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5(j), plus any cash dividend or other distribution that a former holder of Shares has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(h)) pursuant to this Article II, that remains unclaimed by any former holder of Shares nine months after the Effective Time shall be held by the Exchange Agent (or a successor agent appointed by Parent) or shall be delivered to Parent (or to the Depository upon the instruction of Parent and held by the Depository subject to the instruction of Parent in an account or accounts designated for this purpose). Neither Parent nor Holdings (including any successor or assign thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any securities properly delivered or any amount properly paid by the Depository, the Exchange Agent or its nominee, as the case may be, to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Depository Shares issuable pursuant to this Article II shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II. Upon surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of whole Parent Depository Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those whole Parent Depository Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those whole Parent Depository Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 

  

      

   

  

 (i) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by the Certificate pursuant to this Article II. 

  

 (j) No fractional interests in Parent Depository Shares shall be issued pursuant to the Merger. Each holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional interest in a Parent Depository Share pursuant to the terms of this Article II shall be entitled to receive, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(j), a cash payment (without interest) in lieu of that fractional interest in a Parent Depository Share determined by multiplying (i) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price for a Parent Depository Share as reported on the NYSE on the first trading day following the date on which the Effective Time occurs. Any cash payment in lieu of a fractional interest shall be made in U.S. dollars. 

  

 (k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Holdings (including any successor or assign thereof) and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of this payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority, Parent, Holdings (including any successor or assign thereof) or the Exchange Agent shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Shares, sold this consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of the consideration at the time of the deemed sale and paid these cash proceeds to the appropriate Taxing authority. 

  

 (l) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent by Parent or Holdings (or caused to be deposited by Parent or Holdings), as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Cash Consideration payable to holders of Shares entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests, as provided in Section 2.5(j), and Parent or Holdings shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Shares entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

The Company and Parent agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

  

 SECTION 6.4 _ Company Acquisition Proposals_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company may (A) provide access to its properties, books and records in response to a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) engage in any negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking any 

  

      

  

of the actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B), (w) the Company receives from
the party so requesting such access or information or making such proposal an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes
specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that the Company
may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or
with a standstill provision that is less favorable to the Company than the
standstill provision contained in the Confidentiality Agreement if it waives
or similarly modifies the standstill provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement), (x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal from the party
that made the applicable Company Acquisition Proposal, (y) the Company has
complied with its obligations under this Section 6.4, and (z) the Company
shall inform Parent prior to the taking by it of any such action. A " _Company
Superior Proposal_ " means a Company Acquisition Proposal (with the
references to "20% or greater" and "20% or more" contained therein being
replaced with "greater than 50%") that is reasonably capable of being
consummated, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing, and
similar aspects of, and conditions to, the proposal, the likelihood of
obtaining necessary financing and the person making the proposal, and that,
if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Company
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take the necessary steps promptly to inform the Company Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.4.

  

 (b) The Company agrees that neither the Company, any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective Boards of Directors or any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation or (ii) approve of or recommend (each a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ ") or approve or enter into any letter of intent, agreement, memorandum of understanding or Contract with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or exempt any person other than Parent and Merger Sub from the restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company receives an unsolicited Company Superior Proposal, the Company\'s Board of Directors may effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into an agreement for a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such a Change in Company Recommendation or termination of this Agreement unless (i) the Board of Directors shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in response to a Company Superior Proposal, which notice shall attach the most current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Company Superior Proposal and all other material information relating to such Company Superior Proposal in reasonable detail, and (ii) Parent does not make, within three business days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Company Superior Proposal. The Company shall be required to comply with the foregoing, including such three business day notice period, each time it proposes to effect a Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company Superior Proposal, including in respect of any change in price or any material other amendments or modifications of an existing Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that, during the three business day period prior to its effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation or 

  

      

  
  

termination of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and the Parent Representatives
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent.

   

 (c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company also shall, if it has not already done so, promptly request that each person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished to any person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) Promptly (and in any event within one business day) after receipt by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives of any Company Acquisition Proposal, or if any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors, officers or the Company Representatives with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal and the identity of any party making a Company Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or seeking such discussions or negotiations, and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including any material modifications or developments with respect thereto). The Company shall contemporaneously make available to Parent (to the extent it has not previously done so) all nonpublic information made available to any person making a Company Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (e) Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, (i) nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall limit in any way the obligation of the Company to convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.1 of this Agreement and (ii) the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the commencement of any tender offer or exchange offer with respect to the Common Stock, nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that, unless permitted by and in compliance with this Section 6.4, neither the Company nor its Board of Directors may recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal or effect a Company Change in Recommendation; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Company or its Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer containing the substance of a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to such Rule 14d-9(f)) shall not be considered a Company Change in Recommendation. 

  

  

 SECTION 6.5 _ Parent Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

  

 (a) Parent agrees that none of it or its subsidiaries and none of their respective officers, directors, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents, advisors or representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") shall, (i) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any inquiries, or the making, submission or reaffirmation of any proposal or offer, with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving Parent or any of its significant subsidiaries or any acquisition in any manner of an equity interest 

  

      

  

representing a 20% or greater economic or voting interest in Parent or any of
its significant subsidiaries, or with respect to the assets, securities or
ownership interests of or in Parent or any of its subsidiaries representing
20% or more of the consolidated assets of Parent and its subsidiaries, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as a " _Parent Acquisition
Proposal_ "), or (ii) directly or indirectly, engage in, approve or enter into
any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its
properties, books and records or any confidential information or data to any
person relating to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote, Parent
may (A) provide access to its properties, books and records in response to a
request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Parent Acquisition Proposal or (B) engage in any negotiations or discussions
with any person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Parent
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to taking any of
the actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B), (w) Parent receives from the
party so requesting such access or information or making such proposal an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes
specifically necessary in order for Parent to be able to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that Parent may
enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with
a standstill provision that is less favorable to Parent than the standstill
provision contained in the Confidentiality Agreement if it waives or similarly
modifies the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement), (x) the
Supervisory and Executive Boards of Parent shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with Parent\'s outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal, (y) Parent has
complied with its obligations under this Section 6.5, and (z) Parent shall
inform the Company prior to the taking by it of any such action. A " _Parent
Superior Proposal_ " means a Parent Acquisition Proposal (with the references
to "20% or greater" and "20% or more" contained therein being replaced with
"greater than 50%") that is reasonably capable of being consummated, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing, and similar aspects of,
and conditions to, the proposal, the likelihood of obtaining necessary
financing and the person making the proposal, and that, if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to Parent, Parent\'s business and
Parent\'s stakeholders than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement proposed by the Company in response to such Parent Acquisition
Proposal). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take the necessary
steps promptly to inform the Parent Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.5.

  

 (b) Parent agrees that neither Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, Parent\'s Supervisory or Executive Boards or any committee thereof shall (i) unless required to do so by applicable Law, withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the Company the Parent Board Recommendation contained in the Parent Circular or (ii) approve of or recommend (each a " _Change in Parent Recommendation_ ") or approve or enter into any letter of intent, agreement, memorandum of understanding or Contract with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote, Parent receives an unsolicited Parent Superior Proposal, Parent\'s Supervisory and Executive Boards may effect a Change in Parent Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into an agreement for a Parent Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Supervisory and Executive Boards of Parent may not effect such a Change in Parent Recommendation or termination of this Agreement unless (i) the Supervisory and Executive Board shall have first provided prior written notice to the Company that they are prepared to effect a Change in Parent Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in response to a Parent Superior Proposal, which notice shall attach the most current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Parent Superior 

  

      

  
  

Proposal and all other material information relating to such Parent Superior
Proposal in reasonable detail, and (ii) the Company does not make, within
three business days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that the
Supervisory and Executive Boards determine in good faith, after consultation
with Parent\'s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is at least as
favorable to Parent, Parent\'s business and Parent\'s stakeholders as such
Parent Superior Proposal. Parent shall be required to comply with the
foregoing, including such three business day notice period, each time it
proposes to effect a Change in Parent Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement in response to a Parent Superior Proposal, including in respect of
any change in price or any material other amendments or modifications of an
existing Parent Superior Proposal. Parent agrees that, during the three
business day period prior to its terminating this Agreement, Parent and the
Parent Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the Company and the
Company Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by the Company.

  

 (c) Parent shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent also shall, if it has not already done so, promptly request that each person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Parent Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished to any person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) Promptly (and in any event within one business day) after receipt by Parent, its subsidiaries or any of the Parent Representatives of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or if any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, Parent, its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors, officers or the Parent Representatives with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, Parent shall provide the Company with written notice of the material terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or the identity of any party making any Parent Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or seeking such discussions or negotiations, and thereafter shall keep the Company informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including any material modifications or developments with respect thereto). Parent shall contemporaneously make available to the Company (to the extent it has not previously done so) all nonpublic information made available to any person making a Parent Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (e) Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, (i) nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall limit in any way the obligations of Parent to convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.1 of this Agreement and (ii) Parent shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any matter relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the commencement of any tender offer or exchange offer with respect to the Parent Common Shares, nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prevent Parent or its Supervisory or Executive Boards from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required to be disclosed by any applicable Law; _provided_ that, unless permitted by and in compliance with this Section 6.5, neither Parent nor its Supervisory or Executive Boards may recommend any Parent Acquisition Proposal or effect a Parent Change in Recommendation; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or any similar communication by Parent or its Supervisory or Executive Boards to the stockholders of Parent pursuant to applicable Law shall not be considered a Parent Change in Recommendation. 

  

      

  
 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _ Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. 

  

  

 (a) For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, maintain a severance pay practice, program or arrangement for the benefit of those individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Affected Employees_ ") that is no less favorable than such practice, program or arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Affected Employees. 

  

 (b) Parent agrees that, from the Effective Time through December 31, 2006, the Company Employees will continue to be provided with benefits under employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate (the " _Continued Benefits_ "), and salaries or hourly wage rates that are no less, than those provided by the Company and its subsidiaries to such employees at the Closing. Thereafter, Parent intends to provide common benefit plans and programs to its employees and those of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Continued Benefits provided to the Company Employees will be extended through June 30, 2007, if each of the members of Parent\'s Executive Board who were, immediately prior to the Effective Time, employees of the Company, deliver a written notice to Parent, by October 31, 2006, that such Continued Benefits shall be so extended. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, fulfill and discharge all legally binding employee benefit obligations to Company Employees under the Company Plans and all legally binding employee severance plans (or policies) in existence on the date hereof and all legally binding employment or severance agreements entered into by the Company or adopted by the board of directors of the Company prior to the date hereof, as amended consistent with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, give Affected Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and determining early retirement, severance, disability, post-retirement medical and vacation entitlement under the employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or in which such Affected Employees participate for such Affected Employees\' service with the Company or its subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the Company or such subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, with respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent for the benefit of Affected Employees on and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same extent waived under comparable plans of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such Affected Employees with respect to similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries. 

   

 (d) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the employees of Parent, the Company, or any of their affiliates, any rights or remedies, including, without limitation, any right to employment, or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of the Agreement. 

  

 (e) The Company and Parent agree to reasonably cooperate to avoid or mitigate the effects of Sections 280G of the Code (including but not limited to taxes and the loss of deductibility of payments) with respect to any amounts or benefits payable to the Company Employees 

  

  

 SECTION 6.7 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

  

 (a) From and following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer or director of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and 

  

      

  

expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements
(collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions taken by them in their capacity as
officers or directors prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement
and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under the DGCL. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of reasonable expenses incurred in the defense of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

  

 (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company and the current fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof or (ii) arrange for "tail" coverage for such six-year period under the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that during this period, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to maintain any coverage in excess of the amount that can be obtained for the remainder of the period for an annual premium of 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage, the amount of which is set forth in Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.7 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section. 

  

 (e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 STOCKHOLDERS

  

 2.1. _ Annual Meeting._ If required by law, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time as shall be designated by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, which date shall be within thirteen months of the latest to occur of the organization of the corporation, its last annual meeting or the last action by written consent to elect directors in lieu of an annual meeting. At the annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect a board of directors and transact such other business as may be required by law or these by-laws or as may properly come before the meeting. 

  

 2.2. _ Special Meetings._ A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors. A special meeting of the stockholders shall be called by the secretary, or in the case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the secretary, by an assistant secretary or some other officer, upon written application of: (i) two or more directors or (ii) holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote. A special meeting of the holders of any class or series of stock shall be called by the secretary, or in the case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the secretary, by an assistant secretary or some other officer, upon written application of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series. Any such application shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Any such call shall state the place, if any, date, hour, and purposes of the special meeting. 

   

 2.3. _ Place of Meeting._ All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such place, if any, within or without the State of Delaware as may be determined from time to time by the chairman of the board, if any, the president or the board of directors. Any adjourned session of any meeting of the stockholders shall be held at the place, if any, designated in the vote of adjournment. 

  

 2.4. _ Notice of Meetings._ Except as otherwise provided by law, a notice of each meeting of stockholders stating the place, if any, date and hour thereof and, in the case of a special meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, and to each stockholder who, by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, is entitled to notice, and, if mailed, notice shall be given by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such stockholder at his, her or its address as it appears in the records of the corporation. Such notice shall be given by the secretary, or by an officer or person designated by the board of directors, or in the case of a special meeting by the officer calling the meeting. As to any adjourned session of any meeting of stockholders, notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken except that if the adjournment is for more than thirty days or if after the adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned session, notice of any      
  

such adjourned session of the meeting shall be given in the manner heretofore
described. No notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjourned session
thereof need be given to a stockholder if a written waiver of notice,
executed before or after the meeting or such adjourned session by such
stockholder, is filed with the records of the meeting or if the stockholder
attends such meeting without objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
meeting of the stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be specified
in any written waiver of notice.

  

 2.5. _ Quorum of Stockholders._ At any meeting of the stockholders a quorum as to any matter shall consist of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except where a larger quorum is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present. If a quorum is present at an original meeting, a quorum need not be present at an adjourned session of that meeting. Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; _provided, however,_ that the foregoing shall not limit the right of any corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 

  

 Stockholders may participate in a meeting of the stockholders by means of remote communication in accordance with applicable law. A stockholder participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting. 

  

 2.6. _ Action by Vote._ When a quorum is present at any meeting, a plurality of the votes properly cast for election of directors shall elect and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any question other than an election of directors shall decide the question, except when a larger vote is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election. 

  

 2.7. _ Action without Meetings._ Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders for or in connection with any corporate action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware by hand or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Each such written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless written consents signed by a number of stockholders sufficient to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner specified in this paragraph within sixty days of the earliest dated consent so delivered. 

  

 If action is taken by consent of stockholders and in accordance with the foregoing, there shall be filed with the records of the meetings of stockholders the writing or writings comprising such consent. 

  

 If action is taken by less than unanimous consent of stockholders, prompt notice of the taking of such action without a meeting shall be given to those who have not consented in writing and who otherwise would be entitled to notice of the meeting if the action was taken at a meeting and a certificate signed and attested to by the secretary that such notice was given shall be filed with the records of the meetings of stockholders. 

        
  

 In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, if such action had been voted upon by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision concerning a vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given under Section 228 of said General Corporation Law and that written notice has been given as provided in such Section 228\. 

  

 2.8. _ Proxy Representation._ Every stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a stockholder is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by such stockholder\'s attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally. The authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to specified action; _provided, however,_ that if a proxy limits its authorization to a meeting or meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof. 

  

 2.9. _ Inspectors._ The directors or the person presiding at the meeting may, and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors of election and any substitute inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them. 

  

 2.10. _ List of Stockholders._ The secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in such stockholder\'s name. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are stockholders entitled to examine such list or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

Each director shall file and maintain current with the secretary of the corporation his or her mailing, facsimile and email addresses. Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director if a written waiver of notice, executed by him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any director who attends the meeting without objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not duly called or convened.

Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as the act of the board or of such committee, as the case may be. 

  

 3.13. _ Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone._ Members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by such board, may participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other or by any other means permitted by law. Such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 

  

 3.14. _ Compensation._ In the discretion of the board of directors, each director may be paid such fees for his or her services as director (including as a member of one or more committees of the board of directors) and be reimbursed for his or her reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties as director as the board of directors from time to time may determine. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving reasonable compensation therefor.

 (1) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors or the committee, and the board

the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or

  

 (2) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or 

  

 (3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders. 

  

 (b) Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee that authorizes the contract or transaction. 

  

  

 3.16. _ Reliance Upon Books and Records._ A member of the board of directors, or a member of any committee designated by the board of directors shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the corporation by any of the corporation\'s officers, employees, agents, committees, or by any other person as to matters the member reasonably believes are within such other person\'s or persons\' professional or expert competence, and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the corporation.

 8.2. _ Record Date._ In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no such record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided, however,_ that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

  

 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no such record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware by hand or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by said General Corporation Law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 

        
  

 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such payment, exercise or other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.3, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the board of directors. 

  

 14.2. _ Prepayment of Expenses._ The corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 14 or otherwise. 

  

 14.3. _ Claims._ If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Section 14 is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. 

  

 14.4. _ Nonexclusivity of Rights._ The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Section 14 shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 14.5. _ Other Sources._ The corporation\'s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise. 

  

 14.6. _ Amendment or Repeal._ Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Section 14 shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
