7.2

|

Leakage 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.1

|

Provided that Closing has occurred, each Seller undertakes to pay an amount to
the Buyer in cash equal to the value or amount of: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any Leakage received by such Seller or any of its Affiliates; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

its pro rata portion in relation to the proceeds distributed to each Seller in
accordance with Appendix 4.2.2, of any Leakage which is not covered by Section
7.1.1(a) 

in each case less the amount of any Known Leakage which has already reduced
the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 4.1(b) but otherwise without any
deduction or set-off whatsoever.

| 
---|--- 

7.2.2

|

None of the provisions of Section 10.3 shall apply to a Leakage Claim,
provided however that each Seller's liability is individual, i.e. the Sellers'
liability shall not be joint, save that in respect of a Leakage Claim under
Section 7.2.1(b), Altor shall be jointly liable together with the Minority
Sellers, other than Kaupthing, but no Minority Seller shall be jointly liable
together with any other Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.3

|

The liability of each of the Sellers for Leakage Claims shall terminate twelve
months following Closing except in relation to any Leakage Claim of which
notice has previously been given to the Sellers. 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.4

|

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.2.3, nothing in this Agreement
shall have the effect of limiting, restricting or excluding the liability of a
Seller in respect of a Leakage Claim arising as a result of its or his or her
own fraud. 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.5

|

In the event that the Sellers disputes a Leakage Claim, the Sellers shall give
notice of the dispute to the Buyer stating the reasons for the dispute. If the
Sellers fail to provide such notice within five Business Days of the Buyer's
demand for payment, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the validity
of the Leakage Claim. The Buyer and the Sellers shall use all reasonable
efforts to resolve the dispute but if they have not resolved it within 20
Business Days of the date on which the Sellers' notice of dispute is delivered
to the Buyer, either the Sellers or the Buyer may refer the dispute to any
independent firm of chartered accountants (the "Independent Expert") on whose
appointment the Buyer and the Seller shall agree or, in default of such
agreement within five Business Days of any proposal for such appointment, as
shall be appointed by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce on the application of
either the Sellers Representative or the Buyer. The Independent Expert shall
determine only the Leakage Claim but not any dispute involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

7.2.6

|

The Independent Expert shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator, and its
decision shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. The fees
of the Independent Expert shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyer in equal
shares. If either of the Buyer or the Sellers shall fail to pay its share of
such fees, the other Party may in its absolute discretion pay such fees on the
defaulting Party's behalf and the defaulting Party shall immediately upon
demand reimburse the Party making the payment. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3

|

Restrictive Covenants 

| 
---|--- 

7.3.1

|

In consideration of the purchase of the Shares, each of Altor and Kaupthing

fully with the provisions of this Section 7.3. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3.2

|

Altor and Kaupthing shall not without the prior written consent of the Buyer
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld) for a period of two (2) years from
Closing (a) directly or indirectly carry on a Restricted Business, within the

conjunction with or on behalf of some other person) solicit or entice away
from any Group Company any of its directors or its Key Employees (who are
directors or Key Employees at the time of soliciting or enticing such person)
engaged in a technical, managerial, supervisory, sales or marketing capacity
otherwise than as a consequence of such person responding to advertisement
made to the general public advertising the position; and (c) have any business
dealings with (whether alone or in conjunction with or on behalf of some other
person) a supplier to any Group Company, if such dealings are carried out for
the purpose of causing such supplier to cease supplying, or materially reduce
its supply of goods or services to the Group. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3.3

|

Nothing in this Section 7.3 shall prevent Altor or Kaupthing from (a) owning
or acquiring for the purposes of investment not more than ten (10) per cent of
any class of shares or other securities of any undertaking, (b) owning,
acquiring or participating in a business or the shares or other securities of
any undertaking if that business or that undertaking's business is not
competing with or attempting to compete with the business carried on by the
Group as of the Closing Date, or (c) acquiring and retaining any business or
the shares or other securities of any undertaking if not more than 10 per cent
of that business or that undertaking's business is a Restricted Business or
the sole or principal reason for doing so is not the acquisition of an
interest in a Restricted Business; or (d) retaining any interest (including
increasing its interest to protect its pro rata ownership) in any competing
business held at Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3.4

|

Each of Altor and Kaupthing acknowledges that it considers that each of the
restrictions contained in Section 7.3 to be reasonable and are necessary for
the protection of the goodwill, know how, technical and confidential
information of each Group Company but if any such restriction shall be void or
voidable but would be valid and enforceable if some part or parts of it were
deleted, such restriction shall apply with such modification as may be
necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 

| 
---|--- 

7.3.5

|

Without limiting any other rights or remedies that the Buyer may have, each of
the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that damages alone may not be an adequate
remedy for any breach of the terms of this Section 7.3 by a Seller to which
such restrictions apply, and that the Buyer shall be entitled to seek remedies
of injunction, specific performance or other analogous from of relief for any
threatened or actual breach of this Section 7.3.

connection with the execution of the Transaction Documents or the completion
of the Transactions have been performed or obtained. This Agreement, and any

such person, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

|

8.3

|

Buyer's Knowledge

| 
---|--- 

8.4

|

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Covenants of the Buyer 

| 
---|--- 

9.1

|

The Buyer undertakes, subject to the respective auditors of the Group
Companies not recommending against discharge, to procure at the next annual
shareholders' meeting of each of the Group Companies that those board members
of the Group Companies who have resigned on or before the Closing Date and the
managing director or each Group Company (as applicable) are granted discharge
from liability for their administration up and until the date of their
respective resignation. 

| 
---|--- 

9.2

|

The Buyer shall within twenty (20) Business Days following the Closing Date

|

Liability 

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

Indemnification 

| 
---|--- 

10.1.1

|

Subject to Section 10.2, in the event of a breach of any of the Warranties or
the covenant in Section 7.1, the Buyer shall, as its sole and exclusive
remedy, be entitled to a reduction of the Purchase Price with an amount
corresponding to the Loss calculated on a USD-by-USD basis (i.e. not using
multiples to reflect such loss impact on the Purchase Price). It is
specifically agreed that the Sellers' liability in relation to the Shares is
exclusively governed by the Warranties and thus no remedy whatsoever under the
Sale of Goods Act (Sw. Koplagen) or under any other statute, law or legal
principle, including the right to rescind this Agreement, shall be available
to the Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

10.1.2

|

The Sellers hereby waive any claim that they may have against any of the
employees of the Group Companies that are not Sellers, relating to any
misrepresentation, inaccuracy or omission in or from any information or advice
supplied or given by that employee for the purpose of assisting the Sellers to
give any of the Warranties or to negotiate and prepare this Agreement. The
Sellers agree that such employee may enforce the benefit of the provisions of
this Section 10.1.2 in his or her or its own name whether or not the Buyer is
a party to the proceedings. 

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

RandW Insurance 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.1

|

The Buyer has entered into a representations and warranties insurance in the
name of the Buyer in respect of the Warranties with an insurance limit of USD
25,000,000 and an insurance retention in an amount of USD 1,000,000 (if such
amount is reached, any amount exceeding USD 500,000 shall be payable by the
RandW Insurer) and on the further terms and conditions set forth in Appendix
10.2.1 (the "RandW Insurance"). 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.2

|

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
Section 10.2.3 as between the Parties, the Buyer's sole remedy in case of a
breach of the Warranties shall be to seek compensation from the RandW Insurer,
and the Buyer shall not be entitled to pursue any action, make any Claim or
seek any recourse whatsoever against any of the Sellers for a breach of a
Warranty (regardless of whether the Buyer is compensated out of the RandW
Insurance or not). The Buyer undertakes to ensure that the RandW Insurer does
not have any claim or right of subrogation or recourse towards any Seller
except to the extent a Loss compensated under the RandW Insurance arises out of
fraud or wilful misconduct by such Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.3

|

Notwithstanding Section 10.2.2, the Buyer shall be entitled to seek
compensation from the relevant Sellers in respect of Claims for either fraud
by such Seller or a breach of the Fundamental Warranties in excess of the
higher of (i) the RandW insurance limit and (ii) USD 25,000,000, in which case
the Buyer may direct a Claim against the Sellers in breach for such excess,
however under no circumstances shall any individual Seller's liability
hereunder exceed the proceeds distributable to such Seller in accordance with
Appendix 4.2.2. 

| 
---|--- 

10.2.4

|

For the avoidance of doubt, if a representation and warranties insurance
policy is for any reason not obtained by the Buyer or is obtained but
subsequently terminated by either party thereto, or does not become effective,
the Buyer shall regardless of such circumstances, not have the right to make
any Claim against the Sellers, except as set out in Section 10.2.3. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

Limitation of Liability 

Each Seller's liability in respect of any breach of any of the Warranties,
covenants or agreements made or to be performed by the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement is subject to the following limitations:

| 
---|--- 

10.3.1

|

Each Seller's liability shall be individual, i.e. the Sellers' liability shall
not be joint. Claims made against the Sellers or a group of Sellers (for the
joint Warranties or where more than one Seller has breached the individual
Warranties) shall be allocated pro rata in relation to the proceeds
distributed to each Seller in accordance with Appendix 4.2.2. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.2

|

No Claim shall entitle the Buyer to a reduction of the Purchase Price unless
notice in writing of any such Claim (accompanied by reasonable particulars
thereof specifying the nature of the Claim and, as far as practicable, the
amount of the Claim) has been given to the Sellers within sixty (60) Business
Days from the date when the Buyer or, provided that Closing has occurred, the
relevant Group Company reasonably should have become aware of the
circumstances giving rise to the Claim and in any event no later than: (i) if
the Claim relates to the Fundamental Warranties or the Warranty in Section 6.7
(Taxes) within eighty four (84) months from the Closing Date; (ii) if the
Claim relates to any other Warranties within twenty four (24) months from the
Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.3

|

10.3.3 For the purposes of this Agreement, a liability, which is contingent,
shall not constitute a Loss unless and until such contingent liability becomes
an actual liability and is due and payable, provided that if written notice is
given while the Loss is contingent, indemnification may be sought once the
Loss materialises. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.4

|

Any Claim which may be made, which has not been previously satisfied, settled
or withdrawn, shall be deemed to have been waived and withdrawn twelve (12)
months subsequent to when notice of the Claim was served by the Buyer pursuant
Section 10.3.2, unless a notice of arbitration in respect thereof has been
served by the Buyer pursuant to Section 20 before the expiry of such twelve
(12) month period against the relevant Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.5

|

To the extent there are any corresponding savings by or net quantifiable
financial benefits to the Buyer or any Group Company arising from a Loss, the
Sellers shall not be liable for the portion of the Loss that is covered by
such saving or benefit. For example, if any Loss is a tax-deductible item or
relates to an untaxed reserve, the recoverable Loss shall be reduced by an
amount equivalent to the Loss multiplied by the actual corporate tax rate
applicable in the relevant jurisdiction of the Group Company (or, as the case
may be, the Buyer) during the relevant financial year. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.6

|

No Claim may be made and no liability shall arise if and to the extent that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

such Claim is based on facts, matters or circumstances which have been fairly
disclosed to the Buyer or its Representatives in the Disclosed Information, in
this Agreement, during the Due Diligence or otherwise through the information
disclosed to the Buyer or its Representatives, or that is otherwise known to
the Buyer or its Representatives or which was reasonably available to the
Buyer or its Representatives in generally available databases or public
records or any similar source in the jurisdiction of incorporation of any
Group Company, in each case (i) prior to Signing in relation to the Warranties
made on Signing, and (ii) prior to Closing in relation to the Warranties made
on Closing; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

a provision or allowance for the Loss has been made in the Accounts or the
Interim Financial Statements, or the same is otherwise taken into account or
reflected in the Accounts or the Interim Financial Statements; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

such Claim occurs as a result of: (i) the passing of or interpretation of any
legislation not in force at the Signing Date or which takes effect
retroactively; (ii) a change in generally accepted accounting principles not
in force at the Signing Date or which takes effect retroactively; (iii) an
increase in the tax rate in force on the Signing Date or which takes effect
retroactively; or (iv) a change in the generally established practices
(including interpretation of Applicable Law) of any government authority; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

such Claim is recoverable under an insurance policy or would have been
recoverable had the insurance protection level, which existed up to Closing,
been continued; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

such Loss has been recovered, or is recoverable, by the Buyer or its
Affiliates from any third party or to the extent such Loss has been, or is to
be, remedied by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates; 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

such Claim would not have arisen but for an act, omission (including a failure
to mitigate any loss) or transaction carried out by or upon the request of the
Buyer, or persons deriving title from the Buyer before or after the Closing
Date or any of the Group Companies after the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

the Buyer elects to only make a Claim against a single Seller or a limited
group of Sellers for a Claim which each Seller, or a wider group of Sellers,
could be made responsible for hereunder; and 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

in relation to the Warranties set out in Section 6.11 (Environment), such
Claim has arisen as a result of any measure caused or accelerated, directly or
indirectly, by the Buyer, its Affiliates or any Group Company (as concerns a
Group Company - following the Closing), by initiating any activities
(including, without limitation, procuring environmental audits or studies,
performing drillings or diggings, or approaching any authorities) unless such
activities are required to avoid imminent danger to human health or
consequences under criminal law, or in order to comply with a non-appealable
Order from an authority or a court. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.7

|

The Buyer shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies shall use
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Third Party Claims and Recovery 

| 
---|--- 

11.1.1

|

The Buyer shall in order to preserve its right to bring a Claim against the
Sellers upon the event of a Third Party Claim: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in no event later than forty (40) Business Days after the Buyer or (subject to
Closing having occurred) any Group Company becomes aware of the relevant fact
or set of circumstances, give notice thereof to the Seller Representative; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

give the Seller Representative full access to the personnel of the Buyer
and/or the relevant Group Company, as the case may be, and to any relevant
premises, accounts, documents and records within their respective possession,
and to take copies thereof, in order to enable the Sellers to examine the
basis of any potential Third Party Claim; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

subject to the Seller Representative (on behalf of the relevant Seller(s)) or
the relevant Seller in writing accepting full liability for the Third Party
Claim (to the extent the Buyer is entitled to bring a Claim against such
Seller): 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

not make any admission of liability and not agree to settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim with any person, body or authority in relation thereto,
without obtaining the prior written consent of the Seller Representative; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

upon the Seller Representative's request, allow the Sellers the right to
dispute and defend such Third Party Claim in the name of the relevant Group
Company, which shall include the right to make any counterclaim available to
the relevant Group Company, and to properly conduct any litigation resulting
therefrom. 

| 
---|--- 

11.1.2

|

If the Sellers make any payment to the Buyer as a settlement of a Claim and
the Buyer or any of the Group Companies have the right to recover or receives
recovery from a third party any amount that has formed the basis of such
Claim, the Buyer shall be deemed hereunder to have assigned such right to
recovery to the Seller Representative, or if such amounts were received,
immediately transfer such funds to such bank account as designated by the
Seller Representative. 

| 
---|--- 

12.

|
