_Significant Stockholder_ " and collectively the " _Significant Stockholders_
") and (v) Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company solely in its capacity as Stockholders Representative (as
defined herein). Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Significant Stockholders
and the Stockholders Representative are referred to herein individually as a
" _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to such terms as set
forth in _Appendix A_ hereto.

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the
Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of such corporations and
their respective stockholders that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company with the Company being the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ "),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , such Boards of Directors have approved the Merger, pursuant to
which among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company and
all options, warrants and other rights to acquire or receive any shares of
capital stock of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration set forth herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a material inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, (i) each of the employees identified on _Appendix B-1_ (the " _Key
Signing Employees_ ") shall have entered into an employment arrangement with
Parent or a subsidiary thereof to be effective as of the Closing Date (as
defined below) pursuant to his or her execution of an offer letter, a non-
disclosure agreement and a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement in
forms provided to the Company by Parent (such offer letters and agreements,
the " _Key Employee Agreements_ "), (ii) each of the stakeholders of the
Company identified on Appendix B-2 shall have entered into a non-competition
and non-solicitation agreement in forms provided to the Company by Parent
(such agreements, the " _Key Stakeholder Agreements_ "), and (iii) each Person
who may receive any payments and/or benefits referred to in Section 6.12(e)
hereof has executed and delivered to the Company a 280G Waiver, substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (a " _280G Waiver_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , approval of the principal terms of the Merger requires the
Requisite Vote, and immediately after the execution and delivery hereof, the
Company shall submit this Agreement and the Merger to the Stockholders for
approval by written consent in lieu of a special meeting of the Stockholders
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties, and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL,
(i) Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be
governed by the DGCL as a (directly or indirectly) wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, and (iii) the separate existence of the Company with all of its
assets, property rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall
continue unaffected by the Merger.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_. As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), but no earlier than
October 1, 2013, the Parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by (i) filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in
such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, which Certificate of Merger shall be substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, and (ii) making such other filings
and taking such other actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger
effective hereinafter. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time
as the Certificate of Merger is accepted for filing by with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as may be
permitted or required by the DGCL and specified in the Certificate of Merger
by mutual agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (the date and time
the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, in the Certificate of Merger and in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the assets,
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and without
any further action on the part of the Parties, (i) the certificate of
incorporation of the Merger Sub shall be amended so as to be in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ and (ii) the bylaws of the Merger Sub in

Parents revenue recognition policy (as reported in Parents 10K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2012), plus any
deferred revenue as of December 31, 2014 for shipments that were made and
invoiced in calendar year 2014 in accordance with the terms of the purchase
orders evidencing such shipments.

 



 

(d) Beginning with the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2014 through the
calendar quarter ending September 30, 2014, within thirty (30) days following
the end of each quarter Parent shall provide to the Stockholders
Representative quarterly written reports indicating the Company Gross Margin

thirty (30) days after receipt of a Quarterly Report, if the Stockholders
Representative requests a meeting with representatives of Parent to discuss
such report, Parent shall make available for such a meeting those of its
executive officers who are responsible for the applicable activities set forth
in such Quarterly Report. On or before February 15, 2015, the Parent shall
cause to be prepared a statement (the " _Performance Statement_ ") that shall
set forth the amount of the Performance Payment, if any, and the calculation
thereof, including the Company Gross Margin and the Company Revenue, in each
case for the Performance Period, and shall deliver such Performance Statement
to the Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(e) If the Stockholders Representative disputes any amount set forth in the
Performance Statement, the Stockholders Representative will notify Parent in
writing of any disagreement the Stockholders Representative has with the
Performance Statement within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Performance
Statement. Any such notification shall specify in reasonable detail those
items, components, amounts or calculations as to which the Stockholders
Representative disagrees. In the event that the Stockholders Representative
does not notify Parent of such disagreement during such thirty (30) day period
or if Parent receives a written notice from the Stockholders Representative
irrevocably accepting the calculation of the Performance Payment set forth in
the Performance Statement, the Performance Statement shall be deemed accepted
by the Stockholders Representative and shall be final and binding on all
Parties and the Participating Holders shall have no further rights to disagree
therewith, and within five (5) business days after such acceptance, subject to
the payment provisions in Section 1.9 in the case of payments to holders of
Company Options, Parent shall deposit by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, pursuant to an Allocation Certificate received by Parent with
respect to such payment: (i) with the Payments Administrator an amount of cash
equal to the portion of the Performance Payment payable to Participating
Holders for whom the payment of the Performance Payment is not subject to wage
or payroll tax withholding; and (ii) with the Surviving Corporations (or
other Affiliates) payroll agent an amount of cash equal to the portion of the
Performance Payment

of the Performance Payment is subject to wage or payroll tax withholding.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Stockholders Representative shall notify Parent of
any disagreement the Stockholders Representative has with the Performance
Statement pursuant to Section 1.8(e), then within a further period of ten (10)
days from the date Parent receives such dispute notice from the Stockholders
Representative, the Parties will attempt to resolve in good faith any disputed
items and such resolution and any required adjustments resulting therefrom
shall be final and binding on the Parties. In the event that Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall be unable to agree upon a joint
determination of the Performance Statement within ten (10) days from the date
Parent receives such dispute notice from the Stockholders Representative,
then within five (5) days after the expiration of such ten (10) day period,
Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall submit the dispute to the
Accounting Firm. Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall request
that the Accounting Firm render its determination prior to the expiration of
thirty (30) days after the dispute is submitted to it, and such determination
and any required adjustments resulting therefrom shall be final and binding on
all the Parties hereto. The Accounting Firm shall be acting as an arbitrator
and not as an auditor and shall decide only those issues as to which the
Parties are not in agreement. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be allocated to be paid by Parent and/or the Stockholders
Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders), respectively, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the total amount contested and not
awarded to such party bears to the total amount contested, as determined by
the Accounting Firm.

 



 

(g) Parent shall maintain a system of accounting records which allows Parent
to calculate Company Gross Margin and Company Revenue and notwithstanding any
integration of the Companys operations with and into Parent, its current
and/or future Affiliates and their respective operations or any reorganization
or other transaction or series of transactions effected by Parent after the
Closing. Nothing in this Agreement creates a fiduciary duty on the part of
Parent or any of Parents Affiliates to any Stockholder in respect of the
Performance Payment.

 



 

(h) From the Closing Date until December 31, 2014, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates (i) not to
remove Key Employees from the Surviving Corporation (except in the case of a
termination for Cause), (ii) not to impose allocated corporate spend (provided
however, this shall not prohibit charges for the actual expenses of Parent-
supplied resources working directly with the divisional management) and (iii)
operate the Surviving Corporation in a commercially reasonable manner and
shall not take any action to intentionally reduce or hinder the achievement of
any Initial Order Cash Consideration or Performance Payment.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that on or prior to December 31, 2014, (i) a Change of Control of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation occurs; (ii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation
commences any proceeding in bankruptcy or for dissolution, liquidation,
winding-up, or other relief under state or federal bankruptcy laws (a
"Bankruptcy Proceeding"); (iii) a Bankruptcy Proceeding is commenced against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or a substantial part of their respective
property, and such proceeding or appointment is not dismissed or discharged
within sixty (60) days after its commencement; (iv) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation is unable to, or admits in writing its inability to, pay its debts
when they become due; (v) Parent or the Surviving Corporation makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or petitions or applies to any
tribunal for the appointment of a custodian, receiver or trustee for it or a
substantial portion of its assets or has a receiver, custodian or trustee
appointed for all or a substantial portion of its assets, or (vi) Parent or
the Surviving Corporation takes any action effectuating, approving or
consenting to any of the foregoing, then in each case, 100% of the unpaid
Initial Order Cash Consideration and Performance Payments shall become due and
payable

 



      
 

 



 

immediately upon the occurrence of any such event, to the extent not
previously paid. "Change of Control" shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation into or with any Person in a
transaction or series of related transactions that results in more than 50% of
the voting securities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the surviving,
resulting or parent entity in such transaction or series of related
transactions that are outstanding immediately after the consummation thereof
being beneficially owned by Persons other than those Persons that
(individually or collectively) beneficially owned such voting securities of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, immediately prior to the
consummation thereof; or (ii) a sale or other disposition of a material amount
of the assets or voting securities of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

after receipt of the Final Balance Sheet to notify Parent of its election to
review, at the expense of the Participating Holders, the computations set
forth in the Final Balance Sheet and the Statement of Closing Liabilities.
Prior to the end of such twenty (20) day period, the Stockholders
Representative shall notify Parent in writing of any disagreement the
Stockholders Representative has with the Final Balance Sheet or the Statement
of Closing Liabilities (a " _Notice_ "). Any such Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail those items, components, amounts or calculations as to which
the Stockholders Representative disagrees, the Stockholders Representatives
alternative items, components, amounts or calculations and the basis therefor,
and attach any relevant supporting documentation. In the event a Notice is not
provided to Parent by the Stockholders Representative during such twenty (20)
day period, the Final Balance Sheet and the Statement of Closing Liabilities,
and the Post-Closing Adjustment resulting therefrom, shall be deemed accepted
by the Stockholders Representative and final and binding on the Parties
hereto and the Participating Holders shall have no further right to disagree
therewith. In the event that the Stockholders Representative shall provide a
timely and valid Notice to Parent during such twenty (20) day period, Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall promptly (and in any event within
thirty (30) days following the date upon which the Stockholders
Representative delivers such Notice), attempt to make a joint determination of
the Post-Closing Adjustments and such determination and any required
adjustments resulting therefrom shall be final and binding on the Parties
hereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the event the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall be unable
to agree upon a joint determination of the Post-Closing Adjustments within
thirty (30) days after delivery by the Stockholders Representative of the
Notice (or any mutually agreed upon extension of such period), then Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall promptly submit the dispute to the
Accounting Firm to make a final and binding determination of only those items,
components, amounts or calculations of Merger Consideration, Final Net Working
Capital and Final Closing Liabilities as to which the Stockholders
Representative has disagreed in the Notice validly and timely delivered and
continues to disagree. The Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by Parent on the
Final Balance Sheet or the Stockholders Representative on the Notice, or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by Parent on the Final Balance
Sheet or the Stockholders Representative on the Notice. The Accounting Firm
shall be acting as an arbitrator and not as an auditor and shall decide only
those issues as to which the Parties are not in agreement. Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall request that the Accounting Firm render its
determination prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after the dispute is
submitted and such determination and any required adjustments resulting
therefrom shall be final and binding on all the Parties hereto. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to be paid by Parent and/or
the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders),
respectively, based upon the percentage which the portion of the total amount
contested and not awarded to such party bears to the total amount contested,
as determined by the Accounting Firm.

 



 

(d) If the Final Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 1.13 is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then Parent shall have the right to offset the amount thereof against
any portion of the Merger Consideration owed to the Participating Holders (as
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration), including, without limitation, the
Escrow Amount, and any interest accrued thereon. If the Final Net Working
Capital as finally determined in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 1.13 is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, within five
(5) business days after such determination, subject to the payment provisions
in Section 1.9 in the case of payments to holders of Company Options, Parent
shall deposit by wire transfer in immediately available funds, pursuant to an
Allocation Certificate received by Parent with respect to such payment: (i)
with the Payments Administrator an amount of cash equal to the portion of the
amount thereof payable to Participating Holders for whom the payment of such
amount is not subject to wage or payroll tax withholding; and (ii) with the
Surviving Corporations (or other Affiliates) payroll agent an amount of cash
equal to the portion of the amount thereof payable to the Participating
Holders for whom such payment is subject to wage or payroll tax withholding.

 



 

(e) If the Indebtedness and/or the Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities determined
pursuant to this Section 1.13 exceed the Indebtedness and/or the Non-Ordinary
Course Liabilities, respectively, set forth on the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, then Parent shall have the right to offset the amount thereof against
any portion of the Merger Consideration owed to the Participating Holders (as
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration), including, without limitation, the
Escrow Amount, and any interest accrued thereon. If the Indebtedness and/or
the Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities determined pursuant to this Section 1.13
are less than the Indebtedness and/or the Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities,
respectively, set forth on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, within five
(5) business days after such determination, subject to the payment provisions
in Section 1.9 in the case of payments to holders of Company Options, Parent
shall deposit by wire transfer in immediately available funds, pursuant to an
Allocation Certificate received by Parent with respect to such payment: (i)
with the Payments Administrator an amount of cash equal to the portion of the
amount of such surplus payable to Participating Holders for whom the payment
of such amount is not subject to wage or payroll tax withholding; and (ii)
with the Surviving Corporations (or other Affiliates) payroll agent an
amount of cash equal to the portion of such surplus payable to the
Participating Holders for whom such payment is subject to wage or payroll tax
withholding.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall effect the _net_ result
of the adjustments described in Sections 1.13(d) and (e), which shall be
referred to collectively as the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_."

 



 

1.14 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. If (i) at least three (3) business days prior to
the Closing Date Parent has received the following from any Participating
Holder: (x) a photocopy or facsimile of each certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6 (the " _Certificates_ ")
held by such Participating Holder, if any, (y) a photocopy or facsimile of a
letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and (z) a photocopy or facsimile of such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to the instructions set forth
in the Letter of Transmittal, and (ii) in connection with the Closing, Parent
receives an original Certificate or Certificates held by such Participating
Holder, if any, a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to the instructions in the
Letter of Transmittal, then on the Closing Date in accordance with such Letter
of Transmittal, Parent shall deliver: (x) to any such Participating Holder for
whom the payment of Merger Consideration is not subject to wage or payroll tax
withholding in exchange therefor the applicable the Merger Consideration
payable at Closing in accordance with the terms hereof; and (y) to the
Surviving Corporations (or other Affiliates) payroll agent an amount of cash
equal to the portion of applicable Merger Consideration payable at the Closing
to the Participating Holders for whom such payment is subject to wage or
payroll tax withholding, and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If Parent has received such materials from any such Participating
Holder later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, then
Parent shall deliver to such Participating Holder in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration no later than three (3) business days after
such receipt or three (3) business days after the date on which such Merger
Consideration is otherwise due hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof,
whichever is later. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Stock
represented by such Certificate. Any Participating Holder who has not complied
with this Agreement shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as a general creditor
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Stock, without any interest thereon. Parent shall
provide the Stockholders Representative and the Payments Administrator upon
reasonable request with (i) a list (updated prior to each post-closing
payment) of all Participating Holders that have properly presented all of the
above-required transmittal information and documents and are eligible to
receive Merger Consideration and (ii) copies of all such transmittal documents
(including payment information) and tax documents in Parents possession.

 



 

(b) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to a holder of a Certificate for any applicable Merger Consideration or
any other amount due that was properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(c) _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Company, the Payments Administrator and
the Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Participating Holder such amounts as are reasonably determined by Parent, the
Company or the Payments Administrator to be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such

 



      
 

 



 

withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Participating Holder in respect of whom such deduction,
withholding and remittance were made. Parent and the Escrow Agent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate any required backup
withholding under Section 3406 of the Code by requesting Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable from the Participating Holders,
and shall provide copies of such documents to the Payments Administrator upon
reasonable request.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the holder of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to indemnify and hold harmless Parent from and against
any losses in connection therewith (but, for the avoidance of doubt, may not
require a bond).

 



 

1.15 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The applicable portion of
Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock. At
the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and thereafter there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares
of Company Stock on the records of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.16 _Dissenting Shares_. Any holder of shares of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which
dissenters rights, if any, are available by reason of the Merger pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the DGCL who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who complies with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be entitled to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I,
unless such holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses its
dissenters rights under the DGCL. Such holder shall be entitled to receive
only such rights as are granted under the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
If any such holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or loses such
dissenters rights under the DGCL, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to which such shares of Company Stock are
entitled pursuant to this Article I, without interest. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the DGCL received by the Company, withdrawals of any such
demands and any other documents or instruments received by the Company in
connection therewith. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing. Any payments made with respect to Dissenting Shares
shall be made solely by the Surviving Corporation, and no funds or other
property have been or shall be provided by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
Parents Affiliates for such payment.

 



 

1.17 _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable
or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either the
Company or Merger Sub, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or
their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Merger Sub, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to
vest, perfect or confirm its

 



       
 

 



 

rights, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges,
powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company or Merger Sub, as
applicable, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
CLOSING**

 



 

2.1 _Time and Place of the Closing_. The Closing shall take place by remote
exchange of documents, unless another method or place is agreed to in writing
by the Parties, as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII hereof and in any event
within three (3) business days thereafter (but no earlier than October 1,
2013), or on such other date as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company may

Parent the various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in
Section 6.11 below, and (ii) Parent and the Merger Sub will deliver to the

2.3 _Stockholders  Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Participating Holder, by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger by the Participating Holders (regardless of whether or
not all Participating Holders vote in favor of or consent to the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and regardless of whether at a meeting or in an action by
written consent in lieu thereof), designates Shareholder Representative
Services LLC (the " _Stockholders  Representative_") as his, her or its
representative for purposes of this Agreement. The Participating Holders and
their respective successors shall be deemed to have approved, and shall be
bound by, any and all actions taken by the Stockholders Representative on
their behalf under or otherwise relating to this Agreement and the other
documents contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder as if such actions were expressly ratified and confirmed by each of
them in writing. In the event any Stockholders Representative is unable or
unwilling to serve or shall resign, a successor Stockholders Representative
shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Closing. A Stockholders
Representative may not resign, except upon 30 days prior written notice to
Parent and Merger Sub. In the event of a notice of proposed resignation, or
any death, disability or other replacement of a Stockholders Representative,
a successor shall be appointed effective immediately thereafter (and, in the
case of a death of a Stockholders Representative, the successor shall be
deemed to be the executor or other representative of such Stockholders
Representatives estate) and Parent and Merger Sub shall be notified promptly
of such appointment by the successor Stockholders Representative. No
replacement of any Stockholders Representative shall be effective against
Parent or Merger Sub until (i) the proposed successor Stockholders
Representative assumes in writing all obligations of the original
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement and (ii) Parent and Merger
Sub have consented to the proposed successor Stockholders Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each successor
Stockholders Representative shall have all the power, rights, authority and
privileges hereby conferred upon the original Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely upon any actions,
communication or writings taken, given or executed by the Stockholders
Representative on behalf of the Participating Holders. After the Closing, all
communications or writings to be sent to the Participating Holders pursuant to
this Agreement may be addressed to the Stockholders Representative and any
communication or writing so sent shall be deemed notice to all of the
Stockholders hereunder. The

 



      
 

 



 

adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of the Company Stock
shall constitute the consent and agreement of each of the Stockholders that
the Stockholders Representative is authorized to accept deliveries, including
any notice, on behalf of each holder of Company Stock pursuant hereto.

 



 

(c) The Stockholders Representative is hereby appointed and constituted the
true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Participating Holder, with full power
of substitution in such holders name and on such holders behalf to act
according to the terms of this Agreement and the other documents contemplated
hereby in the absolute discretion of the Stockholders Representative; and in
general to do all things and to perform all acts including, without
limitation, executing and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts,
instructions, notices and other instruments contemplated by or deemed
advisable in connection with this Agreement and the other documents
contemplated hereby, including without limitation Article IX hereof. This
power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted in
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements made herein, and shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Participating Holder
or operation of law, whether by such holders death or disability or by any
other event.

 



 

(d) The Stockholders Representative hereby agrees to serve as the
Stockholders Representative in accordance with the applicable terms hereof
and to be bound by such terms.

 



 

(e) The Stockholders Representative will incur no liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Stockholders Representative in
connection with the Stockholders Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and that certain Acquiom MandA Payments
Agreement (the " _Acquiom Payments Agreement_ ") to be entered into at or
prior to Closing by and among Acquiom Administration LLC (the " _Payments
Administrator_ "), the Stockholders Representative and the Company, except in
the event of liability directly resulting from the Stockholders
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Participating
Holders will severally (based on each Participating Holders Pro Rata
Proportion but not jointly indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Stockholders Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Stockholders Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Acquiom Payments Agreement, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders Representative will reimburse
the Participating Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Stockholders Representative by the Participating
Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholders
Representative (i) first, from the funds in the Expense Fund, (ii) second,
solely to the extent the remaining funds available to the Stockholders
Representative in the Expense Fund are insufficient, from either (A) the
amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Participating Holders or (B) any future contingent
consideration at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Participating Holders, and (iii) third, solely to the
extent the remaining funds in the Expense Fund are insufficient and there are
insufficient funds immediately available to the Stockholders Representative
from the Escrow Fund and/or contingent consideration, from the Participating
Holders directly; provided, that while this section allows the Stockholders
Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund, the Escrow Fund and any other
future contingent consideration, this does not (i) require the Stockholders
Representative to wait for future releases of funds from the Escrow Fund or
future payments of contingent consideration before recovering directly from
the Participating Holders, (ii) relieve the Participating Holders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, or (iii) prevent the

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholders Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law
or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Participating Holders or otherwise. The
Participating Holders acknowledge and agree that the limitations set forth in
Section 9.5 are not applicable to the indemnification provided in this Section
2.3(e), and that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or
removal of the Stockholders Representative or the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(f) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire to the Stockholders
Representative an aggregate amount of US$250,000 (the " _Expense Fund_ "). The
Participating Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholders Representative
any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. Within five (5) business days after the completion of the
Stockholders Representatives responsibilities under this Agreement subject
to the payment provisions in Section 1.9 in the case of payments to holders of
Company Options, the Stockholders Representative shall deposit by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, pursuant to an Allocation
Certificate: (i) with the Payments Administrator an amount of cash equal to
the portion of the then balance of the Expense Fund payable to Participating
Holders for whom the payment of the balance of the Expense Fund is not subject
to wage or payroll tax withholding; and (ii) with the Surviving Corporations
(or other Affiliates (at the direction of Parent)) payroll agent an amount of
cash equal to the portion of the then remaining balance of the Expense Fund
payable to Participating Holders for whom the payment of the balance of the
Expense Fund is subject to wage or payroll tax withholding. For tax purposes,
the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Participating Holders at the time of Closing and shall be subject
to wage withholding as if paid to such Participating Holders on the Closing
Date to the extent wage withholding is required by law; provided, that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Stockholders
Representative nor the Payments Administrator shall be responsible for any
wage withholding or related calculations or determinations.

3.5 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.5(a)_ includes true, complete and correct copies of (i) the
Year-End Financials and (ii) the Interim Financials. Each of the Financial
Statements (including in all cases the notes thereto, if any) is consistent
with the Companys books and records, free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, presents fairly the Companys and each of its
Subsidiary financial condition and results of operations as of the times and
for the periods referred to therein, and has been prepared in accordance with
GAAP. During the periods covered by the Financial Statements and since the
Balance Sheet Date, there has been no material change in the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries accounting policies. Except as disclosed therein or in
_Schedule 3.5(a)_ hereto, there are no material, special or non-recurring
items of income or expense during the periods covered by the Financial
Statements and the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements do not
reflect any write-up or revaluation increasing the book value of any assets.
All revenues recognized by the Company have been recognized in accordance with
GAAP. There have been no transactions involving the business of the Company
which properly should have been set forth in the Financial Statements and
which have not been accurately so set forth. _Schedule 3.5(a)_ sets forth a

Company and each of its Subsidiaries (including those accounts receivable
reflected on the Balance Sheet or arising since the Balance Sheet Date that
have not yet been collected) (i) represent valid obligations of customers of
the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, arising from bona fide
transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) are
current and, to the knowledge of, the Company, there is no reason to expect
that such accounts receivable will not be collected in full, without any
counterclaim or set off, when due (and in no event later than nine (9) months
after the Closing Date).

 



 

(c) The accounts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries: (i)
have recorded therein the results of operations and the assets and liabilities
of the Company, required to be reflected under GAAP and (ii) are free from

regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries, and its and their financial condition
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the appropriate

weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys
or its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and there is no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or, to the knowledge of the Company, other employees who
have a significant role in the Companys or its Subsidiaries internal
controls and the Company has provided to Parent copies of any written
materials relating to the foregoing.

complete breakdown and aging as of the Balance Sheet Date of all accounts

Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or similar provisions of state law.

 



 

(e) Each Company Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract or fund) has
been maintained, funded and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its governing instruments and all applicable laws including
ERISA and the Code. All payments by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof
required by any Company Plan, by any collective bargaining agreement or by
applicable law (including all employee and employer contributions, insurance

attributable to any such Company Plan for any period prior to the Closing Date
have been or will be accrued on the Companys consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP and, except to the extent of such accruals,
the Company has no Liability arising

 



      
 

 



 

out of or in connection with the form or operation of the Company Plans or
benefits accrued thereunder on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and
each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has either received and is entitled to rely upon a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS with respect to such
Company Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect such determination or opinion. All amendments required to

(i) Benefits under each Company Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit
plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, with the exception of any
medical expense reimbursement arrangements subject to Sections 105 and 125 of
the Code) are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies
issued by an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or similar
organization unrelated to the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, the
premiums for which are paid directly by the Company or its ERISA Affiliates
from its general assets or partly from its general assets and partly from
contributions by its employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to
any such Company Plan requires or permits retroactive increase in premiums or
payments due thereunder.

 



 

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event (where such event would
not alone have an effect described in this sentence), conflict with or result
in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification
or acceleration of any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
loss of any benefit under any Company Plan, trust or loan that will or may
result in any payment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), require funding, acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to fund benefits with respect to any

beneficiaries, or any other material liability for the Company or Parent.

 



 

(k) Each Company Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued

for benefits protected under Section 411(d) of the Code or Section 204(g) of
ERISA and other than ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a
termination event). None of the Company Plans will be subject to any surrender
fees, market value adjustment, deferred sales charges, commissions, or other
fees or charges upon termination other than the normal and reasonable
administrative fees associated with their amendment, transfer or termination.
The Company may, without cost, withdraw their employees, directors, officers
and consultants from any employee benefit plan in which the Company is a
participating employer or which the Company does not sponsor.

 



 

(l) Each Company Plan, employment agreement, or other contract, plan, program,
agreement, or arrangement that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code, its Treasury regulations,
and any administrative guidance relating thereto; and no additional Tax under
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be
incurred by a participant in any such Company Plan, employment agreement, or
other contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. The Company is not a
party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement that provides for the gross-up of Taxes imposed by Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. No Company Option or other right to acquire Company

contributes to, or is obligated to contribute to, any material employment,

material plan, policy, fund, program or arrangement or contract, including
multiemployer plan, retirement savings, superannuation, pension, severance,
employment, change-in-control, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation and any other employee benefit plan, agreement, program, policy
or other arrangement that is maintained outside the United States primarily
for the benefit of Persons substantially all of whom are "nonresident aliens"
within the meaning of Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA.

 



 

(n) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any plan or commitment to
adopt, establish or enter into any new Company Plan, to modify any Company
Plan (except to the extent required by law or to conform any such Company Plan
to the requirements of any Applicable Law, in each case as previously
disclosed to Parent in writing, or as required by this Agreement).

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed (or has had filed on
its behalf) on a timely basis all material, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, all other Tax Returns that it is required to have filed. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested or obtained any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has not since been
filed. All Tax Returns filed by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
true, correct and complete in all material respects and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there are no other inaccuracies that would be reasonably expected
to have a material negative effect on either future Tax obligations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Tax compliance by the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has ever participated in a "Tax amnesty" or similar program
offered by any Taxing Authority to avoid the assessment of any Tax.

 



 

(b) All Taxes required to have been paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid on a
timely basis. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
Liability for Taxes not yet required to have been paid, other than Liabilities
for Taxes reflected on the Balance Sheet or incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the Balance Sheet Date. There are no Encumbrances on any of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) timely to pay any Tax.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied in all respects with
all applicable Laws relating to withholding and collection of Taxes and
information reporting with respect to such Taxes, and has, within the time and
manner prescribed by Law, withheld or collected from employee wages and other
payments and paid over to the proper Taxing Authority all such withheld or
collected amounts required to have been paid. To the knowledge of the Company,
the records of the Company and its Subsidiaries contain all information and
documents reasonably expected to be necessary to comply in all material
respects with applicable Tax information reporting and Tax withholding
requirements under applicable Laws and such records reasonably required to
identify with specificity all accounts subject to backup withholding under
Section 3406 of the Code. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has

 



      
 

 



 

complied in all material respects with all sales Tax resale certificate
exemption requirements for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
either claimed such an exemption or not collected sales Tax from another
Person in reliance on a purchase for resale exemption.

 



 

(d) No written claim has ever been received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from a Taxing Authority for a jurisdiction where neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries files Tax Returns that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction or
has an obligation to file Tax Returns, in each case with respect to any Tax of
a type for which such entity did not file a Tax Return with, or pay Tax
imposed by, such jurisdiction of such type for the most recently ended taxable
period for which such a Tax payment or Tax Return was due. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has conducted activities in any jurisdiction which
will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay Tax or file any Tax
Return in such jurisdiction of a type that was not required to have been paid
or filed by it in the most recently ended previous taxable period for which
such type of Tax or Tax Return would be due (as reflected in _Schedule
3.10(e)_ ).

audit by a Taxing Authority, and all such income Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as to which the statute of limitations for assessments
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of additional Tax for the
taxable period covered thereby has not yet expired. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have provided or made available to Parent complete and accurate
copies of all of the following materials: (i) all income Tax Returns and other
material tax Returns filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) all
examination reports relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) all statements of Taxes assessed against or agreed to by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that were not shown on Tax Returns
filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before such assessment or
agreement and all related correspondence; (iv) all written rulings from, and
written agreements with, any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) all elections relating to Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries which would have continuing effect in the
determination of Tax or preparation of any Tax Return of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any taxable period for which a Tax Return has not yet
been filed or Tax paid (other than elections that are included in or apparent
from Tax Returns referred to in clause (i) above); (vi) any request for
issuance of any ruling from a Tax Authority on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary since formation (regardless of whether the requested ruling was
issued) and (vii) to the extent reasonably requested in writing by Parent, any
other document relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than documents that the Company has advised Parent in
writing that it is unable to provide or for which less than three (3) business
days have elapsed since the date of such request).

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has a "permanent
establishment" in any country other than the country under the Laws of which
it is organized (as such term is defined in any applicable Tax treaty or
convention between the relevant country of organization and such other
country) and has not otherwise engaged in activity that is reasonably likely
to have exposed it to the taxing jurisdiction of any such other country with
respect to a material Tax Liability. The Company and each Subsidiary is in
material compliance with the terms and conditions of any existing Tax
exemptions granted by, Tax agreements with or Tax orders of any Taxing
Authority to which it may be subject, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
the consummation of the Merger is not expected to be inconsistent with
continued compliance with the terms and conditions of any such exemptions,
agreements or orders.

 



 

(g) Any and all transactions between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on the one hand and any other controlled Persons (within the
meaning of Section 482 of the

 



      
 

 



 

Code) have at all times occurred on arms-length terms, as if between and
among unrelated parties. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has properly
and in a timely manner documented in all material respects its transfer
pricing methodology in compliance with Section 6662(e) (and any related
sections) of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and any
comparable provisions of U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Person on behalf
of the Company or any its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations
or agreed to any extension of time that has continuing effect with respect to
assessment or collection of any Tax for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may be held liable. There is not currently in effect any power of
attorney authorizing any Person to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or receive information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, with respect to any Tax matter (other than authorizations to
contact Tax Return preparers included in Tax Returns previously filed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries). There is no audit or other Proceeding
presently pending or threatened in writing (or to the Companys knowledge,
otherwise) with regard to any Tax Liability or Tax Return of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
existing circumstances that reasonably may be expected to result in the
assertion of a material claim for unsatisfied Tax obligations against the
Company or its Subsidiaries by any Taxing Authority with respect to any
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date for
which Tax Returns are required to have been filed or Tax is required to have
been paid or withheld or collected by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(i) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.10(i)_ , and except for payments of
benefits that are payable to an individual that has signed a 280G Waiver,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or have made or become
obligated to make, or will as a result of any event connected directly or
indirectly with any transaction contemplated herein become obligated to make,
any "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Code (without
regard to Subsection (b)(4) thereof) and no amount that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or any other event, by
any employee, officer, director, stockholder or other service provider of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan or otherwise would
not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to
an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. There is no written or unwritten
agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract by which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound to compensate or provide a Tax gross-up payment for
any individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.
_Schedule 3.10(i)_ identifies each "disqualified individual" as defined in
Section 280G of the Code (each a " _Potential Parachute Recipient_ ") to whom
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made any payments or provided any
benefit, or who is a party to an agreement that could obligate the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to make any payment or provide any benefit, that alone
or together could constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or agreed to
make, has requested permission to make, or is required to make, any change in
method of accounting previously used by it in any Tax Return filed by it which
change in method would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make
an adjustment to its income pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision) on any Tax Return for any taxable period ending on or after
the Closing Date for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has not yet
filed a Tax Return; nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received
any written notice (or to the knowledge of the Company, any other notice) that
a Taxing Authority proposes to require a change in method of accounting used
in any Tax Return which has been filed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action not
in accordance with past practice that would have the effect of deferring a
material measure of Tax from a period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date to a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has material
deferred income or Tax Liability arising out of any transaction, except to the
extent adequately reserved for on its Balance Sheet, including without
limitation, (i) the disposition of any property in a transaction accounted for
under the installment method pursuant to Section 453 of the Code, (ii) the use
of the long-term contract method of accounting or (iii) the receipt of any
prepaid amount on or before the Closing Date (other than receipts after the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior
practice as reflected by reserves on the Balance Sheet for Taxes related to
prepayments of a similar type).

Subsidiaries is (i) "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section
168(h)(1) of the Code, (ii) "tax-exempt bond financed property" within the
meaning of Section 168(g) of the Code, (iii) or, as to the Company, used
predominately outside the United States within the meaning of Section
168(g)(1)(A) of the Code, or as to any Subsidiary, used outside the country
under the Laws of which it was organized. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement under which it is treated as a lessor
or lessee of "limited use property" within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2001-28.
None of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries
constitutes indebtedness with respect to which any interest deductions may be
disallowed under Sections 163(i), 163(j), 163(l) or 279 of the Code or under
any other applicable Laws.

 



 

(n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been either a

(including any VAT credits), any income Tax basis or other Tax attributes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than representations being made
as to the knowledge of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, no
representation is being made as to whether any net operating losses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are subject to limitation under Sections
269, 382, 383, 384 or 1502 of the Code, or comparable provisions of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law.

assets in the hands of such transferring Person.

 



 

(s) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a party to
any Tax allocation, Tax sharing, indemnity or similar agreement or

Taxes payable by such Person (including any agreement by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to allocate Tax liabilities computed on a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis among entities, or agreed to
indemnify any other Person against Tax Liabilities). For the purposes of this
Section 3.10(s), commercially reasonable agreements providing for the

in the ordinary course of business ("Excluded Tax Sharing Agreements") shall
be disregarded.

Subsidiaries joined, or was or may be required to join, for any taxable period
in making a consolidated federal income Tax Return or other Tax Return in
which Tax Liability was or would be computed on a consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar basis, and (ii) has ever had a relationship to any other
Person (other than a relationship between the Company and its Subsidiaries)
that would cause it to be liable for Taxes owed by any other Person (other
than as a payor required to effect Tax withholding from payments to another
Person), including, without limitation, Tax payable by reason of transferee
liability, operation of Law or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision under
Law).

received and used aid granted by a Government Authority, in whatever form, in
the nature of Tax incentives or benefits that are not generally available to
all similarly situated taxpayers without specific application, such aid was
availed of only in accordance with applicable Laws and in compliance with all

proceeding threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case
which alleges that the Company or any Subsidiary has materially breached any
term of any nondisclosure agreement to which the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

any Subsidiary is a party. The Company and each Subsidiary have made available
to Parent copies of all nondisclosure agreements between the Company and each

interest in such Intellectual Property to the Company or a Subsidiary and
waiving their non-assignable rights (including moral rights) in such developed
Intellectual Property in favor of the Company or a Subsidiary and their
permitted assigns and licensees, and who have no residual claim to such
materials. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(i)_ , to the extent that any
Intellectual Property has been developed or created independently or jointly
by an independent contractor or other third party for the Company or a
Subsidiary, the Company or such Subsidiary has a written agreement with such

and is the exclusive owner of all such independent contractors or third

activities of the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary violates any

former employer.

 



 

(j) _Noncontravention_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(j)_ , the

the Company under, or create on behalf of any third party a right to terminate
or modify, any license or other agreement relating to Company Intellectual
Property; (ii) restrict the continued use by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company Intellectual Property to any greater or different extent than the
restrictions to which the Company or any Subsidiary is currently subject, or

Exploit, any Company Intellectual Property; (iii) cause the grant to any third
party of any new, additional or expanded right to receive or Exploit any
Company Owned Intellectual Property; (iv) cause the Company or any Subsidiary

in the operation or scope of its

 



      
 

 



 

business; or (v) cause the Company or any Subsidiary to be obligated to pay
any royalties or other material amounts, or offer any incremental discounts,
to any third party in excess of those currently payable by the Company or any

Effective Time.

 



 

(k) _Educational Institutions; Governmental Authorities_. No Company Owned

contractor, or escrow agent of the Company or any Subsidiary at the time of
disclosure, except pursuant to the agreements listed on _Schedule 3.17(l)_ ,
and the Company and each Subsidiary have taken all reasonable physical and
electronic security measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of such
Company Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition
exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would
reasonably be expected to, nor will the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, cause the disclosure or release of such
Company Source Code by the Company or any Subsidiary, escrow agent(s), or any
other Person to any third party.

neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (i) incorporated Open Source
Materials into, or combined Open Source Materials with, any Company Product;
(ii) used Open Source Materials in Company Products in a manner that creates
obligations for the Company or any Subsidiary, as a condition of Exploitation
of such Open Source Materials, to cause any Company Owned Intellectual
Property to be (x) disclosed, distributed or otherwise made available in
source code form, (y) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works or

standard as those imposed on the Stockholders Representative under this
Section 6.3.

 



 

6.4 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not (and the Company
shall cause the Companys Representatives not to) solicit or encourage the
initiation or submission of interest, offers, inquiries or proposals (or
consider or entertain any of the foregoing) from any Person (including,
without limitation, by way of providing any non-public information concerning
the Company, its business or assets to any Person or otherwise), initiate or
participate in any negotiations or discussions, or enter into, accept or
authorize any agreement or agreement in principle, or announce any intention
to do any of the foregoing, with respect to any expression of interest, offer,
proposal to acquire, purchase, license, or lease (i) all or a substantial
portion of the Companys business or assets (including, without limitation the
Company Intellectual Property), or (ii) the Companys capital stock or other
securities, in each case whether by stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, purchase of assets, tender
offer, lease, license or otherwise (any of the foregoing, a " _Competing
Transaction_ "). The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its
Representatives to, immediately discontinue any ongoing discussions or
negotiations (other than any ongoing discussions with Parent) relating to a
possible Competing Transaction, and shall promptly provide Parent with an oral
and a written notice of any expression of interest, proposal or offer relating
to a possible Competing Transaction that is received by the Company or by any
of the Companys Representatives from any person, which notice shall contain
the nature of the proposal proposed and the material terms of the proposal and
include copies of any such notice, inquiry or proposal.

 



 

(b) Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify the Recommendation;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the receipt of the Requisite Vote the
board of directors of the Company may withdraw, amend or modify the
Recommendation, and may make any statement required by applicable laws, if (x)
the Company receives an unsolicited, written proposal for a Competing
Transaction that the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside
legal counsel and its independent financial advisors, is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal that is reasonably likely to be consummated by
the Company, (y) the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, upon written advice of outside legal counsel, that a change in the
Recommendation is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
the DGCL, and (z) the Company shall have complied with the notice requirement
set forth in Section 6.4(a) and provided Parent with no less than five (5)
business days notice of any contemplated withdrawal, amendment or
modification to the Recommendation, during which time the Company and Parent
shall negotiate in good faith regarding any changes to the terms of the
Transaction contemplated hereby that may be proposed by Parent such that the
Competing Transaction would no longer be reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" shall
mean any bona fide proposal for a Competing Transaction that is on terms that
the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, upon
written advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal, including the financing terms thereof is superior from a financial
point of view to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of
the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect at or prior to the Closing such that
any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 or Article 8, as applicable,
hereof would not be satisfied; and (b) any failure of such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by such hereunder, in each case such that any of the conditions set
forth in Article 7 or Article 8, as applicable, hereof would not be satisfied.

 



 

6.6 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns after Closing_.

 



 

(i) Parent shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) with the
appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date that become due after the Closing Date (each
a " _Parent Required Prepared Return_ "), and any Tax Returns required to have
been filed by the Company that have not been filed on or before the Closing
Date (each a " _Parent Permitted Return_ " and with Parent Required Prepared
Returns, " _Parent Prepared Returns_ "). Each Parent Prepared Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law or consented to
by the Stockholders Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably
delayed or withheld).

 



 

(ii) If the Tax shown as due on any Parent Prepared Return would be subject to
indemnification by the Participating Holders pursuant to Section 9.1, Parent
shall provide the Stockholders Representative with a copy of such Parent
Prepared Return for review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the
filing of such Tax Return (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days
after the Closing or the end of the taxable period to which such return
relates, as soon as reasonably possible following the Closing or the end of
such taxable period, as the case may be), accompanied (if relevant) by a
statement setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Taxes that
are shown as due on such Tax Return and claimed to be indemnifiable pursuant
to Section 9.1. Parent shall cause such Tax

 



       
 

 



 

Return to be revised as reasonably requested in writing by the Stockholders
Representative at least five (5) days prior to the required filing date of
such Tax Return. For purposes of the foregoing, a revision to a Parent
Prepared Return shall not be considered to have been reasonably requested if
(w) there is not substantial authority for the requested change in reporting
within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, (x) a reserve for Tax
liability would be required to be established in the financial statements of
Parent or the Company for potential Tax liability that is not shown as due on
such Tax Return or (y) Parent reasonably determines that the position is not
more likely than not to be sustained and either the Damages that foreseeably
could result from the failure to sustain the requested Tax reporting position
would not be indemnifiable to Parent under this Agreement or there is not
adequate security for the potential indemnification obligations of the
Participating Holders under Section 9.1 for such Damages.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall, subject to any indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1,
pay or cause to be paid the Tax shown as due on each Parent Prepared Return.

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Taxes_. The Stockholders, Parent and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, cause the
taxable period of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to end as of the
close of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes incurred by
the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to a taxable period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date, shall be allocated to the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date as follows: (i) except as provided in (ii)
and (iii) below, to the extent feasible, on a specific identification basis,
according to the date of the event or transaction giving rise to the Tax, (ii)
except as provided in (iii) below, with respect to periodically assessed ad
valorem Taxes and Taxes not otherwise feasibly allocable to specific
transactions or events, in proportion to the number of days in such period
occurring through and including the Closing Date compared to the total number
of days in such taxable period, and (iii) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income or receipts, in an amount equal to the Tax which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. It is
acknowledged for avoidance of doubt that the Participating Holders shall have
no indemnity obligation under Section 9.1(a) with respect to any Specified
Taxes without regard to whether such Taxes would be allocable to a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date under the above principles. Any
Tax credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period
ended on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Tax Proceedings_. Any Party who receives any notice of a pending or
threatened Tax audit, assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries that may give rise to Liability of another Party
hereto or the Participating Holders (including pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement), shall promptly notify such other Party within
ten (10) business days of the receipt of such notice. The Parties each agree
to consult with and to keep the other Parties hereto informed on a regular
basis regarding the status of any Tax Proceeding to the extent that such
Proceeding could affect a Liability which could reasonably be a basis for a
claim pursuant to the indemnity obligations hereunder. Parent will have the
right to control the conduct of and the resolution of any Proceeding which
could reasonably be a basis for a claim pursuant to the indemnity obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) the Stockholders Representative shall
have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense of any such
Proceeding and to employ counsel, at the expense of the Participating Holders,
separate from the counsel employed by Parent, and (ii) Parent may not settle
any such Proceeding in any manner which would adversely affect the
Participating Holders without the written consent of the Stockholders
Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(d) _Cooperation, Access to Information, and Record Retention_. The
Stockholders, Parent and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate, and
shall cause their representatives to cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party hereto in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

preparation and filing of Tax Returns as provided herein, any Proceeding with
respect to Taxes, and any determination regarding reflection of Tax
liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries in financial statements of
Parent. Such cooperation shall include the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, Proceeding
relating to Taxes or any preparation of financial statements, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Stockholders, Parent and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including Tax Returns) relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment
of Taxes for such respective taxable period and (ii) give the other Parties
hereto reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if another Party so requests, allow
the other Party to either copy or take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(e) _Tax Certificates_. The Parties further agree, upon request, to use
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Government Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
other Person (other than any such agreement created by the execution of this
Agreement and any Excluded Tax Sharing Agreements) shall be terminated on or
before the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

 



 

(g) _Transfer Taxes and Tax Indemnity_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, all Korea
Transfer Taxes incurred by any Stockholder in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by such Stockholder when due.
Such Stockholder shall, at such Stockholders expense, prepare and file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes. If required by applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 



 

(ii) All Transfer Taxes (other than Korea Transfer Taxes) imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Affiliates in connection with
consummation of the Merger shall be borne 50% by the Participating Holders
(directly by indemnification, or by inclusion of such, as a Tax liability of
the Company attributable to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date, in Closing Liabilities), and 50% by Parent.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall indemnify each Participating Holder for any increase in Tax
imposed on such Participating Holder by reason of the consummation of the
Merger which increase is attributable to direct or indirect ownership of
capital stock of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time by a person that is not
a U.S. person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

 



 

6.7 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party actively
is contesting or defending against any charge, complaint, action, suit, audit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim, or demand in connection with (i)
any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving the Company, each of the other Parties will cooperate with such
Party or its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel,
and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be
necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and
expense of the contesting or defending

 



      
 

 



 

Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Article IX below).

 



 

6.8 _Reasonable Efforts_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each Party agrees to
use all reasonable efforts promptly to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to (a) obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, make all
filings with and give all notices to Government Authorities or any other
Person required to consummate the Merger and the other matters contemplated
hereby, (b) provide such other information and communications to such
Government Authorities or other public or private Persons as the other Party
or such Government Authorities or other public or private Persons may
reasonably request in connection therewith, and (c) execute such further
documents, deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and take such
further actions as may reasonably be required to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including, without limitation,
the satisfaction of all conditions hereto. If applicable, the Parties shall
file all notices and other information and documents required under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof.

 



 

6.9 _Company Employees_. The Company agrees that during the Pre-Closing
Period it shall make all reasonable efforts to maintain good relations with
its employees and will honor all previous agreements with employees to be
performed prior to Closing. The Company agrees that promptly after the date
hereof it shall allow Parent to make a presentation to the Companys and each
of its Subsidiaries employees and to interview such employees for continued
employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, after the
Closing. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will use all reasonable
efforts to cause such Company Employees to make available their employment
services to the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the board of directors of the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the Merger and such other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any Takeover
Statute on the Merger and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

6.11 _Employee Benefits Matters_. Effective immediately preceding the Closing,
the Company will terminate any and all Company Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and,
at the request of Parent, the Company will provide Parent with evidence that
such plans have been terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing
pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors of the Company
or other duly-designated authority. In addition, at the request of Parent no
later than five (5) days prior to the Closing, the Company will terminate any
one or more Welfare Plans, including any group health, dental, severance,
separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements, effective
as of the date specified by Parent and, at the request of Parent, the Company
will provide Parent with evidence that such Welfare Plans have been so
terminated pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors of
the Company or other duly-designated authority. The Company also shall take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Plans as Parent
may reasonably require. Prior to the Closing, each of the officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates of the Company shall repay in full, in accordance
with their terms, all debts and other obligations, if any, owed to the
Company.

(a) Subject to Section 6.4(b), the Company, through its board of directors,
shall unanimously recommend to the Stockholders that the Stockholders approve

each Company Stockholder that did not execute a Written Consent (the "
_Nonconsenting Stockholders_ ") of the action by Written Consent of the

_Information Statement_ ") containing substantially the same information as is

the information supplied by such Party for inclusion in the Consent
Solicitation Statement and the Information Statement will not, on the date the
Consent Solicitation Statement and the Information Statement is first sent or
furnished to the Company Stockholders or at any time Written Consents are
being solicited, contain any statement which, at such time, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.

 



 

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the Significant Stockholders agrees
not to, and each Significant Stockholder agrees not to permit any Person to,

of Company with respect to any of the following, each of the Significant
Stockholders shall vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent, if
applicable), all Shares held or controlled by each of them (a) in favor of (i)
approval of the Merger and this Agreement and (ii) any other transactions
contemplated hereby or other matters that could reasonably be expected to
facilitate the Merger, and (b) against the adoption of any Competing
Transaction. Each Significant Stockholder hereby waives any rights of
appraisal or rights of dissent to be exercised with respect to the Shares held
by each of them.

 



 

(e) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall submit to the Companys
stockholders for approval (in a manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number
of stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments or benefits that may, separately or in
the aggregate, exceed 299% of such recipients "base amount" (as that term is
defined in Section 280G of the Code) (which determination shall be made by
Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Parent), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be constitute "parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, and prior to the Effective
Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that
(i) a vote of the stockholders of the Company was solicited in conformance
with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

6.13 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided immediately following
the Effective Time, to all employees of the Company whose employment continues
with Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any applicable Subsidiary of
Parent or Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "): (i) an annual base salary or hourly wage rate that
is no less favorable than the annual base salary or hourly wage rate in effect
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits that
are provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent under a Parent Plan.

 



 

(b) To the extent that Continuing Employees are transitioned to the employee
welfare and retirement benefit plans of Parent or its subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (each a " _Parent Plan_ ") and to the extent permitted by Law,
applicable Tax qualification requirements and the provisions of the applicable
Parent Plan, and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule,
(i) each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company or its Subsidiary (or any predecessor entities)
before the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
and determination of level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any Parent Plans or to the extent that such recognition would
result in duplication of benefits), but only to the extent such service would
have been taken into account under a Parent Plan had such service been
performed as an employee of Parent and _provided that_ , if the Company
maintained a comparable plan prior to the Effective Time, such service will
only be credited to the extent such service was credited under such Company
Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its third-party insurance
providers or third-party administrators to ensure that such Continuing
Employees will receive credit under such medical plans for the shorter of (i)
the plan year in which the Closing occurs and (ii) the period commencing on
such Continuing Employees date of hire towards applicable deductibles and
out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs under the corresponding Company Plans.

 



 

(c) No provision of this Agreement is intended to provide or create any third
party beneficiary rights in any stockholder, Key Employee, consultant,
contractor or any other

 



      
 

 



 

Person, including any rights of employment for any specified period and/or any
employee benefits, other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. In addition, no provision of this Agreement
is intended, or shall be interpreted, to amend any term or condition of any
employee related plan, program or policy of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent
or to prohibit the amendment of any such plan, program or policy.

 



 

6.14 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries organizational documents in
effect as of the date of this Agreement providing for the indemnification and
exculpation from liability of its officers or directors and former officers
and directors with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred before or at the Effective Time (the Persons entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to such provisions, and all other current and former
officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and all
other Persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such provisions or
agreements being referred to collectively as the " _Pre-Closing Indemnified
Parties_ ").

 



 

(b) For the period from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of
the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, solely with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before or at the
Effective Time, cause to be maintained in effect, for the benefit of the Pre-
Closing Indemnified Parties (the " _Insured Parties_ "), the current
directors and officers liability insurance coverage as set forth in the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement or provide for coverage and amounts on
terms and conditions which are, in aggregate, no less advantageous to the
Insured Parties; provided, however, that: (i) in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required pursuant to this Section 6.14 (b) to expend
in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently
payable by the Company with respect to such current policy, it being
understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount; and (ii) in lieu
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in clause "(i)"
above, the Company may obtain a prepaid tail policy prior to the Effective
Time that provides the Insured Parties with directors and officers liability
insurance for a period ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of the successors or assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.14. This Section 6.14: (A) shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time; (B) is intended
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Insured Party and his or
her heirs and representatives; (C) shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation; and (D) provides rights that
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any Insured Party, or any heir or
representative of any Insured Party, may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

6.15 _Books and Records_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent the original share records of the Company, books of account, minute
books, minutes and other records of all meetings of the Company, the corporate
seal of the Company and such other documents, records, keys and other items as
shall be necessary for the operation of the business of the Company;

or its Subsidiaries by reason of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or a
predecessor of such entities) having been a member of an affiliated,

Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any

agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless each of the Indemnified
Parties from and against all Damages suffered, sustained, incurred or paid by
any Indemnified Party, in each case in connection with, resulting from or
arising out of, directly or indirectly: (i) the Breach of any representation
or warranty made by such Significant Stockholder set forth in this Agreement;
or (ii) the Breach on the part of such Significant Stockholder of any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

9.2 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim against any Person
from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") pursuant to
Section 9.1 hereof, which does not involve a claim being sought to be
collected by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice
of such claim (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholders Representative (or
the particular Indemnifying Party in the event that recovery is being sought
directly from such Indemnifying Party).

 



       
 

 



 

The Claim Notice shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an
estimate of the maximum amount of claimed Damages (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Damages) and a reasonable description
of the basis for such claim. If the Stockholders Representative (or the
Indemnifying Party, if applicable) does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days from receipt of the Claim Notice that Stockholders
Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, if applicable) disputes such claim,
or its (or the Indemnifying Parties) liability to the Indemnified Party for
such claim, the amount of such claim as set forth in the Claim Notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Parties hereunder. In case
an objection is made in writing by the Stockholders Representative (or the
Indemnifying Party, if applicable) in accordance with this Section 9.2(a) (an
" _Objection Notice_ "), the Indemnified Party shall have thirty (30) days to
respond in a written statement to such Objection Notice.

 



 

(b) In case the Stockholders Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, if
applicable) delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section 9.2(a)
hereof, the Stockholders Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, if
applicable) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of
the respective Parties with respect to each of such claims. If the dispute has
not been resolved within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party is given
an Objection Notice, either the Stockholders Representative (or the
Indemnifying Party, if applicable) or the Parent may initiate litigation in
accordance with this Agreement. In the event the Parent does not receive a
timely Objection Notice, the claim(s) set forth in the Claim Notice shall be
conclusively deemed to be approved by the Stockholders Representative (or the
Indemnifying Party, if applicable) and the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(c) Until the final resolution of any Claim Notice in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, an Indemnified Party, may from time to
time, amend such Claim Notice to reflect additional Damages thereunder.

 



 

9.3 _Third Party Claims_. In the event of the assertion or commencement by any
Person of any claim, demand or Proceeding (whether against Parent or against
any other Person) with respect to which any Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, Parent shall have the right,
at its election, to proceed with the defense (including settlement or
compromise) of such claim, demand or Proceeding on its own; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that Parent may not settle such claim without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Representative (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld). Parent shall give the Stockholders Representative
prompt notice after it becomes aware of the commencement of any such claim or
legal proceeding against Parent; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , any failure on the
part of Parent to so notify the Stockholders Representative shall not limit
any of the obligations of the Participating Holders or the Stockholders
Representative, or any of the rights of any Indemnified Party, under this
Article IX (except to the extent such failure materially adversely prejudices
the defense of such Proceeding). If Parent does not elect to proceed with the
defense (including settlement or compromise) of any such claim, demand or
Proceeding, the Stockholders Representative may proceed with the defense of
such claim, demand or Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Parent; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the Stockholders Representative may
not settle or compromise any such claim, demand or Proceeding without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld). No Indemnified Party (other than Parent or any successor thereto or
assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or
exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor
thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

 



 

9.4 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Each covenant and
agreement contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or other document
delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing and be enforceable until
such covenant or agreement has been fully performed. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or other document

 



      
 

 



 

delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing until the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and shall thereafter expire, except
that any representation or warranty with respect to which a claim has been
made for a Breach thereon prior to such date shall survive until such claim is
resolved; _provided,_ _that_ , the foregoing limitations on survival shall not
apply to (i) claims based on criminal matters, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation (" _Fraud Claims_ "), which shall survive without limitation
(and in no event less than six years) or (ii) claims based on Breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in (x) Sections 3.2 (Authority), 3.4
(Capitalization), 3.8 (Company Plans), 3.10 (Taxes) and 3.15 (Environmental
and Safety Matters) (the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), and claims based
on Section 9.1(a)(iv) (Taxes), which shall survive the Closing until the date
on which the underlying statute of limitations expires (or if there is no
applicable statute of limitations relating thereto, such representation and
warranty shall survive indefinitely) (collectively, the claims described in
this clause (ii), the " _Excluded Claims_ "). Any Indemnified Party may bring
a claim hereunder for potential or contingent Damages notwithstanding the fact
that the full amount of such potential or contingent Damages is not readily
determinable.

 



 

9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to Excluded Claims and subject to Section 9.5(d), the
indemnification obligations of the Participating Holders for Damages for the
matters specified in Section 9.1(a)(i) shall be limited to an amount equal to
the Escrow Amount (the " _General Cap_ "). Claims for Damages under this
Agreement (other than pursuant to Sections 9.1(b) and 9.5(d)) shall be: (i)
first against the Escrow Amount; and (ii) second, after such time as all
Initial Escrow Amount deposited into the Escrow Amount have been exhausted,
are subject to preexisting indemnification claims or have otherwise been
distributed to the Participating Holders, and only prior to the deposit of the
Additional Escrowed Funds, by set off against ten percent (10%) of any unpaid
Initial Order Cash Consideration or unpaid Performance Payment. Parent shall
seek payment for Damages indemnifiable pursuant to Sections 9.1(b) and 9.5(d)
directly from the applicable Significant Stockholder.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to Section 9.5(d): (i) no Participating Holder shall be liable for an
amount in excess of such Participants Pro Rata Proportion of the Damages in
respect of such matter; and (ii) no Participating Holder shall have an
indemnification obligation under this Agreement in excess of the aggregate
amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by such Participating
Holder pursuant to this Agreement or the Phantom Equity Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 9.5(d), Parent shall not be permitted to recover any
Damages under this Article IX until such Damages exceed, in the aggregate,
$500,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), _provided_ , _that_ , after the
aggregate amount of Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, only those Damages
above the Threshold Amount shall be recoverable by Parent.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limitations set forth in Section 9.5 shall not be applicable to claims against
a Participating Holder based upon fraud committed by such Participating
Holder, and the limitations set forth in Section 9.5(c) shall not be
applicable to claims based on Section 9.1(a)(iv) (Taxes).

 



 

9.6 _No Contribution_. Each Stockholder waives, and acknowledges and agrees
that he shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
similar right or remedy against the Company, Parent, the Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, in connection with any actual or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty or obligation set forth in this
Agreement or any claim for Damages under Section 9.1.

 



      
 

 



 

9.7 _Right of Offset_. In the event that any Participating Holder shall have
an indemnification obligation for Damages to Parent or any other Indemnified
Party, Parent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to offset the
amount of the Damages against any portion of the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to such Participating Holder
(including without limitation the Escrow Amount and the unpaid Initial Order
Cash Consideration and unpaid Performance Payment). Such remedy shall be in
addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other rights or
remedies to which the Parent or any other Indemnified Party is or may be
entitled at law or equity or in any administrative or other proceeding or
under this Agreement (including any exhibits hereto).

 



 

9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provisions contained in this
ARTICLE IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of an Indemnified Party
attributable to claims under, relating to or arising out of the Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and the sole and exclusive source of
satisfying obligations of the Participating Holders under this Agreement,
other than Fraud Claims.

 



 

9.9 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Party shall be entitled to reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement
for any amount to the extent such Party has previously been reimbursed for
such amount under any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

9.10 _Third Party Recovery_. The amount of Damages otherwise recoverable under
this Article IX shall be limited to the amount of any Damage that remains
after deducting therefrom (i) any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar cash payment recovered by the Indemnified
Parties from any third party with respect thereto and (ii) any Tax benefits
actually realized by Parent or any of its Affiliates in the taxable year that
the Damage is incurred or in any of the following two (2) taxable years.

 



 

9.11 _Waiver of Damages_. Parent, on behalf of itself and the other
Indemnified Parties, waives any claim to punitive, incidental, indirect,
special, consequential or exemplary Damages (except to the extent payable in
respect of third party claims).

the manner hereinafter provided, be terminated and abandoned at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) by mutual agreement of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(ii) by the Company if there has been a Breach by Parent with respect to its
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, in each case such
that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof would not be
satisfied, and such misrepresentation, default or breach shall not have been
cured within ten (10) days after receipt by Parent of notice specifying
particularly such misrepresentation, default or breach;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) by Parent if there has been a Breach by the Company or the Significant
Stockholders with respect to any of their respective representations,
warranties or covenants in this Agreement, in each case such that the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 hereof would not be satisfied, and
such misrepresentation, default or breach shall not have been cured within ten
(10) days after receipt by the Company of notice specifying particularly such
misrepresentation, default or breach;

 



 

(iv) by the Company or by Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before 60 days after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement if its breach or violation of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained herein shall have been the principal cause of the Closing
not having occurred on or before such date;

 



 

(v) by Parent if Written Consents evidencing the Requisite Vote shall not have
been delivered, properly completed and executed to approve the Merger, this
Agreement and the documents and transactions contemplated hereby within eight
(8) business days after the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(vi) by the Company or by Parent, if (i) there shall be a final nonappealable
order of a federal or state court in effect preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) there shall be any action
taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or
issued or deemed applicable to the transactions by any Government Authority
which would make the consummation of the transactions illegal; or

 



 

(vii) by Parent if, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Vote, it
shall have determined there has occurred an effect, event or change which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1
(a), this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, except
that nothing herein will relieve any Party from Liability for any willful
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

11.2 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable, documented, out-of-
pocket costs incurred after August 1, 2013 in connection with the negotiation
and anticipated consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in an amount not to exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) (the " _Expense Payment_ ") in the event that this Agreement is
terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(ii) or Section
11.1(a)(iv) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(iv) in the event
that, at the time of such termination, all conditions to Closing have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing). Parent shall pay the Expense Payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) business days of the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Expense Payment becomes payable and if requested by
the Company, Parent will provide interim financing to the Company in an amount
not to exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Interim Financing_ ").
The Interim Financing may be provided by Parent in the form of a loan or an
investment in the equity of the Company upon customary terms to be mutually
agreed between the Company and Parent; provided that any debt financing shall
include the following terms: (i) interest rate equal to LIBOR, (ii) 12 month
term, (iii) subordinate to existing senior debt of the Company, (iv) unsecured
and with no negative pledges on intellectual property or other assets of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, (v) the absence of financial or other operating covenants, and (vi)
the absence of warrant or other equity security coverage.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, payment of the
Expense Payment and, if requested, Interim Financing to the Company by Parent
in accordance with this Agreement will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Stockholders under this Agreement and will be deemed
liquidated damages for any actual or purported breach of this Agreement and
the other agreements contemplated hereby, and, after such payment has been
made, Parent will have no further liability for any such actual or purported
breach and the Company shall not seek to recover any other money damages or
seek any other remedy, and all such claims are hereby waived, except that
nothing herein will relieve any Indemnified Party from Liability for any
willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement. The Parties agree that the Companys actual damages
would be extremely difficult or impracticable to determine in the event of
termination pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 11.2(a)(i) and
(ii). The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
this Section 11.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that without these agreements Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement and that the amounts payable hereunder do not
constitute a penalty.

 



 

(d) In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Expense Payment or Interim
Financing on more than one occasion, whether or not the Expense Payment or
Interim Financing may be payable under more than one provision of this
Agreement, at the same or at different times.

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not make any assignment of this
Agreement or any interest herein without the prior written consent of Parent
and Parent may not make any assignment of this Agreement or any interest

of this Agreement or any agreement entered into in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party agrees
to commence any such action, suit or proceeding either in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or if such suit, action or other
proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the
state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware. Each party further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such partys respective address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 12.3. Each
party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any

not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter

Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 12.4.

 



 

12.5 _Specific Performance_. The Company acknowledges that Parent shall be
irreparably harmed and that there shall be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by Company of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. Parent acknowledges that the Participating Holders shall be
irreparably harmed and that there shall be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to, but not in lieu of, any other

agreements, Parent and the Company, if prior to the Closing, or the
Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders), if
after the Closing, shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief to
restrain a breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise to obtain specific
performance of, any of the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement. All rights and remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative,
