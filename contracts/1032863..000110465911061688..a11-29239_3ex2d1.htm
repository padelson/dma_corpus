 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 7, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among General Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Falcon Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and
a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Force Protection,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

A. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and the
respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have determined that
it is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to
enter into the transactions provided for herein, and have approved the
acquisition by Parent of the Company through the consummation of the Offer (as
defined below), the Top-Up Option (as defined below), the Merger (as defined
below) and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

B. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (as amended or
supplemented in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase
for cash all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Shares_ ") that are issued and outstanding at a price
per Company Share of $5.52 in cash, without interest (such price, or such
other price per Company Share as may be paid in the Offer in accordance with
the terms hereof, the " _Offer Price_");

 



 

C. Regardless of whether the Acceptance Time (as defined below) occurs, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as
expressly provided in Section 4.1, each issued and outstanding Company Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined below) of the Merger will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the
Offer Price; and

 



 

D. The Company Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub have adopted,
and the board of directors of Parent has approved and declared the
advisability of, this Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and the Company Board
and the board of directors of Merger Sub have recommended this Agreement to
their respective stockholders.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

       
 

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER**

 



 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and so long as none of the
events or circumstances set forth in subsections (c)(i) through (c)(iv) of
_Annex A_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub as promptly as practicable (and in any event on or before the close
of business on November 18, 2011) to commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer at the Offer Price. The obligations of
Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and to
pay for Company Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not
withdrawn prior to the applicable Expiration Date shall be subject solely to
those conditions set forth in _Annex A_. The conditions to the Offer set
forth on _Annex A_ are only for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may
be asserted or waived only by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, in
their sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written
consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not waive the Minimum
Condition or the HSR Condition. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in
its sole discretion, to modify the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of the
Company, no modification or change may be made that (i) decreases the Offer
Price (except as permitted by this Agreement), (ii) changes the form of
consideration payable in the Offer (other than by adding cash consideration),
(iii) changes the Minimum Condition, (iv) reduces or limits the number of
Company Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (v) changes the conditions set
forth in _Annex A_ hereto in a manner adverse to the holders of any of the
Company Shares, (vi) adds any additional conditions to the Offer that are not
set forth in _Annex A_ , (vii) extends the Offer except as provided in Section
1.1(b) or (viii) otherwise amends, modifies or changes the Offer in a manner
that is adverse to the holders of any of the Company Shares.

 



 

(b) The expiration date and time of the Offer shall be midnight, New York City
time, on the twentieth (20th) business day following the commencement of the
Offer (as determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, such later date and time to which
the Offer has been extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date
and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), (i) if at
the then-scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions set forth in _Annex
A_ shall not be satisfied (and, if permitted to be waived by Parent and Merger
Sub by Section 1.1(a), not waived by Parent and Merger Sub), extend and re-
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for one or more additional periods
of up to five (5) Business Days each (the length of each such increment to be
determined by Merger Sub) and (ii) extend and re-extend the Offer for any
period required by any Law or by any interpretation or position of the SEC or
the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , that (i) if the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date has occurred on or prior to January 5, 2012, then no
such extension shall be required after January 5, 2012 and (ii) if the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date has not occurred on or prior to January 5, 2012 (and
any of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ shall not be satisfied (and, if
permitted to be waived by Parent and Merger Sub by Section 1.1(a), not waived
by Parent and Merger Sub)), then either Parent or the Company may request, and
upon such request, Merger Sub shall extend

 



      
 

 



 

and re-extend the Offer on as many occasions as requested for one or more
additional periods of up to five (5) Business Days each (the length of each
such increment to be determined by Merger Sub) until the Proxy Statement
Clearance Date. " _Proxy Statement Clearance Date_ " means the date on which
the SEC has, orally or in writing, confirmed that it has no further comments
on the Proxy Statement, including the first date following the tenth (10th)
calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement if the
SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger
Sub to) extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Furthermore, (i) Merger Sub
may in its sole discretion elect to provide for a "subsequent offering period"
pursuant to, and in accordance with, Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (a "
_Subsequent Offering Period_ ") of no greater than three (3) business days (as
determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) and (ii) Merger Sub
may in its discretion elect to extend such Subsequent Offering Period for one
additional period of no greater than five (5) business days (as determined
using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) in the event that, upon
expiration of a Subsequent Offering Period provided pursuant to clause (i),
the total number of Company Shares validly tendered (x) in the Offer and not
validly withdrawn (excluding any Company Shares that are subject to the
guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in the Offer Documents and that have
not been actually delivered to Merger Sub under those delivery guarantees) and
(y) during any Subsequent Offering Period is together less than the total
number of Company Shares that would have been required to be tendered into the
Offer to satisfy the Minimum Condition if no Company Shares were tendered into
the Offer pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in the
Offer Documents.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
and the satisfaction (and, if permitted to be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
by Section 1.1(a), not waived by Parent and Merger Sub) of the conditions set
forth in _Annex A_ , (i) as soon as practicable after the applicable
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall accept for payment and promptly (and in any
event within three (3) business days (as determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) after such acceptance) pay for, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for, all Company Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance
for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ ", and such acceptance for payment, the "
_Offer Closing_ "), or (ii) in the case of any Company Shares tendered during
any Subsequent Offering Period, Merger Sub shall immediately accept for
payment and promptly (and in any event within three (3) business days (as
determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay for, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for, all such Company
Shares validly tendered during such period.

 



 

(d) If at any then-scheduled Expiration Date occurring after ** __** January
5, 2012 (i) any of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ shall not have been
satisfied (and, if permitted to be waived by Parent and Merger Sub by Section
1.1(a), not waived by Parent and Merger Sub) and (ii) the Proxy Statement
Clearance Date shall have occurred (such Expiration Date, the  _Offer
Determination Date_ "), then Merger Sub may irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. In addition, the Company shall have the right,
exercisable by delivering written notice to Parent and Merger Sub at any time
from and after the Offer Determination Date, to request in writing Merger Sub
to, and upon receipt of such written request, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer
at the then-scheduled

 



      
 

 



 

Expiration Date following the receipt of such written request from the Company
(delivered no less than one (1) Business Day prior to the then-scheduled
Expiration Date). The termination of the Offer pursuant to this Section 1.1(d)
is referred to herein as the " _Offer Termination_ ," and the date on which
the Offer Termination occurs is referred to herein as the " _Offer Termination
Date_." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.1(d), if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, then Merger Sub shall
promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day after such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, Merger Sub shall promptly return,
and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all
tendered Company Shares to the registered holders thereof to the extent
required by the terms of the Offer. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Offer Termination shall not give rise to a right of termination of
this Agreement unless to the extent expressly provided for in Section 9.1 and
that, absent such termination of this Agreement, the obligations of the
parties hereunder other than those related to the Offer shall continue to
remain in effect, including those obligations with respect to the Merger.

 



 

(e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC with respect to the Offer a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") which shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase relating to the Offer and form
of the related letter of transmittal (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto and including the exhibits thereto, are
referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company
shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or
reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub in writing for inclusion
therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of the Company Shares as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_ "). Parent shall deliver
copies of the proposed forms of the Offer Documents to the Company and its
counsel in advance of filing with the SEC and the commencement of the Offer
and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for review and comment by the
Company and its counsel. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any amendments and supplements to the initial
Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC or dissemination to the
holders of the Company Shares. Parent shall provide the Company and its
counsel any written comments (and summaries of all material oral comments)
that Merger Sub, Parent or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of any such
comments, and provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the preparation of responses to any such SEC comments. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated
to the holders of the Company Shares, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable Securities Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Parent has and Merger Sub will have available to it all funds necessary to
permit Merger Sub to satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement,
including acquiring all of the outstanding Company Shares in the Offer and the
Merger by no later than the Expiration Date.

 



 

1.2 _Company Action_ _._

 



 

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and the inclusion in
the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation.

 



 

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the
filing by Parent of the Offer Documents, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") which,
subject to Section 7.5(d), (e) and (f), shall contain a description of the
Company Board Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the
holders of the Company Shares (concurrently with and in the same mailing
envelope as the Offer Documents) as and to the extent required by applicable
Securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the
Schedule 14D-9 to Parent and its counsel in advance of the filing with the SEC
and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for review and comment by Parent
and its counsel. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendments and supplements to the
Schedule 14D-9 prior to their filing with the SEC or dissemination to the
holders of the Company Shares. The Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel any written comments (and summaries of all material oral comments)
that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of any such comments, and
provide the Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the preparation of responses to any such SEC comments. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect and the Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause such Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the holders of the Company Shares, in each case, as
and to the extent required by applicable Securities Laws.

 



 

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent or agents to furnish
Merger Sub, promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as
requested by Parent, Merger Sub or their agents, with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Company Shares
as of a recent date and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to
such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files and all other information in the
Companys possession or control, to the extent reasonably available to the
Company, regarding the beneficial owners of the Company Shares, and shall
furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists
of holders of the Company Shares, security position listings and computer
files) as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the holders of the Company Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall not use or
disclose the information contained in any such labels, listings and files
other than in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance
with Section 9.1, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the
Company all copies of such information then in their possession or control.

 



 

(d) During the five (5) Business Days before the then-scheduled Expiration
Date and on the first (1st) Business Day following the Expiration Date,
promptly following the written request of Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
shall certify to Parent and Merger Sub in writing as to (i) the number of
Company Shares then outstanding (including Company Shares that are Company
Performance-Based Restricted Shares or Company Time Vested Restricted Shares),
(ii) the number of Company Performance-Based Restricted Shares then
outstanding, (iii) the number of Company Time Vested Restricted Shares then
outstanding, (iv) the number of Company Shares issuable in respect of Company
Stock Options then outstanding, (v) the number of Company Shares issuable in
respect of Company Performance-Based Restricted Share Rights then outstanding,
(vi) the Companys computation of the number of Fully Diluted Company Shares
then outstanding, with supporting detail, (vii) the number of Company Shares
authorized and available for issuance and sale by the Company to Merger Sub in
connection with an exercise of the Top-Up Option and (viii) any other
information in the possession of the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub in order to enable Parent and Merger Sub to determine
whether or not the Minimum Condition has been or would be satisfied.

 



 

1.3 _Directors; Section 14(f)_.

 



 

(a) Effective upon Merger Subs purchase of the Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall, subject to the
qualifications for directors set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and
the terms of this Agreement, **** be entitled to designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, for election or appointment to
the Company Board as will give Parent representation on the Company Board
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(after giving effect to the increase in the size of the Company Board pursuant
to this Section 1.3) and (ii) a fraction equal to the aggregate number of
Company Shares beneficially owned by Merger Sub and Parent (including Company
Shares so accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer) divided by the total
aggregate number of all Company Shares then outstanding. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _beneficial ownership_ " (and its correlative terms)
shall have the meaning assigned to it in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. In
furtherance thereof, upon request of Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such designees of Parent and Merger Sub to be
so elected or appointed at such time, including (at the election of Parent) by
increasing the size of the Company Board to the extent permitted by the
Articles of Incorporation and/or by obtaining resignations of incumbent
directors. At such time, the Company shall take all necessary action to cause
Persons designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (A) each
committee of the Company Board and (B) each board of directors (or similar
governing body) of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee
thereof), in each case to the greatest extent permitted by Securities Laws,
the listing requirements of the Nasdaq and any other applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board pursuant to this Section 1.3 shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule

 



      
 

 



 

14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors and Parents designees, as Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.3. Parent shall provide to the Company, and be solely
responsible for, on a timely basis, the information with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The provisions of
this Section 1.3 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that
Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub may have (with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a
holder or beneficial owner of the Company Shares.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that, if Parents designees are elected or
appointed to the Company Board, the Company Board shall have, at all times
prior to the Effective Time, at least two (2) directors who are directors on
the date of this Agreement and who are not officers, employees or affiliates
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that for purposes of this sentence, a director of the Company or
Parent shall not be deemed an affiliate of the Company solely as a result of
his or her status as a director of the Company or Parent) and who are
"independent directors" as defined by Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2) and eligible to
serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq
rules, and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert"
as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto
(the " _Independent Directors_ "), (ii) if the number of Independent Directors
shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever, the remaining
Independent Director may designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is not an
officer, employee or affiliate of the Company, Parent, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and who otherwise meets the other criteria to be
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement and (iii)
if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors may designate two
(2) Persons to fill such vacancies who shall not be officers, employees or
affiliates of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and
who otherwise meet the other criteria to be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the
period after election or appointment of directors designated by Parent
pursuant to this Section 1.3 but prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall delegate to a committee of the Company Board comprised solely of
the Independent Directors (the " _Independent Committee_ ") the sole
responsibility for (i) any amendment or any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any of the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement for which the
Companys consent or approval is required, (iii) the exercise or waiver of any
of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (iv) any determinations or
agreements made by or on behalf of the Company under this Agreement, (v) any
waiver of compliance with any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub or any
condition to any obligation of the Company or of any of the Companys rights
under this Agreement and (vi) any other matter in connection with the Merger
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the receipt of the
Merger Consideration by holders of Company Shares (other than Parent and
Merger Sub), including the timing of such receipt. Any action of the
Independent Committee with respect to the above matters in the preceding
sentence shall be deemed to constitute the action of the full Company Board to
approve the actions contemplated hereby and no other

 



      
 

 



 

action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director
or officers of the Company, shall be required for such authorization. The
Independent Committee shall have the authority to retain one (1) separate
counsel at the reasonable expense of the Company _._ For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Effective Time when Merger Subs designees constitute a majority
of the Company Board, Merger Sub shall cause such designees not to approve any
amendment or termination by the Company of, or any waiver by the Company of,
any of its rights under this Agreement that would adversely affect the holders
of Company Shares (other than Parent and Merger Sub) or extend the time for
performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement,
unless such action is approved by the Independent Committee.

 



 

1.4 _The Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_
") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number
of Company Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole at the
time of such exercise (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), shall
constitute one (1) share more than ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted
Company Shares at such date (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (the "
_Top-Up Amount_ ")), at a price per Company Share equal to the Offer Price.

 



 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in part (i)
following the applicable Expiration Date or, if a Subsequent Offering Period
has been provided for, the expiration of such Subsequent Offering Period and
(ii) prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the applicable Expiration
Date or, if a Subsequent Offering Period has been provided for, the expiration
of such Subsequent Offering Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercisability of the Top-Up Option and the obligation of the Company to
deliver the Top-Up Shares are subject to the conditions that (A) no Law,
injunction, judgment or ruling enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended
or enforced by any Governmental Entity that has the effect of prohibiting the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or preventing the issuance and delivery of the
Top-Up Shares shall be in effect, (B) the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable for a number of Company Shares in excess of the number of Company
Shares authorized and unissued (treating Company Shares owned by the Company
as treasury shares as unissued) and not otherwise reserved for issuance at the
time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, (C) Merger Sub has accepted for
payment and paid for all Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer upon the
expiration of the applicable Expiration Date or, if a Subsequent Offering
Period has been provided for, the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period
and not withdrawn and (D) following the delivery of the Top-Up Shares, Parent
and its Subsidiaries would taken as a whole own a number of Company Shares
equal to the Top-Up Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option
shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (1) the Effective Time and (2)
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The parties
shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is
accomplished consistent with applicable Laws, including compliance with an
applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the

 



      
 

 



 

Company that Merger Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an
"accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning
of the Securities Act). If (x) the Top-Up Option is exercisable and (y) the
Company Board or the Independent Committee requests in writing that Merger Sub
exercise the Top-Up Option, then Parent shall cause Merger Sub to exercise the
Top-Up Option prior to its expiration; _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not
be required to exercise the Top-Up Option prior to the expiration of a
Subsequent Offering Period that has been provided for pursuant to clause (i)
of the last sentence of Section 1.1(b).

 



 

(c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall notify the Company in writing, and shall certify in such notice (i) the
number of Company Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
immediately preceding the exercise of the Top-Up Option and (ii) the place and
time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up
Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing of (A) the number of
Company Shares then outstanding, (B) the number of Fully Diluted Company
Shares (not assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) with supporting detail
and (C) the Companys computation of the number of Top-Up Shares to be issued.
At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Merger Sub a certificate (or evidence of book-entry ownership)
representing the Top-Up Shares, which certificate (or evidence of book-entry
ownership) may include any legends required by applicable Securities Laws. The
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares or any portion
thereof may be paid by Merger Sub either (1) entirely in cash or (2) by paying
in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-
Up Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
(the " _Promissory Note_ ") having a principal amount equal to the balance of
such purchase price for the Top-Up Shares. The Promissory Note (v) shall be
full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub, (w) shall bear interest at the
rate of interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing from
time to time during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, (x)
shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
the Promissory Note, (y) may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time
without premium or penalty and (z) shall have no other material terms.

 



 

(d) The Top-Up Option, the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or the payment by
Merger Sub to the Company of any consideration, including the Promissory Note,
for the Top-Up Shares shall not be taken into account in any determination of
the fair value (as defined in Section 92A.320 of the Nevada Revised Statutes
(" _NRS_ ")) of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500,
inclusive, and none of the parties hereto shall take any position to the
contrary in any appraisal proceeding commenced pursuant to NRS 92A.490.

 



 

1.5 _Adjustment to Offer Price_. If, following the date hereof, the Company
changes or establishes a record date for changing the number of Company Shares
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company
Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or other

 



      
 

 



 

similar transaction in respect of the outstanding Company Shares, in each case
effected with Parents prior written consent in compliance with Section 7.2,
and the record date therefor shall be prior to the earlier to occur of the
Acceptance Time and the Effective Time (such earlier time, the " _Applicable
Time_ "), then, in any such event, the Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect that change.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2** 
**THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, in accordance with the NRS, Merger Sub shall be merged with

Offer ** __** or, if a Subsequent Offering Period has been provided for, such
Subsequent Offering Period ** __** (including through the exercise of the Top-
Up Option) (the " _Short Form Merger Threshold_"), the parties hereto agree
to take appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective in
accordance with NRS 92A.180, without a meeting of the stockholders of Merger
Sub or the Company, as soon as practicable after (i) the satisfaction or

Threshold, the parties hereto agree to take all action required to cause the
Merger to become effective in accordance with the NRS as soon as practicable
after the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article 8. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing

waiver of those conditions), unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Jenner and Block LLP, 353 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the NRS with respect to the merger of two domestic corporations (as defined in
NRS 92A.025).

 



 

2.5 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other actions are necessary, desirable
or proper to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation, the title to any property or rights of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by reason of, or as a result of, the Merger, the Company agrees
that the Surviving Corporation and its officers and directors shall and will
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments and assurances in law and do
all things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to
such property or rights in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry
out the purpose of this Agreement, and that the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized and directed in the name of the
Company or otherwise to take any and all such actions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3** 
**THE SURVIVING CORPORATION**

 



 

3.1 _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the Company
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided in the NRS.

 



 

3.2 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as
provided by the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the
NRS.

 



 

3.3 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Merger Sub in
office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and shall
thereafter serve in such capacity or capacities, in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the NRS,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. To the extent the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in effect at
the Effective Time require the classification of the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation, the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time shall be assigned to and allocated among such classes by Parent
in its sole discretion,

 



       
 

 



 

subject to any applicable limitations set forth in the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or the NRS.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4** 
**EFFECT OF THE MERGER**

 



 

4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any stock or
other equity ownership interest of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) Each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except as otherwise provided in Section 4.1(a)(ii), except for Dissenting
Shares and except for Company Time Vested Restricted Shares and Company
Performance-Based Restricted Shares that are cancelled in accordance with
Section 4.4) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such Company
Shares, when so converted, no longer shall be outstanding and automatically
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate, or evidence of Company Shares held in book-entry form,
representing any such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 4.2.

 



 

(ii) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub (including as a result of an exercise of the
Top-Up Option) or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
the Company, if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one
(1) share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent with the prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of the Company if the Offer Termination shall have occurred (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, the cash in
immediately available funds required to make payments in respect of the Merger
Consideration as required by Section 4.1(a)(i) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated "A-1" or "P-1" or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a
combination of the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. To the extent there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reasons below
the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required
to be paid pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i), Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a)(i) shall be
promptly returned to Parent.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, or evidence
of Company Shares held in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_
"), and whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i), (i) a letter of
transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of
Transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto (or receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in the case
of a book-entry transfer) and such other documents as the Exchange Agent shall
reasonably require, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Share
formerly evidenced thereby, in accordance with Section 4.1(a)(i), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until surrendered as provided
in this Section 4.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration for each Company Share evidenced thereby. No interest
will be paid or accrue on any amounts payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

 



 

(c) All Merger Consideration paid upon exchange of the Company Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares so exchanged.

 



 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 4 will thereafter look only to
Parent for payments in respect of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any of the Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any amounts payable
in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the

 



      
 

 



 

property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement (including any payments made pursuant to the Offer and the
Merger, any payments made in respect of the Dissenting Shares and any payments
made in respect of Company Stock Options) to any holder of Company Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be.
Any amounts deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation to the appropriate Governmental Entity on a timely
basis.

 



 

(g) If any cash payment is to be made pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i) in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it will be a condition of such payment that (i) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the making of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is inapplicable and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer.

 



 

(h) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such Person of a bond, in customary amount and upon such terms as may be
required by the Surviving Corporation, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will

4.4 _Treatment of Company Stock-Based Securities_.

 



 

(a) Each outstanding option to purchase Company Shares (a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") granted under any stock option plan, program or agreement to which
the Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries is a party that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Applicable Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be cancelled as of the Applicable Time and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over
(y) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by
(B) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Applicable Time, whether or not then exercisable (the
" _Company Stock Option Consideration_ "). The Company shall pay to holders of
the Company Stock Options the Company Stock Option Consideration, if any, as
soon as practicable after the Applicable Time and in any case within five (5)
Business Days thereafter. Such cash payment shall be without interest and
subject to and reduced by all applicable Taxes to be withheld in respect of
such payment. For any Company Stock Option where no payment is required to be
made under this Section 4.4(a) because such payment amount would be equal to
or less than zero, such Company Stock Option will be cancelled and terminated
at the Applicable Time without any exercise thereof and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) Each award of a Company Time Vested Restricted Share that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Applicable Time shall automatically become fully
vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions and shall be cancelled as of
the Applicable Time and the holder thereof (or the Person in whose name the
Company holds such Company Time Vested Restricted Share) shall be entitled
only to the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Company Time Vested Restricted Share (the "
_Company Time Vested Restricted Share Consideration_ "). The Company shall
pay to holders of, or the persons in whose name the Company holds, the Company
Time Vested Restricted Shares the Company Time Vested Restricted Share
Consideration as soon as practicable after the Applicable Time and in any case
within five (5) Business Days thereafter. Such cash payment shall be without
interest and subject to and reduced by all applicable Taxes to be withheld in
respect of such payment.

 



 

(c) Each Company Performance-Based Restricted Share Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Applicable Time shall automatically become fully
vested at the "target" level (or such other level or number of Company Shares
specified in such Company Performance-Based Restricted Share Award that shall
vest at the Applicable Time) with respect to all open performance periods __
and free of any forfeiture restrictions and shall be cancelled as of the
Applicable Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each
Company Performance-Based Restricted Share vested pursuant to the terms of
such Company Performance-Based Restricted Share Award (the " _Company
Performance-Based Restricted Share Consideration_ "). The Company shall pay
to holders of, or to the persons in whose name the Company holds, the Company
Performance-Based Restricted Shares the Company Performance-Based Restricted
Share Consideration as soon as practicable after the Applicable Time and in
any case within five (5) Business Days thereafter. Such cash payment shall be
without interest and subject to and reduced by all applicable Taxes to be
withheld in respect of such payment. For any Company Performance-Based
Restricted Share Right where no payment is required to be made under this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.4(c) because no Company Shares would be issued upon the vesting at
the "target" level at the Applicable Time (or such other level or number of

Award that shall vest at the Applicable Time) of the Company Performance-Based
Restricted Share Award pursuant to which such Company Performance-Based
Restricted Share Right was awarded, such Company Performance-Based Restricted
Share Right will be cancelled and terminated as of the Applicable Time and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) The Company will not tender in the Offer any Company Time Vested
Restricted Shares or Company Performance-Based Restricted Shares or release
any transfer restrictions thereon in connection with the Offer, except to the
extent such Company Time Vested Restricted Shares or Company Performance-Based
Restricted Shares vest prior to the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the applicable award agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, at the
Applicable Time, (i) the Company Stock Plan and any similar plan, program or
agreement of the Company shall be terminated and (ii) no Person shall have any
right under or with respect to the Company Stock Options, the Company Time
Vested Restricted Shares, the Company Performance-Based Restricted Share
Awards, the Company Performance-Based Restricted Shares, the Company
Performance-Based Restricted Share Rights, the Company Stock Plan or any other
plan, program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof, except the right to receive the amounts payable
under this Section 4.4, if any. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall instruct its stock transfer agent, promptly after the Applicable Time
(and in any event no later than on the first (1st) Business Day after the
Applicable Time occurs), to remove all Company Time Vested Restricted Shares
and Company Performance-Based Restricted Shares from the Companys stock
ledger. The Company shall provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option, each Person in
whose name the Company holds any Company Time Vested Restricted Share or
Company Performance-Based Restricted Share and each recipient of an
outstanding Company Performance-Based Restricted Share Award describing the
treatment of such Company Stock Option, Company Time Vested Restricted Share,
Company Performance-Based Restricted Share or Company Performance-Based
Restricted Share Award (and any Company Performance-Based Restricted Share
Rights in respect thereof), as applicable, in accordance with this Section
4.4.

 



 

(f) The Company shall take all steps reasonably required to cause the

to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

4.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Pursuant to NRS 92A.390, holders of Company Shares
shall have no right to dissent with respect to the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if it is determined that such
right to dissent is not eliminated by operation of any applicable Laws,
including NRS 92A.390, Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded payment of fair
value (as defined in NRS

 



      
 

 



 

92A.320) for such Company Shares in accordance with the requirements of the
NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive. If any
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the
right to demand payment of fair value in respect of such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive, such Dissenting Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section
4.1(a)(i). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisals or payment of fair value in respect of
Company Shares and any withdrawals of such demands, as well as copies of any
instruments or documents served pursuant to the NRS and received by the
Company with respect to such demands, and the Parent shall have the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for
such Dissenting Shares under the provisions of the NRS will receive payment
thereof from the Surviving Corporation and as of the Effective Time such
Company Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist.

 



 

4.6 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, following the date hereof, the
Company changes or establishes a record date for changing the number of
Company Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for Company Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or
other similar transaction in respect of the outstanding Company Shares, in
each case effected with Parents prior written consent in compliance with
Section 7.2, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective
Time, then, in any such event, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect that change.

indemnification obligations, and there has been no other event with respect to
any Company Plan that could result in any liability for the Company or any
Subsidiary related to any excise Taxes under the Code or to any liabilities
under ERISA, or to any other Taxes or liabilities under any other applicable
Laws, except for prohibited transactions or events that have not had, and,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(k) No Company Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of this

any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the

thereunder and other official guidance issued thereunder (collectively, "
_Section 409A_"), and is in documentary compliance with the applicable
provisions of Section 409A. With respect to each Company Plan that is not
intended to be subject to Section 409A because it is not a nonqualified

application, all the conditions required to retain such treatment remain in
effect and are not reasonably expected to change so as to subject such Company
Plan to Section 409A.

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

nor (ii) been under civil or criminal investigation, indictment or audit by a
Governmental Entity (except routine audits by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency) with respect to any Government Contract, except for those audits that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a

Company, there exist no facts or circumstances that would warrant the
institution of a civil or criminal investigation, indictment, suspension or
debarment proceedings or the finding of nonresponsibility or ineligibility on
the part of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their officers, employees,
consultants or agents.

any non-U.S. government in connection with any Government Contract or
Government Bid contained on the date so furnished or submitted (or on any
other date where such statement, representation or warranty is deemed made or
brought down as of a subsequent date either under applicable Law or pursuant
to the applicable Government Contract or Government Bid or any exhibit thereto

representation, certification, disclosure obligation or contract term with
respect to a Government Contract or Government Bid.

any future Government Contract.

_however_ , that any information set forth in one section of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to apply to each other section or

breaches or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

7.3 _Employee Matters_.

individual who is an active employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing (including each person who is on vacation,
temporary layoff, leave of absence, sick leave or short- or long-term
disability (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ")) for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2012 or (ii) the
one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date: (A) base salary not less than
the base salary provided to such Continuing Employee as in effect immediately
preceding the Closing Date and (B) employee benefits (but not including any
equity-based grants, nonqualified deferred compensation benefits or severance
benefits) that are, in the aggregate, substantially equivalent to the employee
benefits provided to such Continuing Employee as in effect immediately
preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the immediately
preceding subsections (A) and (B) shall not apply to any Continuing Employee
who is a party to an employment agreement or other similar agreement between
such Continuing Employee and the Company or an Affiliate of the Company;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that no Continuing Employee shall be
eligible to participate in any defined benefit pension plan sponsored by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as a promise to employ any Continuing Employee
for any period of time or as a limitation on the right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, take all
necessary action so that each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for
all service with the Company and its Affiliates to the same extent as if such
services had been rendered to Parent or any of its Affiliates under each
benefit plan, program or arrangement established, maintained or contributed to
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and the amount or level of benefits, but
in no event shall such recognition be taken into account (i) in determining
the accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or for any
other purpose under any defined benefit pension plan or (ii) to the extent it
creates any duplication of benefits or benefit accruals.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which such
Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date and
(ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit under any general leave,
welfare plan or fringe benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate after the Closing Date for any co-payments and
deductibles paid by such

 



      
 

 



 

Continuing Employee for the then-current plan year under the corresponding
welfare or fringe benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each
Continuing Employee for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, a severance benefit package
that is equivalent to the severance benefit package that would be provided
under the applicable Company Plan immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, unless such Continuing Employee is terminated for "cause" (as
defined in the applicable Company Plan); _provided_ that the obligation to
provide severance benefits shall not apply to any Continuing Employee who is
not covered or eligible for severance benefits under the applicable Company
Plan in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_
_further_ , that this Section 7.3(d) shall not apply to any Continuing
Employee who is a party to an employment agreement or other similar agreement
between such Continuing Employee and the Company or Affiliate of the Company
that otherwise provides for severance or other similar benefits.

 



 

(e) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that at
the Applicable Time, for any Company Plan with a change in control provision,
a "change in control" will occur under all such Company Plans.

 



 

(f) In the event that payments in respect of the Companys 2011 Short-Term
Incentive Program have not been paid prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay a lump-sum cash payment at
the "target" level to each participant in such program at the normally
scheduled time of such payments, provided such participant has not voluntarily
terminated (as determined in good faith) his/her employment or consulting
arrangement prior to such payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall be treated as an amendment of any Company Plan.

 



 

(g) No provision of this Agreement (i) will create or be deemed to create any
third-party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create
or be deemed to constitute or create an employment agreement, (iii) constitute
or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan sponsored
or maintained by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
or (iv) limit the discretion or authority of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to interpret the respective employee benefit and compensation
plans, agreements, arrangements and programs, in accordance with their terms
and applicable law.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall prohibit
Parent from, subject to applicable Law, adding, deleting or changing providers
of benefits, changing, increasing or decreasing co-payments, deductibles or
other requirements for coverage or benefits (e.g., utilization review or pre-
certification requirements), and/or making other changes in the administration
or in the design, coverage and benefits provided to employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed
as a

 



      
 

 



 

limitation on the right of the Parent to suspend, amend, modify or terminate
any employee benefit plan.

 



 

7.4 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
operations prior to the Applicable Time.

 



 

7.5 _No Solicitation by Company_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Sections 7.5(c) and 7.5(d), during the term of this Agreement
the Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives and its
Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage the making by any Person (other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) initiate or enter into any discussions or negotiations with any
Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal, including by furnishing any non-
public information to any Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement that would require the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated, any communications, discussions or negotiations with any
party or parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal being discussed
prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 7.5 shall preclude the Company or any of its Representatives from
contacting any such party or parties solely for the purpose of complying with
the provisions of the next sentence of this Section 7.5(a). The Company shall
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal, if
any, to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days after the Companys receipt) of any proposal or
inquiry received after the date hereof by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including through any of the Representatives of the Company)
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of (or if oral, a
written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the Companys
understanding of the material terms of) any such proposal or inquiry
(including the identity of the Person from which it was received). The Company
shall (i) keep Parent informed on a prompt basis as to the status of and any
material developments regarding any such proposal or inquiry (including any
negotiations or discussions with respect thereto), as well as any material
modification or amendment thereto, (ii) promptly following receipt or delivery
thereof, provide Parent with copies of all drafts and versions of agreements
(including schedules and exhibits) relating thereto exchanged between the
Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of the Representatives of the
Company and any such third party or their respective Representatives and (iii)
promptly make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to any Person in connection
therewith that has not previously been made available to Parent in a
substantially similar form, subject to applicable Law. Neither the

 



      
 

 



 

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement,
enter into any confidentiality agreement with a Person making, or indicating
an interest in making, an Acquisition Proposal that would prohibit them from
providing any of the foregoing information to Parent.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.5(a) and Section 7.5(b) or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the earlier to occur
of the Acceptance Time and the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
following the receipt after the date hereof by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, which proposal was
not solicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.5,
the Company Board may (directly or through the Companys Representatives)
furnish information to (for which only compliance with clauses (i) and (iii)
below shall be required), or enter into negotiations with, any Person that has
made such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that:
(i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the Company
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and (iii) prior to furnishing such information, the
Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms similar to and no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit the Company from complying with
its obligations under this Agreement, including Section 7.5(b)).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders required to be made by applicable Law in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer)
or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules and Laws will
not in any way modify the effect that any such action has if such disclosure
constitutes a Change of Recommendation.

 



 

(e) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 7.5(e) and Section 7.5(f),
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Acceptance
Time and the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve, adopt or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation or any approval or recommendation by any such committee
regarding this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions,
(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9
or the Proxy Statement (any such action or failure described in clauses (i)
through (iii)

 



       
 

 



 

above being referred to herein as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (iv)
cause, permit or authorize the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with Section 7.5(c)(iii)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Time
and the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in
response to a development or change in circumstances occurring or arising
after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to the Company Board
nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating
to any Acquisition Proposal) (such development or change in circumstances, an
" _Intervening Event_ "), make a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board
has concluded in good faith, after consultation with, and taking into account
the advice of, its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening
Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (such Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event, an " _Intervening Event Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation pursuant to this sentence
unless the Company has (A) given Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (B) taken
into account, in determining whether to make an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation, any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
and any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice during
such three (3) Business Day period.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.5 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Time and the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any duly constituted
committee of the Company Board) may, in response to a Superior Proposal, (i)
effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "
_Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) and concurrently with such
termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for the transactions
contemplated by such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not effect a Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and any purported
Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation or termination pursuant to Section
9.1(f) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless (A) the Company shall
have complied in all material respects with the provisions of this Section
7.5, including the notification provisions in this Section 7.5(f), and, with
respect to a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(f), with all applicable
requirements of Sections 9.1(f) and 9.3(a)(v) (including the payment of the
Termination Fee prior to such termination) in connection with such Superior
Proposal and (B) after consultation with, and taking into account the advice
of, its outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board (or any duly constituted committee of the Company Board) or the
Company shall not exercise its right to effect a Superior Proposal Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f): (1)
until after the third (3rd) Business Day following actual receipt by Parent of
notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company has received a
Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal and attaching the most current versions of
the definitive agreement, all

 



      
 

 



 

exhibits and other attachments thereto and all agreements (such as stockholder
agreements) ancillary thereto to effect such Superior Proposal, and
identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") and stating that the Company Board intends to effect any Superior
Proposal Change of Recommendation or to cause the Company to exercise its
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ _and_ _agreed_ that, prior to any Superior Proposal Change of
Recommendation or any termination pursuant to Section 9.1(f) taking effect,
any amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal
(such amended Superior Proposal, a " _Modified Superior Proposal_ ") shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period (equal to
the greater of one (1) Business Day and the remaining time under the previous
Notice Period) with respect to such Modified Superior Proposal), during which
Notice Period the Company will and will cause its Representatives to negotiate
in good faith with Parent so that Parent may propose an adjustment to this
Agreement or any terms hereof for the purpose of causing the Acquisition
Proposal to no longer be a Superior Proposal, and (2) unless following the end
of the current Notice Period, the Company Board (or any duly constituted
committee thereof) concludes in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and after taking into consideration any
changes to this Agreement and the Transactions proposed by Parent in response
to the Notice of Superior Proposal, that the Superior Proposal to which the
Notice of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior Proposal. For
the avoidance of doubt, there may be multiple Notice Period extensions in the
event of multiple Modified Superior Proposals.

election), to the extent permissible under Law and the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws, act by written consent in lieu of the Company
Stockholders Meeting to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, in
which case the Company shall, in accordance with and subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, as promptly as practicable after such action
by written consent, file the Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy
Statement to be printed and mailed to the stockholders of the Company so as to
enable the action by written consent to become effective as promptly as

after consultation with its legal counsel, should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and
mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement
or any amendment or supplement thereto and shall furnish the Company with all
information required to be included therein with respect to Parent or Merger
Sub. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy

comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii)
shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement
promptly following written request therefor from the Company.

 



 

(c) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required by Law to consummate the
Merger, then the Company shall have the right, at any time after the Offer
Termination Date or the Offer Closing, to (and Parent and Merger Sub shall
have the right, at any time after the Offer Termination Date or the Offer
Closing, to request in writing that the Company, and upon receipt of such
written request, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days) (x) establish a record date for and give
notice of a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") and (y)
mail to the Companys stockholders as of the record date established for the
Company Stockholder Meeting the Proxy Statement (the date the Company elects
to take such action or is required to take such action, the  _Proxy Date_
"). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date. If the
Offer Closing shall have occurred, the record date for determining eligibility
to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be after the date on which
Merger Sub shall have purchased and paid for, and been recognized by the
Company as the record owner of, the Company Shares duly tendered in, and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of, the Offer and any Subsequent Offering
Period that has been provided for. If the Company Stockholder Approval is
required by the NRS to consummate the Merger, and unless the Company Board
shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation thereof or

7.5(e) or (f), the Company shall (i) advise in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger and recommend to its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval

Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other Company Shares owned by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the Merger.

 



 

(e) If any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

7.8 _HSR Filings; Other Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) Parent and the Company undertake and agree to file as soon as practicable

under any other applicable Regulatory Law.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under

obligation shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any request by the FTC, DOJ or other Governmental Entity, as
applicable, for additional information and documents or any investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii)
promptly inform the other party of any material communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions, (iii) permit the other party to review any communication
given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the parties may comply

 



      
 

 



 

with this clause (iii) by designating that certain sensitive information shall
only be shared with the respective parties outside legal counsel), (iv)
promptly take reasonable actions to respond to inquiries from the FTC, DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity regarding the legality under any antitrust Law
of the Transactions and (v) take or cause to be taken all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 7.8 to cause the
expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt
of required authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that all obligations in this Section
7.8(b) shall be subject to applicable Laws relating to exchange of information
and attorney-client communication and privileges.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including Section 7.6 hereof and this Section 7.8), neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor any of their Affiliates is required to (i) enter into any agreement,
consent decree or other commitment requiring Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to
divest or hold separate any assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) or (ii) take
any other action that, individually or in the aggregate, would impose a
material restriction on the conduct of the business of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the business of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



 

7.9 _Nasdaq Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the Nasdaq to enable the delisting of the Surviving Corporation
and of the Company Shares from the Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. The Company will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Shares to remain listed for
trading on the Nasdaq at all times prior to the Effective Time.

exchange of information, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,

representatives of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers and employees
and all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records (including
Tax Returns, work papers of independent auditors and information concerning
its personnel), which the parties agree may be afforded in whole or in part
through electronic means. During such period, the Company will, and will cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Securities Laws (other than reports or
documents that the Company or Subsidiary of the Company is not permitted to
disclose under applicable Law). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 7.10, the Company shall not be obligated to devote any resources
to create any requested information that does not exist at the time of such
request.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent nor any of
their Subsidiaries will be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that the
Company will nonetheless provide Parent and its Representatives with
appropriate information regarding the factual basis underlying any
circumstances that resulted in the preparation of such privileged analyses) or
contravene any Law or binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any such
agreements counterparty to such inspection or disclosure and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay any amount or waive
any rights to obtain such consent). The parties will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9
or the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, will
promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC and/or mailing to the stockholders of the Company of such
amendment or supplement, in each case as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(c) All information provided to Parent and its representatives pursuant to

and, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 9, such
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(d) No investigation by Parent or any of its Representatives and no other
receipt of information by Parent or any of its Representatives shall operate
as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation or warranty of the Company
or any covenant or other provision in this Agreement.

 



 

7.11 _Public Statements_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, agree that, from the date hereof through the Closing
Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be
issued or made by any party without the prior consent of the other party or
parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (a) as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
the rules or regulations of the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or any
applicable United States securities exchange, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party or parties
reasonable time (to the extent practicable) to review and comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and (b) that each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective Affiliates may make
such an announcement to their respective employees, customers and suppliers,
after consultation with the other parties.

 



 

7.12 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or officer may
have under any employment or indemnification agreement, for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (each, an " _Indemnitor_ ") shall

 



      
 

 



 

indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law (and shall also advance expenses to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law), each present and former director, officer and employee of the
Company or and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or before the
Effective Time, including the Transactions; _provided_ , that, prior to any
such advancement, an Indemnified Party shall deliver to such Indemnitor a
written undertaking, executed personally or on such Indemnified Partys
behalf, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by an applicable
Governmental Entity that he or she did not meet the prescribed standards of
conduct for indemnification under applicable Law (which undertaking shall be
an unlimited general obligation of such Indemnified Party but need not be
secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make
repayment).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Applicable Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, ** __** Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, purchase prepaid, non-cancellable "tail" or "run-off"
coverage on the existing policies of directors and officers liability and
fiduciary liability insurance (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been delivered to Parent or evidence of insurance if policies have not been
issued yet for the current policy period) maintained by the Company as of the
date of this Agreement (" _D andO and Fiduciary Insurance_"). Such tail or run-
off coverage shall be for a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time and otherwise on terms and conditions that are
no less favorable than as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Company is unable to purchase
such DandO and Fiduciary Insurance prior to the Effective Time and such DandO and
Fiduciary Insurance is not available at a cost per annum less than two hundred
fifty percent (250%) **** of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
hereof under the Companys DandO and Fiduciary Insurance policies (the "
_Insurance Cap_ "), then Parent shall cause to be obtained as much comparable
insurance as can reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment at a cost
up to but not exceeding the Insurance Cap. If the Company is unable to
purchase such DandO and Fiduciary Insurance prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent as necessary to enable Parent to obtain
the aforementioned DandO and Fiduciary Insurance, ** __** including authorizing
Parent, through its insurance representative, to solicit DandO and Fiduciary
Insurance ** __** coverage proposals directly with the Companys current
insurance companies ** _._**

 



 

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving limited liability company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.12.

 



 

(d) This Section 7.12 is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third-party
rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.12 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 



 

(f) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
7.12, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to so notify the Indemnitor will not affect the obligations of
the Indemnitor under this Section 7.12 unless and to the extent that the
Indemnitor is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

7.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to Section 4.5, the Company shall keep
Parent informed of, give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense
or settlement of, and cooperate with Parent in connection with, any
stockholder litigation or claim against the Company and/or its directors or
officers relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior to or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company agrees that it will not
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any litigation commenced
prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or any of its
directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any other Transaction,
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

7.14 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish,
amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which
compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided,
in each case to any current or former director, manager, officer, employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless, prior
to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation
Committee (each member of which the Company Board determined is an
"independent director" within the meaning of Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2) and shall
be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have
taken all such steps as may be necessary to (a) approve as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act each such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to
such plan, program, agreement or arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this Section 7.14 shall permit the Company to take any
action that would be prohibited under any other provision of this Agreement,
including under any covenant in Section 7.2 hereof.

 



 

7.15 _Takeover Laws_. Each of the Company and the Company Board will take all
actions to cause the Transactions (a) not to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and will take all necessary steps within its
reasonable control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Transactions from any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect
and (b) to comply with any Takeover Provisions and will take all necessary
steps within its reasonable control to make the Transactions comply with (or
continue to comply with) any Takeover Provisions. If any Takeover Law or
Takeover Provision becomes applicable to the Transactions, each of the Company
and the Company Board will, upon the request of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or Merger Sub, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law or Takeover Provision on the Transactions.

interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless a contrary
intention appears, (a) the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" and other
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section or other subdivision, (b) the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation" and are intended by the parties to be by way of example rather
than limitation and (c) reference to any Article or Section means such Article
or Section hereof, unless otherwise indicated. Any references in this
Agreement to "the date hereof" refer to the date of execution of this
Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. No provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted or construed against any party hereto solely
because such party or its legal representative drafted such provision.

 



 

10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and annexes
hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and
the other documents and instruments referred to herein), together with the
Confidentiality Agreement and any agreements entered into contemporaneously

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
except that Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parents other direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiaries, and except that Parent may assign any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parents other
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

10.10 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY
CONFLICT-OF-LAWS RULE OR PRINCIPLE THEREOF (OTHER THAN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

10.11 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of
Manhattan and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in
the Southern District of New York ** __** solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such a New York State or Federal court. The
parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject
matter of such dispute and

 



       
 

 



 

agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.5 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service

10.12 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the party
seeking such injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief has an
adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. In the event that any
party seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such
party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction or other order, decree, ruling or
judgment.

solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and except for Section 7.12,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
other Person any third-party beneficiary rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

10.15 _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement be judicially
declared to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision will not have the
effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, and the
part or parts of this Agreement so held to be invalid, unenforceable or void
will be deemed to have been stricken herefrom, and the remainder will have the
same force and effectiveness as if such stricken part or parts had never been
included herein so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A

AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER

 **Article III, Section 11 of the Bylaws has been amended in its entirety to
read as follows:**

 



 

Section 11. Committees. By resolution adopted by a majority of all the
directors in office when the action is taken, the board of directors may
designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other
committees, and appoint one or more members of the board of directors to serve
on them. To the extent provided in the resolution, each committee shall have
all the authority of the board of directors, except that no such committee
shall have the authority to (i) authorize distributions, (ii) approve or
propose to shareholders actions or proposals required by the NRS Chapter 78 to
be approved by shareholders, (iii) fill vacancies on the board of directors or
any committee thereof, (iv) amend articles of incorporation, (v) adopt, amend

pursuant to a formula or method prescribed by the board of directors, or

board of directors may authorize a committee or officer to do so within limits
specifically prescribed by the board of directors and the NRS Chapter 78. The
committee shall then have full power within the limits set by the board of
directors to adopt any final resolution setting forth all preferences,
limitations and relative rights of such class or series and to propose an
amendment of the articles of incorporation stating the preferences,
limitations and relative rights of a class or series for a vote by the
shareholders and filing with the Secretary of State under the NRS Chapter 78.

 



 

The foregoing paragraph of this Section 11 shall be in full force and effect
until the occurrence, if any, of the "Acceptance Time" (as defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 7, 2011, by and among
General Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Falcon
Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation ("Merger Sub"), and the corporation,
as may be amended from time to time (the "Merger Agreement")) and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the occurrence, if any, of the
Acceptance Time, the foregoing paragraph of this Section 11 shall be of no
further force or effect and shall be replaced in its entirety with the
following:

 



 

"Section 11. Committees. By resolution adopted at a meeting of the board of
directors by a majority of all the directors in office when the action is
taken, the board of directors may designate from among its members one or more
committees and appoint one or more members of the board of directors to serve
on them. Subject to applicable law and to the extent provided in the
resolution, any such committee shall have and may exercise all the powers of
the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
corporation."

 



 

Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 of Article III, which govern meetings, notice,
waiver of notice, quorum, voting requirements and action without a meeting of

board of directors may authorize the issuance of shares for consideration
consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the
corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed or to be
performed or other securities of the corporation. Future services shall not
constitute payment or partial payment for shares of the corporation. The
promissory note of a subscriber or an affiliate of a subscriber shall not
constitute payment or partial payment for shares of the corporation unless the
note is negotiable and is secured by collateral, other than the shares being
purchased, having a fair market value at least equal to the principal amount
of the note. For purposes of this Section 2, "promissory note" means a
negotiable instrument on which there is an obligation to pay independent of
collateral and does not include a nonrecourse note.

 



 

The foregoing paragraph of this Section 2 shall be in full force and effect

performed or other securities of the corporation."
