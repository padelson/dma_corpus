 Section 2.01 _ The Offer._ 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 9.01_ and none of the events set forth in _Exhibit A_ shall have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day following commencement of the Offer. The obligation of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Offer Securities tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (any of which may be waived by Sub in its sole discretion, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived) and to the other conditions in this Agreement. Sub expressly reserves the right to modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the Company (unless the Company takes any action permitted to be taken pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_), Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of Offer Securities subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, the Series D Offer Price or the Warrant Offer Price, (iii) modify or add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_, (iv) except as provided in the next sentence, extend the Offer or (v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Sub shall extend the Offer for one ten (10) Business Day period if the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied at the expiration of the initial twenty (20) Business Day Offer period and (ii) thereafter, Sub may, without the consent of the Company and in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for successive extension periods (up until the Outside Date) not exceeding twenty (20) Business Days in the case of any single extension period: (A) if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to Sub\'s obligation to purchase Offer Securities are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived; and (B) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or the Nasdaq National Market applicable to the Offer. In addition, Sub may extend the Offer after acceptance for payment of Offer Securities for a further period of time not to exceed twenty (20) Business Days by means of a subsequent offering period under Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall pay for all Offer Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer. Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more Subsidiary of Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the Offer Securities tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Sub or Parent of its respective obligations under the Offer or prejudice the rights of tendering securityholders to receive payment for Offer Securities validly tendered and accepted for payment. 

   

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ " and to cause such Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Offer Securities in accordance with applicable Federal Securities laws). The Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other Applicable Law. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer, and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or 

     

supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to

by applicable Federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
(including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its counsel. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Offer Securities, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.

Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession. 

  

 Section 2.03 _ Board of Directors; Section 14(f)._ 

   

 (a) If requested by Parent, upon the acceptance for payment of the Offer Securities to be purchased pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company Board (and on each committee of the Company Board and on the board of directors of each Company Subsidiary as designated by Parent) as will give Parent representation on the Company Board (or such committee or Company Subsidiary board of directors) equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (or such committee or Company Subsidiary board of directors) giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A) such number of shares of Company Common Stock that would, assuming the full conversion 

     

of all Company Series D Stock and the full exercise of all Warrants, then be
owned by Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that would, assuming the full conversion of
all Company Series D Stock and the full exercise of all Warrants, then be
outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, cause Parent\'s designees
to be so appointed or elected. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
cause the persons designated by Parent to be directors on the Company Board
(or a committee of the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company
Subsidiaries as designated by Parent) pursuant to the preceding sentence to be
so appointed or elected (whether, at the request of Parent, by means
of increasing the size of the Company Board (or such committee or Company
Subsidiary board of directors) or seeking the resignation of directors and
causing Parent\'s designees to be appointed or elected). Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 2.03, the parties hereto shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause at least two of the members of the
Company Board, at all times prior to the Effective Time, to be individuals
who were directors of the Company and were not officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (the " _Continuing
Directors_ "); _provided, however,_ that if at any time prior to the Effective
Time there shall be in office only one Continuing Director for any reason,
the Company Board shall cause a person who is not an officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries designated by the remaining Continuing
Director to fill such vacancy (and such person shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement), and if at any time
prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall use reasonable efforts to
designate two persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers or employees
or affiliates of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition Sub or
any of their respective affiliates (and such persons shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement).

  

 (b) The Company\'s obligation to appoint designees of Parent and/or Sub to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.03_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to enable Parent\'s designees to be elected to the Company Board. Parent and Sub will supply to the Company any information with respect to any of them and their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

   

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ and prior to the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors or if there shall only be one, of a Continuing Director, shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any amendment or termination of this Agreement, extension for the performance or waiver of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Sub or waiver of the Company\'s rights hereunder. 

   

 Section 2.04 _ Top-Up Option._ 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on or after the Determination Time, to purchase that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided, however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise Sub would own at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding shares of Company Series D Stock; and _provided, further_ , 

     

that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of
shares in excess of the Company\'s then authorized but unissued shares of
Company Common Stock (giving effect to such shares of Company Common Stock
reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Employee Stock Options,
Warrants and shares of Company Series D Stock as though such shares of
Company Common Stock were outstanding).

  

 (b) Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event and prior to the Top-Up Termination Date. The " _Top-Up Termination Date_ " will occur upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the Effective Time; (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms; and (iii) ten (10) Business Days after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event, if Sub has failed to notify the Company in writing of its intent to exercise the Top-Up Option in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Top-Up Exercise Event_ " shall occur only if immediately after consummation of the Offer Sub beneficially owns at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Company Series D Stock.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Sub, in writing, of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

  

 (e) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the following conditions: (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and regulations analogous to the HSR Act existing in foreign jurisdictions relating to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will have expired or been terminated; (ii) no provision of any Applicable Law or regulation and no Order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of any such exercise; and (iii) either (A) delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares would not require the approval of the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market or (B) Sub shall have notified the Company in writing that it intends to cause the Effective Time to occur no later than one (1) Business Day after the Top-Up Closing. 

  

 (f) Parent and Sub understand that the shares of Company Common Stock that Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public transaction. Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an Accredited Investor, as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.

In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit cash in the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to such deficiency. 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates, other than holders of Certificates representing Excluded Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, for each share of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock, as the case may be, which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay to the Paying Agent any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or (B) establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is otherwise not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenters\' Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Sections 3.01(c)_ and  _3.01(d)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. 

     

 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock._ The Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law) for payment of its claim for Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be. 

  

 (e) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (g) _ Withholding Rights._ Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. If Parent, Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series D Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made by Parent, Sub, or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (h) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with _Section 3.01_, provided that the Person to whom the Common Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as the case may be, is paid shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify the Surviving Corporation and Parent in a manner satisfactory to it (including, without limitation, the posting by such Person of such bond and security as the Surviving Corporation and Parent may reasonably request) against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation and Parent with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 Section 4.04 _ Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action._ 

   

 (a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of it pursuant to or in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and except for the Company Stockholder Approval in the case of the Merger (if required), no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Sub), a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity. 

  

 (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held prior to execution of this Agreement, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving, adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) recommending that the holders of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, and (iv) recommending that the 

     

Company\'s stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement, if necessary. Such
resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and Sub and this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL. The Company has been advised by each of its directors
and officers that each such Person intends to tender all shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such Person pursuant to the Offer, except to the extent

No vote or approval of any holder of Company Capital Stock is necessary to consummate the Offer or any Transaction other than the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.05 _ No Conflicts; Consents._ Except as set forth in _Section 4.05_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person under, or impose any penalty or fine under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under, any provision of (a) the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of the Company Subsidiaries, (b) any Material Contract, (c) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any provision of any Order or Applicable Law applicable to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the cases of _clause (b)_ or  _(c)_ above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and any applicable laws, regulations or statutes relating to the regulation of monopolies or competition in any foreign jurisdictions, (ii) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Schedule 14D-9, (B) a Proxy Statement, if Company Stockholder Approval is required by Applicable Law, and (C) such reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do business, (iv) such filings as may be required in connection with the Taxes described in _Section 7.08_, (v) such other items as are set forth in _Section 4.05_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and (vi) such Consents, filings or other items, the failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or any committee thereof withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, its position with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger

the commencement of the Offer, or the date of the final expiration of the
Offer; and further specifying that if such Company Employee Stock Options are
not exercised by such date, they shall be terminated as of the Effective
Time. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be subject to
any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.

  

 Section 7.05 _ Prior Agreements._ 

   

 (a) The Standstill Agreement, dated as of August 3, 1998, between Parent and the Company (the " _Standstill Agreement_ ") is hereby terminated and of no further force or effect; provided, however, that in the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without Sub having purchased any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Standstill Agreement shall be deemed reinstated and in full force and effect effective as of the time of such termination of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no action theretofore taken by Parent, Sub or any of their Affiliates in reliance on this _Section 7.05_ shall be deemed to violate the Standstill Agreement as so reinstated. 

   

 (b) The Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 3, 1998, between Parent and the Company and the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of August 3, 1998, between Parent and the Company, each shall be terminated and of no further force or effect immediately upon Sub\'s acceptance of Offer Securities for payment pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 Section 7.06 _ Indemnification; DandO Insurance._ 

  

 (a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or as provided in any director indemnification agreements (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (b) Parent shall cause to be maintained for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time the Company\'s current DandO Insurance policy to the extent that it provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for all persons who are directors and officers of the Company on the date of this Agreement, so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). Upon request by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to extend coverage under the Company\'s DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy (provided that the 

     

lump sum payment to purchase such coverage does not exceed six (6) times the
Maximum Premium) and such "tail" policy shall satisfy Parent\'s obligations
under this _Section 7.06(b)_. Parent\'s obligations under this _Section
7.06(b)_ shall also be satisfied if Parent\'s DandO Insurance provides (or is
amended to provide) substantially similar coverage for events occurring prior
to the Effective Time for persons who are directors and officers of the
Company on the date of this Agreement. If the Company\'s existing DandO
Insurance is terminated or canceled by the insurer during such six-year period
or a "tail" policy cannot be purchased on the terms set forth above and
Parent cannot or determines not to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
7.06(b)_ pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be obtained as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained
for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of
the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the
existing DandO Insurance. The Company represents to Parent that the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement is not greater than
$578,600. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 7.06_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Person without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Person.

  

 (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.06_. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each identified party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 Section 7.07 _ Public Announcements._ Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange and then only with such advance notice to and consultation with the other as is practical. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form agreed to by the parties. 

  

 Section 7.08 _ Transfer Taxes._ Either Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all Transfer Taxes, if any, and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes, payable in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and all Stock Transfer Taxes, if any, and any penalties or interest with respect to any such Stock Transfer Taxes. 

  

 Section 7.09 _ Potential Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the defense or the settlement of any litigation against the Company and its directors relating to any of the Transactions. No settlement of any such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent\'s prior written consent. 

  

 Section 7.10 _ Rights Agreement._ The Company Board shall take all further action (in addition to that referred to in _Section 4.16_) necessary (including redeeming the Rights immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer or amending the Rights Agreement) in order to render the Rights inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer, the Merger and the Top-Up Option. 

  

 Section 7.11 _ Benefits and Employment._ None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Surviving Corporation\'s subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue any Company Plan as of or subsequent to the Effective Time; and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the 

     

right to amend, modify, or terminate any Company Plan at or subsequent to the
Effective Time; provided that the Company shall have the right to terminate
immediately prior to the Closing Date any Company Plan that is then intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Code Section 401(a). Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Surviving Corporation\'s subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive compensation
and benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to those of similarly
situated employees. Such benefits may be provided through continuation of the
Company Plans or through employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation
(or of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation\'s subsidiaries, as the case
may be), including but not limited to defined benefit pension plans and
retiree health plans, maintained, established or contributed to by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Surviving Corporation\'s subsidiaries at
or subsequent to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Surviving
Corporation Plans_ "). The Continuing Employees shall receive full credit for
periods of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accruals) under the Surviving Corporation Plans, other than any
Surviving Corporation Plan which is a retiree health plan, for which
Continuing Employees shall receive credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual only with respect to service for
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries
on and after the Effective Time. Any amounts previously expended by
Continuing Employees for purposes of satisfying deductibles under any Company
Plan for the applicable current plan year shall be credited for purposes of
satisfying any corresponding deductibles under the Surviving Corporation
Plans. No preexisting condition limitations (that would not have been
applicable under the Company Plans) shall be imposed on Continuing Employees
upon admittance into any Surviving Corporation Plan.

 (i) if Sub has not accepted Offer Securities for payment pursuant to the Offer on or before March 31, 2004 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the failure to do so on or before the Outside Date is the result of a breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; or 

  

 (ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an Order, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such Order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 (c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Exhibit A_, and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the Company of such breach; _provided, however_ , that this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this _clause (c)_ if Sub has accepted Offer Securities for payment pursuant to the Offer; 

  

 (d) by Parent: 

  

  

 (i) if the Company Board or any committee thereof withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement or fails to recommend to the Company\'s stockholders that they accept the Offer or give Company Stockholder Approval, or the Company Board or any committee thereof resolves to take any of the foregoing actions; or 

  

 (ii) if the Company Board fails to reaffirm publicly and unconditionally its recommendation to the Company\'s stockholders that they accept the Offer and give Company Stockholder Approval within ten (10) Business Days of Parent\'s written request to do so (which request may only be made at any time following public disclosure of an Alternative Acquisition Proposal), which public reaffirmation must also include the unconditional rejection of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal; 

  

  

 (e) by the Company prior to the acceptance of Offer Securities for payment pursuant to the Offer if, prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company Board shall have determined to approve, endorse or recommend an Alternative Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_ unless (i) at least two (2) Business Days prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_ the Company has provided Parent with written notice advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Company Proposal that it intends to accept, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal, and identifying the Person making such Superior Company Proposal, (ii) the Company has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith with Parent during such two (2) Business Day period to attempt to make such adjustments in the financial terms of an amendment to this Agreement that are equal or superior to the financial terms of such Superior Company Proposal and the Company and Parent have not within such two (2) Business Day period agreed upon such an amendment, and (iii) the Company has paid to (or concurrently pays to) Parent the Base Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.01(e)_ and _Section 9.02_; or 

   (f) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VIII_ and (ii) cannot be cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach (provided that Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this _clause (f) _ if Sub has accepted Offer Securities for payment pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 Section 9.02 _ Effect of Termination; Fees and Expenses._ 

   

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than _Section 4.27_, _Section 5.07_, the last sentence of _Section 7.02(a)_, _Section 7.05(a)_, this _Section 9.02_ and _Article X_ and except to the extent that such termination results from the willful breach by a party of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee in an amount equal to $9 million (the " _Base Termination Fee_ ") immediately upon termination of this Agreement if (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_, or (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, and in either such case if the Company consummates an Alternative Acquisition Proposal within nine (9) months after such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent an additional fee in an amount equal to $6 million (the " _Additional Termination Fee_ " and, together with the Base Termination Fee, the " _Termination Fees_ ") immediately upon consummation of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall pay to Parent the Base Termination Fee plus the Additional Termination Fee if any Person shall have made, proposed, communicated or disclosed in a manner that is or otherwise becomes public prior to or during the pendency of the Offer (which shall include being generally known by securityholders of the Company) an intention to make an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied at the Determination Time, this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms under circumstances other than those set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 9.02(b)_ and an Alternative Acquisition Proposal is consummated within nine (9) months of such termination of this Agreement, in which case such Termination Fees shall be payable immediately upon consummation of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Termination Fees shall not be payable in any event if Parent is then in breach in any material respect of any of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (c) (i) Any payment due under this _Section 9.02_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date such payment becomes payable and (ii) upon failure to pay any such payment on the date due pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_, interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment from such date to the date of actual payment at a variable rate equal to the prime rate (as reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ " _Money Rates_ ") plus 3% per annum. 

  

 (d) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided, however_ , that Parent and the Company shall share equally the filing fees in connection with the HSR Act. 

  

 (e) In addition to the other provisions of this _Section 9.02_, in the event any of the Termination Fees are or become payable pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_, the Company agrees promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days following written notice thereof, to reimburse Parent and Sub for all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and the expenses of litigation, incurred in connection with collecting such amounts. The right to receive the Termination Fees pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_ and other amounts 

     

pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ shall not be the exclusive remedy for any
breach by the Company of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
other provisions of this Agreement and shall be in addition to any other
remedies available at law or in equity to Parent or Sub.

  

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, neither (i) the termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.01_ or (ii) the payment by the Company to Parent of any Termination Fees or any other fees and expenses pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ shall effect, diminish or alter the obligations of Parent and the Company under the Alliance Agreements, including, but not limited to, any obligations of the Company thereunder to make payments to Parent. 

  

 Section 9.03 _ Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further approval by such stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

  

 Section 9.05 _ Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.03_ or an extension or waiver pursuant to _Section 9.04_ shall, in order to be effective, be in writing and require in the case of Parent, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors.

Conditions of the Offer

  

 Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Sub\'s obligation to pay for or return tendered Offer Securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Offer Securities tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (i) there shall have been validly tendered (including by notice of guaranteed delivery) and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (including any extensions thereof in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ of this Agreement) (the " _Determination Time_ ") that number of Offer Securities which would represent, together with all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or Sub, at least a majority in voting power of the Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (ii) the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the purchase of Offer Securities pursuant to the Offer under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have expired and any consents, approvals and filings under any foreign antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the purchase of all Offer Securities tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall have been obtained or made prior to the expiration of the Offer. The term " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities entitled generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise, conversion or termination of all options, warrants, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into such voting securities. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or to pay for any Offer Securities not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, and may terminate or amend the Offer, with the consent of the Company or if, at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the acceptance of any such Offer Securities for payment or the payment therefor, any of the following conditions exists: 

  

 (a) there shall be threatened in writing or pending any Proceeding that has a reasonable likelihood of success, (i) challenging the acquisition by Parent or Sub of any Offer Securities, seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other Transaction, or seeking to obtain from the Company, Parent or Sub any damages that are material in relation to the Company and its Subsidiary taken as a whole, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any material portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to compel the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of Parent or Sub to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any Offer Securities, including the right to vote any Offer Securities purchased by it on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the Company, (iv) seeking to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any material respect the business or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or (v) which otherwise is reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (b) any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, interpretation, judgment, Order or injunction shall be threatened, proposed, sought, enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, amended or issued with respect to, or deemed applicable to, or any consent or approval withheld with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, by any Governmental Entity that is reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (a) above; 

   

 (c) (i) it shall have been publicly disclosed or Parent shall have otherwise learned that beneficial ownership (determined for the purposes of this paragraph as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding shares of the Company 

     

Common Stock has been acquired by another Person (including any group as
defined in the Exchange Act) other than Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and
its Affiliates (" _Cerberus_ "), (ii) Cerberus shall have acquired beneficial
ownership of thirty percent (30%) or more of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock or (iii) the Company Board or any committee thereof
shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub its
approval or recommendation of the Offer and this Agreement or the Company
Board or any committee thereof shall have resolved to take any of the
foregoing actions;

  

 (d) (i) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct or (ii) any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified shall not be true and correct, unless such failure to be true and correct shall not have had a Company Material Adverse Effect and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, in any such case under _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ , as of the Determination Time as though made at the Determination Time, except to the extent that such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date, in which case such representation or warranty need only be so true and correct on and as of such specific date in order to satisfy this condition; 

  

 (e) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement; 

  

 (f) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

   

which, in the sole judgment of Sub or Parent, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including
