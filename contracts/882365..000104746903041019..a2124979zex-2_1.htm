<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of December&nbsp;12, 2003 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), among Abbott Laboratories, an
Illinois corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), Senator Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Sub</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and i-STAT Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to purchase (i)&nbsp;all of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (as defined herein), together with the Rights (as
defined herein) attached thereto, for cash in an amount equal to U.S. $15.35 per share of Company Common Stock (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), (ii)&nbsp;all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Company Series&nbsp;D Stock (as defined herein) for cash in an amount per share equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Company Series&nbsp;D Stock at the Determination Time, without regard to the restrictions on beneficial ownership in Section&nbsp;7(a)(iii)&nbsp;of
the Certificate of Designation of the Company Series&nbsp;D Stock, (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Series&nbsp;D Offer Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and (iii)&nbsp;all outstanding Warrants (as
defined herein) for cash in an amount equal to U.S. $7.35 per share of Company Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Warrants (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Warrant Offer
Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), in each such case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Sub into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), whereby each issued share of Company Common Stock and Company Series&nbsp;D Stock that is not (a)&nbsp;owned directly or
indirectly by Parent or the Company or (b)&nbsp;a Dissenters' Share (as defined herein), will be converted into the right to receive Common Merger Consideration or Series&nbsp;D Merger

after the date of this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The initial expiration date of the
Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day following commencement of the Offer. The obligation of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Offer Securities
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (any of which may be waived
by Sub in its sole discretion, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived) and to the other conditions in this Agreement. Sub expressly reserves the right to modify the terms of the
Offer, except that, without the consent of the Company (unless the Company takes any action permitted to be taken pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;6.02(b)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>),
Sub shall not (i)&nbsp;reduce the number of Offer Securities subject to the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;reduce the Offer Price, the Series&nbsp;D Offer Price or the Warrant Offer Price, (iii)&nbsp;modify
or add to the conditions set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, (iv)&nbsp;except as provided in the next sentence, extend the Offer or (v)&nbsp;change the

satisfied at the expiration of the initial twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Day Offer period and (ii)&nbsp;thereafter, Sub may, without the consent of the Company and in its sole discretion, extend the
Offer for successive extension periods (up until the Outside Date) not exceeding twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days in the case of any single extension period: (A)&nbsp;if at the scheduled expiration
date of the Offer any of the conditions to Sub's obligation to purchase Offer Securities are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived; and (B)&nbsp;for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or the Nasdaq National Market applicable to the Offer. In addition, Sub may extend the Offer after
acceptance for payment of Offer Securities for a further period of time not to exceed twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days by means of a subsequent offering period under Rule&nbsp;14d-11
under the Exchange Act. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall pay for all Offer Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer. Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more Subsidiary of Parent the right
to purchase all or any portion of the Offer Securities tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Sub or Parent of its respective obligations under the Offer
or prejudice the rights of tendering securityholders to receive payment for Offer Securities validly tendered and accepted for payment. </FONT></P>
