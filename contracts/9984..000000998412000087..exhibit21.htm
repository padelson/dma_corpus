the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative have not resolved all such differences by the end of such
20-day period, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall, no later
than ten (10) days following the end of such 20-day period, submit, in
writing, to an independent public accounting firm (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"), their briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount
of each item remaining in dispute, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall
make a written determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses and Closing
Net Working Capital, which determination shall be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be
authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between the
parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.07 within the
range of the difference between the Seller Representative's position set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement with respect thereto and the Purchaser's
position set forth in the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement with
respect thereto. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
accompanied by a certificate of the Independent Accounting Firm that it
reached such determination in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.07. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed by the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative. The Independent Accounting Firm shall render a written
decision resolving the matters submitted to it within 20 days following the
submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written determination of
the Independent Accounting Firm in any court referred to in Section 11.12. The
costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 2.07(c), including
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Purchaser and
the Sellers in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the representatives of each
party incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement and preparation or review of any Notice
of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

(d) Upon the final determination, in accordance with this Section 2.07, of the
Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement and the final calculations of the
amount of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses and
Closing Net Working Capital and the Net Working Capital Adjustment calculated
by reference thereto, the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be recalculated using
such finally determined amounts in lieu of the estimates of such amounts used
in the calculation of the estimated Aggregate Purchase Price payable at the
Closing.

(i) If the Aggregate Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.07 (the "Final Aggregate Purchase Price") exceeds the estimated
Aggregate Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price Shortfall"), the Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid to the Seller Representative, for distribution to the Sellers, the
Purchase Price Shortfall. Each Stockholder will be entitled to receive an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Purchase Price Shortfall and (B) a
fraction equal to (x) the number of Shares owned by such Stockholder at
Closing divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Shares, payable in cash by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Seller Representative at the Closing. Each Optionholder will be
entitled to receive an amount (subject to applicable withholding Tax) equal to
the product of (A) the Purchase Price Shortfall and (B) a fraction equal to
(x) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Options held by such
Optionholder at the Closing divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Shares. Purchaser
shall pay the portion of the Purchase Price Shortfall payable in respect of
the Options to the Company, and the Company shall in turn pay such portion of
the Purchase Price Shortfall (subject to applicable withholding Tax) as
promptly as practicable thereafter through the Company's payroll.

(ii) If the estimated Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Final Aggregate
Purchase Price (the "Purchase Price Excess"), the Sellers shall pay or cause
to be paid to the Purchaser, the Purchase Price Excess. With respect thereto,
each Stockholder shall pay to the Seller Representative, for payment to the
Purchaser, an amount equal to the product of (A) the Purchase Price Excess and
(B) a fraction equal to (x) the number of Shares owned by such Stockholder at
Closing divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Shares, payable in cash by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Seller Representative; and further, with respect thereto, each
Optionholder shall pay to the Seller Representative for payment to the Company
an amount payable to the Purchaser equal to the product of (A) the Purchase
Price Excess and (B) a fraction equal to (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock underlying the Options held by such Optionholder at the Closing divided
by (y) the Fully Diluted Shares.

(e) Any payments required pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be (i) made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than three (3) Business
Days after final determination of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Company
Transaction Expenses and Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.07 and (ii) deemed to be an adjustment to the
Aggregate Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

3.09. Compliance with Applicable Law. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is, and for the past two years has been, in material compliance
with all Laws applicable to it. There are no material Governmental Orders
against or involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries owns, holds or possesses all material

3.10. Intellectual Property. Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list of all (a) registered or material
Intellectual Property owned by any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
and (b) material Intellectual Property that any of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries is licensed or otherwise permitted by other Persons to use. The
Company or a Company Subsidiary owns, or is licensed or otherwise permitted to
use, all material Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct
of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted in each case,
except as would not be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the Company, the use of any Intellectual
Property by any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries does not infringe
on or otherwise violate the rights of any Person, except as set forth on
Section 3.08(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no Person is infringing on or otherwise violating any right of any of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any material

business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) no such claims have
been asserted or threatened that have not been decided or settled by any of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with regard to Intellectual Property
owned by the Company, and (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no valid
basis for any such claims exists. No Intellectual Property owned by any of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that
would result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
Intellectual Property. All employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and all independent contractors who have contributed, developed
or conceived any material Intellectual Property used by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in or for the conduct of the business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted have done so pursuant to a
valid and enforceable agreement or other obligation that granted the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, sufficient ownership or

development or conception. The Company and Company Subsidiaries possess all
source code and other documentation and materials necessary to compile and
operate the products of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in all
material respects, and no such source code has been disclosed to any third
party. The Company and Company Subsidiaries are not under any obligation,
whether written or otherwise, to develop any Intellectual Property for any
third party (including any customer or end user). No product produced by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries has been used with, integrated with, or
distributed with any software that contains, or is derived in any manner (in
whole or in part) from, any public software that is distributed as open source
software (e.g., Linux) or similar licensing or distribution models. All
employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries and all independent
contractors who have contributed, developed or conceived any material
Intellectual Property or products produced by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries have done so pursuant to a valid and enforceable agreement or
other obligation that granted the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
as applicable, exclusive ownership of the employee or independent contractor's
contribution, development or conception. 3.11. Labor Matters.

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and for the prior two years

Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is party
to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor contract applicable to
any of its employees and none of the employees thereof are organized in any

Company and except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts or threats
thereof or material labor dispute by or with respect to any such employees.

pay practice or policy and (ii) as a result of or in connection with the
Closing or as a result of the termination by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries of any Persons employed by the Company or any of the Company

any liability that exists or arises under any of the Company's or any of the
Company Subsidiaries' benefit or severance policy, practice, agreement, plan,
program, Law applicable thereto, including severance pay, bonus compensation
or similar payment, or (B) to accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of or otherwise enhance any benefit due any Employee.

(c) To the Company's Knowledge, no executive, key employee or group of
employees of any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has any plans to
terminate employment with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No employee has the
right to terminate employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without
any subsequent action by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and receive a
severance payment or other material benefit in connection with such
termination of employment by the employee.

(d) Each employee classified as exempt by any Company or any Company
Subsidiary as of the date hereof is properly so classified under applicable
Law. For the past two years all individuals who have performed services for
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or who otherwise have claims for
compensation from the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been properly
classified as an employee or an independent contractor pursuant to all
applicable Laws, including, but not limited to, the Code and ERISA.

(e) The Company has provided the Purchaser with separate written disclosure
setting forth its good faith estimate of all payments including with respect
to transaction bonuses and on account of Shares and Options that employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will receive in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries maintains, contributes to or
has any obligation with respect to, any material employee benefit plan within
the meaning of Â§ 3(3) of ERISA (an "ERISA Plan"), or any other material
retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock bonus or deferred
compensation, severance, sick leave, employment, retention, compensation or
other material employee benefit plan, program or arrangement providing
benefits to current or former employees, officers or directors, in each case
whether or not terminated, of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(a "Non-ERISA Plan"); provided, however, that Section 3.12(a) does not
identify any International Plan (i) the existence of which is required by
applicable Law, or (ii) which is an employment, retention, severance,
consulting or similar agreement with any employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that provides for total annual compensation that is not
in excess of $200,000. All ERISA Plans and Non-ERISA Plans (collectively,
"Benefit Plans") are being maintained and operated in all material respects in
accordance with all Laws applicable to such plans and the terms and conditions
of the respective plan documents. The Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") has
issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each ERISA Plan (or,
in the case of an ERISA Plan that is based upon a prototype plan, an opinion
letter with respect to the underlying pre-approved plan) that is intended to
be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Â§401(a) of the Code and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that could adversely affect the
qualified status of such ERISA Plan. No ERISA Plan is subject to Title IV or
Â§302 of ERISA or Â§412 of the Code and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have no liability with respect to any such employee benefit plan or to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on behalf of any such employee benefit
plan. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
maintains or contributes to any employee benefit plan that is subject to Title
IV or Â§302 of ERISA or Â§412 of the Code. None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate contributes, has an obligation to contribute
to or has any liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan or a plan that
has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Â§4063 of ERISA, other than with respect
to an International Plan. Except as required by applicable non-U.S. law or as
set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and except
for continuation coverage as required by Â§4980B of the Code, Section 601 et
seq. of ERISA or by applicable state insurance or non-U.S. Laws ("COBRA"), no
Benefit Plan provides life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to
current or former employees, officers or directors or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof after termination of employment. The Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material respects
with the requirements of COBRA.

(b) With respect to all Benefit Plans, other than International Plans the
existence of which is required by applicable Law, the Company has delivered to
the Purchaser, to the extent applicable, correct and complete copies of the
current plan documents and summary plan descriptions, the most recent
determination or opinion letter received from the IRS, the three most recent
Form 5500 Annual Reports filed with the U.S. Department of Labor and all
accompanying schedules, and all related trust agreements, insurance contracts
and other funding arrangements that implement each Benefit Plan and all
material correspondence regarding any Benefit Plan with the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of Labor or the IRS in the two (2)
prior years. (c) All material contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions, if any) and premium payments that are
due have been made within the time period prescribed by applicable law to each
Benefit Plan or have been accrued in accordance with GAAP and Company past
practice.

(d) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any trustee or administrator of any such ERISA Plan, has engaged
in any transaction with respect to such ERISA Plan that would subject the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to either a material civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Â§502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by Â§4975 of the Code. No actions, suits,
claims or proceedings with respect to the assets of any Benefit Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by or before any Authority. No fiduciary (as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA) that is the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any
employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other Person that is a fiduciary of any ERISA Plan, has any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the investment or
administration of the assets of any ERISA Plan (including any liability under
an indemnification agreement) which is reasonably likely to result in a
material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule separately identifies
each Benefit Plan that: (i) is maintained in whole or in part outside the
United States; (ii) is subject to Laws of a jurisdiction other than the United
States or a political subdivision thereof; or (iii) is maintained for the
benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens (an
"International Plan"), other than those International Plans the existence of
which is required by applicable Law, and other than employment, retention,
severance, consulting or similar agreements with any employee of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries that provide for total annual compensation
that is not in excess of $200,000. Each International Plan has complied in all
material respects with all requirements that it register with an applicable
Authority, and has been maintained in good standing with all applicable
Authorities. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will directly or
indirectly result in any payment made or to be made by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary prior to Closing to or on behalf of any person to
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no obligation to "gross
up" any current or former employee, officer or director for any excise taxes
or other taxes relating to any excess parachute payment under Section 280G and
4999 of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no material unfunded liability with respect to
any International Plan.

(f) Except as would not result in a material liability to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, all deferred compensation plans, programs and arrangements
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries which are subject to the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code are in material compliance, both in
form and operation, with Section 409A of the Code and all guidance issued
thereunder. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no obligation to
"gross up" any current or former employee, officer or director for any excise
taxes under Section 409A of the Code. (g) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary may terminate any Benefit
Plan, other than an International Plan, in accordance with its terms, without
the consent of any other Person without material liability to the Company. To
the Knowledge of the Company, other than in the ordinary course of business or
as required by Law or any Benefit Plan, the Company has not promised any
increase in benefits under any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date.

(h) This Section 3.12, Section 3.13, Section 3.11 and Section 3.08 contain the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company with respect
to any employee matters, including any arising under ERISA.

obligations other than: (a) liabilities and obligations set forth in the
Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statement, including any notes
thereto; (b) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the date of the Interim Financial Statement; and (c)
liabilities to perform under the terms of agreements to which the Company
and/or one or more Company Subsidiaries are party.

3.21. Product Warranty; Product Liability. To the Knowledge of the Company,
neither Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material liability (and
there is no basis for any present or future action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand against any of them giving
rise to any liability) for replacement or repair thereof or other damages,
liability or obligations in connection therewith, in excess of the reserve for
warranty claims set forth in the Interim Financial Statement as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past
custom and practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and which are
in accordance with GAAP. Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, to the Company's Knowledge, an accurate, correct and
complete list and summary description of all existing material claims asserted
in writing against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries arising from or
alleged to arise from any injury to person or property as a result of the

date hereof. Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes copies
of the standard terms and conditions of service, sale or lease for the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (containing applicable guaranty, warranty and
indemnity provisions). To the Company's Knowledge, no product or service sold,
leased, or delivered by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is subject to
any material guaranty, warranty, or other indemnity that fails to conform in
all material respects (and in a manner that is materially adverse to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), with the applicable standard terms and
conditions of sale or lease set forth in Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, except for any guaranty, warranty or other indemnity that
is imposed by law.

REPRESENTATIVES, AND ANY SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING

The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following actions
between the date hereof and the Closing, and thereafter to the extent
provided:

6.01. Investigation.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to reasonable restrictions imposed from
time to time upon advice of counsel in respect of applicable Laws relating to
the confidentiality of information (including any antitrust or competition
Laws), each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Closing, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall make available to the Purchaser all
such information concerning the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries'
businesses, properties and personnel as the Purchaser may reasonably request
and shall instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors and auditors to
cooperate in connection with the foregoing; provided, however, that (x) the
activities of the Purchaser and its representatives shall be conducted in such
a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (y) in no event will
the Company or any Company Subsidiary be required to furnish the Purchaser or
its representatives with any documents or information that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is required by Law, order, judgment, injunction,
stipulation, award or decree of any Authority, or agreement entered into in
the ordinary course of business to keep confidential, or that would reasonably
be expected to jeopardize the status of such document or information as
privileged, work product or as a trade secret. The Company shall keep the
Purchaser reasonably informed with respect to the implementation of the ERP
system in its European operations, including providing the Purchaser with
reasonable notice of any material and adverse developments with respect
thereto.

(b) The parties shall schedule and coordinate all inspections pursuant to
Section 6.01(a) and the Purchaser shall give the Company at least two (2)
Business Days' prior notice thereof, setting forth the inspection or materials
that the Purchaser or its representatives intend to conduct. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld, none of the Purchaser or its
representatives shall contact any suppliers to, customers of, or employees,
directors or managers, as applicable, of, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of this
Agreement.

6.02. Further Actions. Each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver
such documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, including the
proviso set forth below in this paragraph, each of the parties hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts under the circumstances to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing and
subject to the proviso set forth below in this paragraph, the parties hereto
shall cooperate in using their reasonable best efforts promptly (a) to effect
all registrations and filings with, and to obtain all consents, amendments,
permits or other actions from, any Person required to be made or obtained by
the terms of this Agreement or otherwise necessary or desirable for the due
and punctual consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) to
fulfill all conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all of the
consents set forth in Section 3.04(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, that in connection with obtaining any such consents or any
other consents, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Sellers
or the Purchaser shall be required to incur any out-of-pocket costs or any
other obligation or liability unless de minimis in nature. The Purchaser
agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
in order to help to obtain any such third-party consents.

6.03. Conduct of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries Prior to the
Closing. Unless the Purchaser shall otherwise agree in writing, or except as
provided in Section 6.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise
expressly contemplated by or permitted by this Agreement, during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Closing the Company shall, and it shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to: (x) conduct its business in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice, (y) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization
and advantageous business relationships and retain the services of its key
officers and key employees and (z) take no action that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay its ability to
obtain any necessary approvals of any Authority required for the transactions
contemplated hereby or to perform its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Closing, except as set forth in Section 6.03 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and except as expressly contemplated or permitted
by this Agreement, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), affirmatively take any of the

subsection (c)(ii) thereof):

(a) adjust, split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or other
equity interests, as applicable;

(b) make, declare or pay any non-cash dividend, or make any other non-cash

available cash on hand;

(c) directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares
of its capital stock or other equity interests, as applicable, or any
securities or obligations convertible (whether currently convertible or
convertible only after the passage of time or the occurrence of certain events) into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock or other
equity interests, as applicable;

grant any Person any right to acquire any equity interest in it;

case existing as of the date hereof, or by applicable Law, enter into an

salaries, or incentive compensation or incentive compensation opportunities of
any past, present or future employee or consultant of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or, except for payments required by the terms of any
Benefit Plan or agreements, in each case existing as of the date hereof, pay
or provide, or increase or accelerate the accrual rate, vesting or timing of
payment or funding of, any compensation, benefits or other rights of any
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary;

(g) except as required by applicable Law or the terms of any Benefit Plan as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, establish, adopt, or become a party
to any new employee benefit or compensation plan, program, commitment or
agreement or amend or terminate any Benefit Plan;

amount of its properties or assets;

securities, contributions to capital, property transfers, merger or purchase
of all or any significant portion of the property or assets of any other
individual, corporation or other entity, other than in the ordinary course of
business;

(j) implement or adopt any material change in its tax accounting or financial
accounting principles, practices or methods, other than as may be required by
applicable Law, GAAP or regulatory guidelines;

(k) make any material change in the policies of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to the payment of accounts payable or accrued expenses
or the collection of the accounts receivable or other receivables, including
any acceleration or deferral of the payment or collection thereof, as
applicable, in each case, other than in the ordinary course of business;

(l) enter into any contract which would have been a Material Contract if in

any business or line of business in any geographic area; or (n) agree to take or make any commitment to take any of the actions prohibited
by this Section 6.03.

6.04. Regulatory Filings.

(a) Each of the Purchaser and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to: (i) prepare, as soon as practicable (and in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof), all filings and other presentations in
connection with seeking any regulatory approval, exemption or other
authorization from any Authority necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) prosecute such filings and other presentations with
diligence; and (iii) oppose any objections to, appeals from or petitions to
reconsider or reopen any such approval by Persons not party to this Agreement.
Each of the Purchaser and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
facilitate obtaining any final order or orders approving such transactions
consistent with this Agreement and/or to remove any impediment to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
Purchaser and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to furnish or
cause to be furnished all information in connection with the approvals of or
filings with any Authority. Subject to Section 6.04(b), the Purchaser and the
Company will each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, and to remove any
impediment imposed by any Authority to allow the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Purchaser and the
Company will advise the other party promptly of any material communication
received by such party or any of its Affiliates from the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC"), the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), any state
attorney general or any other Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements
(oral or written) such party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the
DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Purchaser and the
Company will consult with the other in advance of any material meetings with
the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.04(a), each of the
Purchaser and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (which shall include therein a request for early
termination) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days, and thereafter make any other required submissions with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act, and shall take all
other actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable. Additionally, in furtherance and not in limitation of
Section 6.04(a), each of the Purchaser and the Company shall make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the GWB with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five
(5) Business Days, and thereafter make any other required submissions with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any such law or
regulation, and shall take all other actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods such law or regulation as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser shall not be required to
propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divesture or disposition of its assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses. However, the Parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the parties from
expeditiously closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.05. Confidentiality. Unless and until the transactions contemplated hereby
have been consummated, the Purchaser will, and will ensure that its
representatives and other agents will, hold in strict confidence and not use
in any way except in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, all confidential information obtained in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby from the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Sellers or any of their respective representatives, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and except as required by
Law, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Purchaser will, and will ensure that its representatives and other agents
will, hold in strict confidence and not use in any way all confidential
information regarding the Sellers (but not relating to the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the business conducted thereby) obtained in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. The covenants contained in this
Section 6.05 are independent covenants and shall be enforceable by each
disclosing party regardless of any claims that any non-disclosing party shall
have against the disclosing party or any of such disclosing party's
Affiliates, whether under this Agreement or otherwise.

6.06. Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, the Company, each Seller and the Seller
Representative shall not take, nor shall they permit any of their Affiliates,
officers, directors, executive employees, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action
to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person
(other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, or in the case of providing
information or negotiating on Purchaser's behalf, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors, financing
sources, attorneys, accountants and other agents) concerning any purchase of
any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries' equity securities or any
merger, sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business or similar
transaction involving or relating to any Company or any Company Subsidiary,
other than the exercise of outstanding options and other than assets sold in
the ordinary course of business (each such transaction, an "Acquisition
Transaction"), and the Company, each Seller and the Seller Representative, and
their Affiliates, officers, directors, executive employees, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other agents,
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
negotiations and other communications with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any such Acquisition Transaction. During the period from the
date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
notify Purchaser promptly upon the receipt (but not the terms) of any proposal
or offer from any Person in respect of the foregoing. 6.07. Notice of Developments. If the Company or the Sellers become aware prior
to Closing of any event, fact or condition or nonoccurrence of any event, fact
or condition that may constitute a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company or the Sellers or may constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company or the Sellers if such
representation or warranty were made on the date of the occurrence or
discovery of such event, fact or condition or on the Closing Date, then the
Company or the Seller Representative will promptly provide the Purchaser with
a written description of such fact or condition. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, the Company and the Seller Representative shall
have the continuing obligation to promptly supplement the information
contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Sellers Disclosure Schedule
with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered, which, if in
existence on the date hereof and known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. Neither the supplementation of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
the obligation in this Section 6.07 nor any disclosure after the date hereof
of the untruth of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement shall
operate as a cure of the failure to disclose the information, or a cure of the
breach of any representation or warranty made herein, but such supplementation
or disclosure shall not give Purchaser the right to terminate this Agreement
unless the subject matter with respect thereto would reasonably be expected to
result in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Sections 7.01(a) or
7.01(c); and determination of any liability for breach of representations or
warranties either at signing or at Closing shall be made without reference to
any supplements and with reference only to the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Sellers Disclosure Schedule as they stand on the date of this Agreement;
provided, that if Purchaser determines to consummate the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby and not terminate this Agreement following
supplementation or disclosure of a fact, event, circumstance or condition (or
the nonexistence thereof) that has resulted in a failure to satisfy the
condition set forth in Sections 7.01(a) or 7.01(c), then the Sellers shall
have no indemnification or contribution obligations with respect to such fact,
event, circumstance or condition (or the nonexistence thereof), whether under
this Agreement or otherwise.

6.08. Section 280G. Prior to the Closing Date, (a) the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain a written waiver from each "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code)
who is entitled to receive payments or other benefits that may constitute
"parachute payments" for purposes of Section 280G of the Code of his or her
right to such payments or other benefits to the extent that they exceed one
dollar less than three times such individual's "base amount," as defined in
Section 280g(b)(3)(a) of the Code, if such payments or other benefits are not
approved by the Stockholders as described in clause (b) below (the "280G
Waivers"), and (b) the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
requisite Stockholder approval of any and all such payments and other benefits
such that, upon obtaining such Stockholder approval, such payments and other
benefits will not constitute "parachute payments" for purposes of Section 280G
of the Code (the "280G Approval"). The form of waiver and solicitation
materials, including all disclosure materials related thereto, shall be
prepared by the Company and approved by Purchaser, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

6.09. Additional Stockholders. From and after the date hereof, the Company and
the Seller Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
each of the Stockholders of the Company who are not a party hereto (each, an "Additional Stockholder"), to
execute as soon as practicable after the date hereof a joinder to this
Agreement agreeing to all of the terms hereof applicable to a "Seller"
hereunder, other than with respect to obligations set forth in Section 8.08
and Section 8.09, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Additional
Stockholder Joinder"). Within two (2) Business Days after the date hereof, the
Seller Representative shall exercise its rights as the Drag-Along Seller (as
defined in the Securityholders Agreement) under the terms of the
Securityholders Agreement to (i) require that 100% of the Common Stock owned
by the Additional Stockholders be sold to the Purchaser on the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) cause such Additional
Stockholders to execute and deliver the Additional Stockholder Joinder, and
upon such execution and delivery thereof such Additional Stockholder shall
constitute a "Seller" for all purposes hereunder, with the same force and
effect as if originally named as a Seller herein. The Seller Representative
shall take all actions required of the Drag-Along Seller under the terms of
the Securityholders Agreement in connection with the Drag-Along Right (as
defined in the Securityholders Agreement) and shall promptly provide the
Purchaser notice of any material objections raised by any such Additional
Stockholder. The execution and delivery of such Additional Stockholder Joinder
shall not require the consent of the Purchaser any other Seller hereunder. The
rights and obligations of each Seller hereunder shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the addition of any Additional Stockholder as a party
to this Agreement. In furtherance of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.09, the Seller Representative shall use its reasonable best efforts to
pursue through litigation a remedy, including injunctive relief, to cause the
Additional Stockholders to fully comply with their respective obligations
under the Securityholders Agreement and shall keep the Purchaser reasonably
and promptly apprised of any material developments relating thereto.

effect as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that
any representation or warranty is limited by its terms to a specific date or
range of dates (in which case such representation and warranty need only be

ARTICLE VIII 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



8.01. Publicity. Except as set forth below in this Section 8.01, no publicity
release or announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be made without advance written approval thereof
from the Purchaser and the Seller Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Purchaser and the Seller
Representative agree to cooperate in issuing any press release or other public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall each furnish to the other drafts of all such press
releases or announcements prior to their release. Nothing contained in this
Section 8.01 shall prevent (a) any party, upon the reasonable advice of
counsel, from furnishing at any time any information to any Authority or from
making any disclosures required under applicable Law, including the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or under the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange on which such party's shares of capital stock are
listed, (b) any party from furnishing any information concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby to such party's stockholders, Affiliates or
representatives who have a "need to know" such information and who agree to
treat such information on a confidential basis and as if they were parties to
the Confidentiality Agreement or (c) the Sellers from communicating with other
potential acquirers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that a
definitive agreement has been entered into so long as the identity of the
Purchaser and specific terms of this Agreement are not disclosed.

8.02. Business Records. The Purchaser acknowledges that the business records
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to their respective
operations prior to the Closing will be acquired by the Purchaser in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that the Sellers may from time to time require access to or copies of such
records in order to prepare Tax Returns, or to prepare for or respond to any
claim, action or proceeding, whether instituted, threatened or notified, to
which the Sellers are subject. The Purchaser agrees that upon reasonable prior
notice from any Seller, it will, during normal business hours, provide or
cause to be provided to such Seller access to or copies of such records. The
Purchaser agrees that it will not (and will cause each of its Affiliates,
including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to), within six years
after the Closing Date, destroy any material business records of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries prepared prior to the Closing and, in any event,
will not destroy any such material business records without first notifying
the Seller Representative and affording the Seller Representative at least 90
days to remove or copy such records. Purchaser shall not be obligated to
provide the Sellers with access to any books or records (including personnel
files) pursuant to this Section 8.02 where such access would violate any Law.

8.03. Investigation and Reliance. The Purchaser acknowledges (a) that it and
its representatives have undertaken an independent investigation, examination,
analysis and verification of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
business, assets, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser's own estimate of the
value of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (b) that it
has had the opportunity to visit with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and the Seller Representative and meet with its and their respective
representatives to discuss the business and the assets, liabilities, financial
condition, cash flow and operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, (c) that all materials and information requested by the
Purchaser have been provided to the Purchaser to the Purchaser's reasonable
satisfaction and (d) that it has undertaken such due diligence (including a
review of the assets, liabilities, books, records and contracts of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) as the Purchaser deems adequate, including that
described above. The Purchaser is not relying on any statement, representation
or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the Sellers or the
Company or any of their Affiliates or representatives or the accuracy or
completeness of any information provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the
Purchaser or any of its representatives, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except to the extent specifically set forth in Article III, the
Purchaser is purchasing the Company and the Shares on an "as-is, where-is"
basis. The Purchaser further acknowledges that it shall have no claim against
the Company or the Sellers with respect to any estimates, projections or
forecasts, whether written or oral, made available to the Purchaser by the
Company (or the Company's agents, representatives or Affiliates) in any
confidential information memoranda, "data rooms", management presentations,
due diligence discussions or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall have no
entitlement thereto after the date hereof.

8.04. Exculpation and Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not
permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or
modify any provision in its Organizational Documents relating to exculpation
or indemnification of former officers, directors and managers, as applicable,
holding office prior to the Closing (unless required by Law) in any adverse
manner to such Persons, it being the intent of the parties that the officers,
directors and managers, as applicable, of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the greatest extent permitted under the
Laws of the jurisdictions of incorporation or organization of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. Any liability of, or amount paid by, the Purchaser,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 8.04 or
otherwise under the Organizational Documents of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, to, on behalf of or on account of a Person covered by this Section
8.04 shall be referred to as the "DandO Indemnity Amount."

(b) The Company has procured the provision of and fully paid for a six-year
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy (the "DandO Tail Insurance
Policy") in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date
covering each Person currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and in
amounts not materially less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof but in any event with policy limits not less than $5,000,000.
For the avoidance of doubt, the costs and expenses associated with such
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy shall be included in the
Company Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid prior to Closing.

(c) The obligations of the Purchaser under this Section 8.04 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to
whom this Section 8.04 applies without the consent of the affected Person (it
being expressly agreed that each such Person to whom this Section 8.04 applies
shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 8.04 each of whom may
enforce the provisions of this Section 8.04).

(d) In the event Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective successor
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the case
may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 8.04. 

8.05. Employees and Employee Benefit Arrangements.

(a) Following the Closing Date and for twelve (12) months thereafter, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide the employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (the "Covered Employees") with: (i) base pay at a
rate that is not less than the rate applicable immediately prior to the
Closing; and (ii) other compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements
and arrangements (except for defined benefit plans and equity compensation)
that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, as those provided by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. It is
expressly acknowledged that the obligations of the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiaries under their respective Benefit Plans will continue as obligations
of the Company and/or the applicable Company Subsidiary after the Closing
Date, and the Sellers shall have no continuing liability with respect thereto;
provided, that the foregoing does not limit any obligation of the Sellers
under Article IX with respect to a breach of any representation made by the
Company with respect to such Benefit Plans.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide the Covered
Employees with service credit for all periods of employment with the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date for purposes of: (i)
eligibility and vesting under any welfare benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates; and (ii) the level of benefits under any vacation, paid time
off or severance plan of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; provided,
that in no event shall such service crediting result in a duplication of
benefits and in no event shall such service be credited for the purposes of
benefit accrual under a U.S. defined benefit pension plan. For the avoidance
of doubt, all severance or termination liabilities that arise as a result of a
termination or constructive termination of an employee of the Company or of
any Company Subsidiary triggered solely as a result of the Transaction (i.e.,
any severance payable to an employee who has an immediate "walk right" upon
the Closing of the Transaction, without any other condition) shall be deemed a
Company Transaction Expense; provided, however, that any severance or
termination liabilities arising from a termination or constructive termination
resulting from any action taken by the Purchaser and its Affiliates on or
following the Closing Date shall not be deemed a Company Transaction Expense.

(c) After the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any medical or dental benefit plans of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their
eligible dependents to the extent such limitations, waiting periods or
physical examinations were met, not required to be met, or waived under the
analogous Benefit Plans, and any deductibles and co-pays paid under any of the
Company's or any of the Company Subsidiaries' health plans shall be credited
towards deductibles and co-pays under the health plans of the Purchaser and
its Affiliates following the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, to the extent such deductibles and co-pays were credited under
analogous Benefit Plans. The Purchaser and its Affiliates may choose to keep
current welfare Benefit Plans in place through the end of the calendar year.

(d) A group health plan or plans of the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be
solely responsible for complying with the requirements of COBRA for (i) any
individual who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in QandA-4 of Treas.
Reg. Â§54.4980B-9 in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (ii) for any other individual who, as of the date of this
Agreement, is receiving or eligible for COBRA coverage under any group health
plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section
8.05 shall create any third party beneficiary right in any Person, and no
provision in this Agreement shall create any right to employment or continued
employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the
Purchaser, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this
Section 8.05 or any other provision of this Agreement: (i) shall be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan or program,
agreement; or (ii) limit the ability of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Company) to amend, modify or terminate
any benefit plan, program or agreement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 8.05 creates an obligation for the Purchaser to continue to
employ any Person.

8.06. Agreements Relating to Taxes.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall (severally, but not
jointly, as set forth in Article IX) indemnify the Purchaser, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, and their respective Affiliates harmless from and
against any Loss attributable to Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date
for any taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date
(each such taxable period shall be referred to as a "Pre-Closing Tax Period")
including, for this purpose, any Taxes that would be payable by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period but for deductions
that were taken into account in the calculation of the Income Tax Benefit
Amount, to the extent such Taxes and Losses exceed the amount, if any, taken
into account in determining Closing Net Working Capital and provided that any
rights for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.06(a) shall survive for
4 years after the Closing Date and any indemnification (other than, in the
case of such indemnification, with respect to income Taxes payable in respect
of income recognized by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period from January 1, 2012 to the Closing Date) shall be subject
to the limitation of Section 9.02(b)(iii).

(b) In order to apportion any Taxes relating to any Straddle Period, the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, services or
transactions (including, income, sales, use, transfer, withholding, payroll
and other employment Taxes) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of any
other Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period
that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period up to and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
Straddle Period. (c) All Tax refunds (or credits in lieu of Tax refunds) of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be for the account
of the Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or
credit (net of any expenses, including Taxes attributable to such refund or
credit) within 30 days after receipt or entitlement thereto; provided, that
Sellers shall not be entitled to any such refund or credit to the extent (i)
such refund or credit was taken into account in determining Closing Net
Working Capital, (ii) such refund or credit is attributable to the carryback
of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries from a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date, or (iii) such refund or credit is received after 4 years from
the Closing Date.

(d) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of Company
Subsidiaries filed after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to
be prepared, and file or cause to be filed (except as otherwise required by
Law, in a manner consistent with past practices) with the appropriate taxing
authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall (i) provide such Tax Returns to the Seller Representative for
its review and comment 30 days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns in the
case of income Tax Returns and 10 days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns
as in the case of all other Tax Returns and (ii) accept and incorporate in
such Tax Returns all reasonable comments made by the Seller Representative;
provided further, that with respect to any income Tax Returns of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2011 that
are not filed as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not be required to
provide such income Tax Returns to the Seller Representative for its review
and comment any earlier than 14 days prior to the filing of such income Tax
Returns.

(e) Tax Claims.

(i) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 8.06(a) then the
Purchaser shall give notice to the indemnifying party in writing of such claim
and of any counterclaim the Purchaser proposes to assert (a "Tax Claim");
provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Sellers have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure;

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than a Straddle Period) for which the Seller Representative has acknowledged
in writing the indemnification obligations of the Sellers for any Taxes
ultimately found to be owing with respect thereto, Sellers may elect to
control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the
foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund
suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however,
that the Purchaser, and counsel of its own choosing, shall have the right to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax
Claim if it reasonably determines that such Tax Claim could have an adverse impact on the Taxes of the Purchaser, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after
the Closing Date; and

(iii) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall jointly control and participate in
all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, and shall bear
their own respective costs and expenses. Neither the Sellers nor the
Purchasers shall settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(f) The Seller Representative, the Company, each of Company's Subsidiaries and
the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives to
reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes,
including by maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of
any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such
Tax Claim.

(g) The Purchaser shall not amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the written consent of the Seller Representative, if such
amendment could result in an increase in any indemnification obligation of the
Sellers pursuant to Section 8.06(a) or Section 9.02.

(h) For purposes of this Section 8.06, the Sellers' indemnification
obligations with respect to Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Sellers' entitlement to Tax refunds (or
credit in lieu of Tax refunds) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be calculated without regard to deductions
to be taken into account in the computation of the Income Tax Benefit Amount.

8.07. Confidentiality. Each Seller agrees not to disclose or use any
Confidential Information, except that if and as long as a Seller is an
employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries such Seller may use the
Confidential Information in the ordinary course of his employment on behalf of
the Company or such Company Subsidiary so long as such use is in compliance
with all policies and agreements applicable to such Seller. Upon termination
of such employment, each Seller will deliver promptly to Purchaser or destroy,
at the request and option of Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and all
copies) of the Confidential Information that are in his possession. In the
event that any Seller is requested or required pursuant to written or oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigation demand, or similar process to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller will notify Purchaser
promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 8.07. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, any Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt, such Seller may disclose the Confidential Information to the
tribunal; provided, however, that the disclosing Seller shall use such
Seller's reasonable best efforts to obtain, at the request of Purchaser, an
order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as Purchaser shall designate. The
foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information that is
(i) generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of
disclosure unless such Confidential Information is so available due to the
actions of a Seller, or (ii) included in materials prepared by Seller
Representative's Parent and its Affiliates, or the Other Institutional Sellers
and their respective Affiliates, for delivery to investors and prospective
investors.

8.08. Covenant Not to Compete. During the Restricted Period, each of the
Seller Representative, the Seller Representative's Parent and each of the
Restrictive Covenant Individual Parties will not, directly or indirectly, in
any manner (whether on such Seller's or Seller Representative's Parent's own
account, or as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director,
employee, investor, agent or otherwise), anywhere in the Applicable Area,
engage directly or indirectly in the Business as conducted as of the Closing
Date, or own any interest in, manage, control, participate in (whether as an
owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director, employee, investor,
agent, representative or otherwise), or consult with or render services for
any Person that is engaged in the Business as conducted as of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that no owner of less than 5% of the outstanding
stock of any publicly traded corporation shall be deemed to be engaged in the
Business solely by reason of such publicly traded corporation's engagement in
its business.

8.09. Covenant Not to Solicit. During the Restricted Period, each of the
Seller Representative, the Seller Representative's Parent and each of the
Restrictive Covenant Individual Parties will not, directly or indirectly, in
any manner (whether on such Seller's or Seller Representative's Parent's own
account, as an owner, operator, manager, consultant, officer, director,
employee, investor, agent or otherwise), (a) call upon, solicit or provide
services to any Customer with the intent of selling or attempting to sell any
products or services similar to those offered by the Business as conducted as
of the Closing Date, (b) hire or engage or recruit, solicit or otherwise
attempt to employ or engage or enter into any business relationship with any
Person employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or induce
or attempt to induce any Person to leave such employment (provided, that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to any Person outside the Restrictive
Covenant Individual Parties who responds to a general advertisement for
employment), (c) make any negative or disparaging statements or communications
regarding the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
operations, officers, directors or investors to any employee, network,
Customer, sales representative, broker, supplier, licensee or other business
relation (or any prospective customer, supplier, licensee or other business
relationship) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (d)
recommend any senior executive of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries.

8.10. Enforcement. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of Section 8.08 or Section 8.09 is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closer to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. In the
event of litigation involving Section 8.08 or Section 8.09, each party shall
bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such
litigation, including any appeal therefrom. The existence of any claim or
cause of action by any Seller against the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Affiliates, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Purchaser of the provisions of
Section 8.08 or Section 8.09, which Section will be enforceable
notwithstanding the existence of any breach by the Purchaser or the Company.

8.11. Release. If and only if the Closing occurs, each Seller and the Seller
Representative's Parent, for itself, and its heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasors"), hereby forever fully
and irrevocably releases and discharges Purchaser, the Company, each of or the
Company Subsidiaries, and each of their respective predecessors, successors,
direct or indirect subsidiaries and past and present stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, and other representatives
(collectively, the "Released Parties") from any and all actions, suits,
claims, demands, debts, agreements, obligations, promises, judgments, or
liabilities of any kind whatsoever in law or equity and causes of action of
every kind and nature, or otherwise (including, claims for damages, costs,
expense, and attorneys', brokers' and accountants fees and expenses) arising
out of or related to events, facts, conditions or circumstances existing or
arising prior to the Closing Date, which the Releasors can, shall or may have
against the Released Parties, whether known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, unanticipated as well as anticipated (collectively, the "Released
Claims"), and hereby irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or indirectly
asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced) any
suit, action, or proceeding of any kind, in any court or before any tribunal,
against any Released Party based upon any Released Claim. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence of this Section 8.11, "Released Claims" does not include,
and the provisions of this Section 8.11 shall not release or otherwise
diminish, (a) the obligations of any Party set forth in or arising under any
provisions of this Agreement or the agreements contemplated in connection
herewith, (b) if such Seller is an employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, in respect of (i) the current year's accrued but unpaid
compensation and (ii) such employee's outstanding benefits under the benefit
plans of the Company as of the Closing Date, and (c) the rights of any Person
under the DandO Tail Insurance Policy.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

9.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made by the parties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
until the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that (x) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.08 (Tax Matters) shall
survive the Closing until the four (4) year anniversary of the Closing Date,
at which time they automatically shall expire; (y) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.01 (Organization; Subsidiaries), Section
3.02 (Capitalization), Section 3.03 (Power and Authority; Effect of
Agreement), Section 3.18 (No Finder), Section 4.01 (Organization), Section
4.02 (Power and Authority), Section 4.04 (Ownership of Shares), Section 5.01
(Organization) and Section 5.02 (Power and Authority) shall survive the
Closing for five (5) years after the Closing Date, at which time they automatically shall expire; and (z) any claim
related to intentional or fraudulent breaches of the representations and
warranties may be made at any time prior to the five (5) year anniversary of
the Closing Date. Except for the covenants and agreements for which a period
of survival is specified in this Agreement, all covenants and agreements of
the parties herein shall survive the Closing until fully performed. Any claims
under this Agreement with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty
must be asserted by a written notice on or before the expiration of the
applicable survival period for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, and if such a notice is given, the survival period for such
representation or warranty shall continue solely as to the specific matters
subject to the claim asserted until it is fully resolved as provided herein.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge that,
notwithstanding the survival periods specified in this Section 9.01, the
representations and warranties made hereunder, are being made for purposes of
this Article IX immediately prior to the Closing.

9.02. Indemnification by the Sellers.

(a) General. Subject to the provisions of this Article IX and to the
limitations set forth in Section 6.07 hereof, each of the Sellers (for
purposes of Section 9.02, the "Indemnifying Party") agree (severally, but not
jointly, based on each Seller's percentage ownership of the Shares (the
"Seller's Pro Rata Share")) to indemnify the Purchaser or any of its officers,
directors, shareholders, Affiliates, agents or representatives and, after the
Closing, the Company (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees"), and hold the
Purchaser Indemnitees harmless from and against, any and all Losses resulting
from or incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, such Persons, with respect
to or by reason of:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in Article III hereof or such Seller in Article IV hereof or in any
agreement, document or certificate delivered to the Purchaser by such Seller
or the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Company (prior to Closing) or by such Seller under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and

(iii) any Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expense not paid prior to
Closing.

(b) Dollar Thresholds for Indemnification. For purposes of determining those
Losses that will be subject to indemnification under this Section 9.02, the
Purchaser and the Sellers have agreed to use predictable dollar thresholds as
provided in this Section 9.02(b):

(i) the Sellers shall not be liable to the Purchaser for any claim under
Section 9.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations or
with respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation) if the total Losses
suffered by the Purchaser with respect to such claim do not exceed $50,000
("Minor Claims"), it being understood that multiple claims arising from a
single set of facts or occurrence shall be aggregated for purposes of
determining whether or not they constitute a "Minor Claim"; (ii) the Sellers shall not be liable to the Purchaser for any claims under
Section 9.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations or
with respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation) unless and until the
total Losses suffered by the Purchaser with respect to all claims under
Section 9.02(a)(i) exceeds an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the amount
set forth in Section 2.02(a), excluding Losses with respect to Minor Claims,
and then only to the extent of such excess;

(iii) the maximum total amount payable by the Sellers under Section 9.02(a)(i)
(other than with respect to Fundamental Representations or with respect to the
fraud or intentional misrepresentation) with respect to all such Losses shall
not exceed an amount equal to seven percent (7%) of the amount set forth in
Section 2.02(a); and

(iv) the maximum total amount payable by the Sellers under Section 9.02(a)(i)
with respect to any Fundamental Representation or under Section 9.02(a)(iii)
with respect to all such Losses shall not exceed such Seller's Pro Rata share
multiplied by the aggregate amount determined in accordance with Section 2.02.

9.03. Indemnification by the Purchaser. Subject to the provisions of this
Article IX, the Purchaser (for purposes of Section 9.03, the "Indemnifying
Party") agrees to indemnify the Sellers and hold the Sellers harmless (and,
for purposes of this Article IX, the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Sellers are
collectively referred to as the "Indemnified Parties", and each, an
"Indemnified Party") from and against, any and all Losses resulting from or
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Sellers, with respect to or by
reason of:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchaser in this Agreement or in any agreement, document or certificate
delivered to the Sellers by the Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Purchaser under this Agreement.

9.04. Procedures for Indemnification. If an Indemnified Party shall claim to
have suffered a Loss for which indemnification is available under Section 9.02
or Section 9.03, as the case may be, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim which written notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of such claim, the facts and
circumstances that give rise to such claim and the amount of such claim if
reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made (or if not then
reasonably ascertainable, the maximum amount of such claim reasonably
estimated by the Indemnified Party). In the event that within thirty (30) days
after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such a written notice from the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall not have received from the
Indemnifying Party a written objection to such claim, such claim shall be
conclusively presumed and considered to have been assented to and approved by
the Indemnifying Party following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a
written notice from the Indemnified Party to such effect.

9.05. Procedures for Third-Party Claims.

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
in respect of any claim by any third party (each a "Third-Party Claim") shall
give the Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought (i)
prompt written notice (but in no event more than ten (10) days after the
Indemnified Party acquires knowledge thereof) of such Third-Party Claim and
(ii) copies of all documents and information received with respect to such
Third-Party Claim within ten (10) days of their being obtained by the
Indemnified Party; provided, that the failure by the Indemnified Party to so
notify or provide copies to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party for any
liability hereunder except to the extent that such failure shall have
materially and actually prejudiced the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, and expense,
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party
Claim with respect to which it is the Indemnifying Party and to be represented
by counsel of its own choice, and the Indemnified Party will not admit any
liability with respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge the
same without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party is contesting or
defending the same with reasonable diligence and in good faith or (ii) the
third party claim involves only money damages and does not seek a material
injunction or other equitable relief; provided, that the Indemnified Party may
participate in any proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense;
provided further, that the Indemnifying Party may not enter into a settlement
of any such Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such settlement
requires no more than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is
fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or involves other matters not
binding upon the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the
Indemnified Party's notice of the claim hereunder that it elects to undertake
the defense thereof or if the Indemnifying Party is not or is no longer
entitled to assume the defense thereof pursuant to this Section 9.05(b), the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, subject at all times to the
Indemnified Party's obligations under Section 9.06 hereof, to contest, settle
or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party shall control
the defense of any such claim, the Indemnifying Party will keep the
Indemnified Party apprised of all material developments, including settlement
offers, with respect to the claim.

9.06. Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party must take and must cause their
respective Affiliates to take commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
Losses to the extent reasonably possible upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses, including
without limitation at the Indemnifying Party's reasonable request and at the
cost of the Indemnifying Party using commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
and obtain recoveries from third parties other than the Indemnifying Party
hereunder (including, without limitation, any insurance company or other
insurance provider) who are legally responsible to reimburse such Indemnified
Party for any Losses. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the amount of any Losses of any Person under this Article IX shall
be net of the amount, if any, received by the Indemnified Party from any third
party less any costs incurred in pursuing such claims not reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party, including without limitation, any insurance company or
other insurance provider, and shall be net of the amount of any Tax benefit,
in each case in respect of or attributable to the Losses suffered thereby
(each, a "Third Party Reimbursement"). If, after receipt by the Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder, such Indemnified Party receives a Third Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses for
which indemnification was made and such Third Party Reimbursement was not
taken into account in assessing the amount of indemnification, then the
Indemnified Party shall turn over all of such Third Party Reimbursement to the
Indemnifying Party less any costs not reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as
set forth above up to the amount of the indemnification paid pursuant hereto.
In addition, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain, following the
Closing, insurance coverage reasonably appropriate to its business activities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 9.06 shall not apply to proceeds
recoverable by the Indemnified Parties under any insurance policy that is
purchased by the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to cover breaches or
liabilities arising under this Agreement.

9.07. Tax Treatment of Indemnification. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

9.08. No Duplication of Recovery; Losses. Any liability for indemnification
under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. For
purposes of this Article IX, "Losses" shall mean all losses, liabilities,
costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) actually
incurred or paid by an Indemnified Party, net of (i) any insurance proceeds
which such Indemnified Party has received relating to such Loss (net of any
costs associated with obtaining recovery from the related insurer) and (ii)
any Tax benefits which such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates has
realized (by way of a Tax refund or an actual reduction in cash Taxes
otherwise payable, in the case of the Purchaser, as certified by its Vice
President-Taxes) as a result of the facts giving rise to such Loss; provided,
"Losses" shall not include any loss, liability, damage or expense to the
extent relating directly or indirectly to any item included in the computation
of Closing Net Working Capital (all of which such losses, liabilities, damages
and expenses, to the extent then known, shall be addressed and resolved
exclusively in accordance with Section 2.07); provided further, that, the
parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of
fraud, "Losses" shall not include (other than with respect to Third Party
Claims), and no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of
this Agreement, for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or
indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue,
profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to
the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.

9.09. Exclusive Remedy After the Closing. OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE, THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IX AND SECTION
8.06 ARE THE PARTIES' SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AFTER THE CLOSING RELATING IN
ANY WAY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY OR CONTRIBUTION, WHETHER
CREATED BY LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY WAIVED; PROVIDED, THAT THE FOREGOING
SHALL NOT PROHIBIT A PARTY FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE OR OTHER EQUITABLE REMEDIES. 

9.10. Other Indemnification Matters. For purposes of determining whether there
has been any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or warranty, and
for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or
referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all material respects",
"Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded,
it being the understanding of the Parties that for purposes of determining the
amount of Losses under this Article IX, the representations and warranties of
the Parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and
phrases were not included in them.

ARTICLE X


TERMINATION

10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative;

(b) by the Purchaser by giving written notice to the Seller Representative at
any time (i) if the Sellers or the Company has breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement in a manner that
has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Purchaser has notified the Seller Representative of the breach and the breach
has continued uncured for a period of 15 days after the notice of breach or
(ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30, 2012
(the "Initial Outside Date") by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under Section 7.01 or if any such condition becomes impossible to
fulfill (in each case, unless the failure or impossibility results primarily
from the Purchaser breaching any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement); provided, that if the Initial Outside
Date shall occur at a time when the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are under review by the FTC, the DOJ, any state attorney general or
any other Authority under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law
that may be asserted by any United States or non-United States governmental
antitrust authority or any other party, then the Initial Outside Date shall be
extended by an additional 90 days (as extended, the "Extended Outside Date");
or

(c) by the Seller Representative by giving written notice to the Purchaser at
any time (i) if the Purchaser has breached any material representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement in a manner that
has had a material adverse effect on the ability of the Purchaser to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller Representative has
notified the Purchaser of the breach and the breach has continued uncured for
a period of 15 days after the notice of breach, or (ii) if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before the Initial Outside Date by reason of the
failure of any condition precedent under Section 7.02 or if any such condition
becomes impossible to fulfill (in each case, unless the failure or
impossibility results primarily from the Sellers or the Company breaching any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement);
provided, that if the Initial Outside Date shall occur at a time when the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are under review by the FTC, the
DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Authority under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
United States or non-United States governmental antitrust authority or any
other party, then the Initial Outside Date shall be extended until the
Extended Outside Date.

10.02. Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01 shall terminate all obligations of the parties hereunder,
without liability of any party to any other party (except for the liability of
any party then in willful breach), except (a) for the obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement (which shall survive in accordance with the terms
thereof), and for obligations under Section 8.01, this Section 10.02 and
Section 11.01 and Section 11.08 and (b) the parties shall only be liable for
any willful breach of this Agreement or any agreement made as of the date
hereof or subsequent thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.01. Seller Representative.

(a) The Seller Representative is hereby constituted and appointed as agent and
attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each of the other Sellers. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller Representative has full
power and authority, on behalf of each Seller and his, her or its successors
and assigns, to (i) interpret the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the documents to be executed and delivered by the Sellers in connection
herewith, (ii) execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be given
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) receive service of process in connection with any claims
under this Agreement, (iv) agree to, negotiate and enter into settlements and
compromises of claims, assume the defense of claims, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, (v) give
and receive notices and communications, (vi) take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, in connection with this Agreement, (vii) make any determinations and
settle any matters in connection with the adjustments to the Purchase Price in
Section 2.07, (viii) engage such counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants as the Seller Representative shall deem necessary in connection
with exercising the powers granted hereunder and shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons, and (xi) deduct,
hold back and/or redirect any funds that may be payable to any Seller pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or any agreements or documents executed and
delivered in connection herewith in order to pay, or establish a reserve for,
(i) any amount that may be payable by such Seller hereunder or (ii) any costs,
fees, expenses and other liabilities incurred by the Seller Representative (in
its capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement or its rights or
obligations hereunder.

(b) Such agency may be changed by Cetus from time to time upon not less than
five (5) days prior written notice to the Purchaser. The Seller
Representative, or any successor hereafter appointed, may resign at any time
by written notice to the Purchaser. A successor Seller Representative will be
named by Cetus. All power, authority, rights and privileges conferred in this Agreement to the Seller Representative will apply to any
successor Seller Representative.

(c) The Seller Representative will not be liable for any act done or omitted
under this Agreement as Seller Representative while acting in good faith, and
any act taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Purchaser agrees that it will not
look to the personal assets of the Seller Representative, acting in such
capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the
Company (pre-Closing) or the Sellers. In performing any of its duties under
this Agreement or any agreements or documents executed and delivered in
connection herewith, the Seller Representative will not be liable to the
Sellers for any Losses that such Person may incur as a result of any act, or
failure to act, by the Seller Representative under this Agreement or any
agreements or documents executed and delivered in connection herewith, and the
Seller Representative will be indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers for
all Losses, except to the extent that the actions or omissions of the Seller
Representative were taken or omitted not in good faith. The Seller
Representative will at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Sellers representing a majority of the Shares and Options,
collectively. The limitation of liability provisions of this Section 11.01(c)
will survive the resignation of the Seller Representative.

11.02. Notices. All notices, demands and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing or by facsimile, and shall be deemed to have been duly given if

dated April 9, 2012, between Robert W. Baird and Co., as agent of the Company,
and the Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, both written and oral, among the parties hereto
with respect thereto.

11.04. Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by the Seller Representative, the Company and the
Purchaser, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

11.05. Benefits; Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Except as set forth below, neither
this Agreement nor the obligations of any party hereunder shall be assignable
or transferable by such party without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; provided, however, that the Purchaser and, after the Closing,
the Company shall each have the right to assign any of its rights under this
Agreement (i) to any of its Affiliates so long as such party remains liable
for such Affiliate's or purchaser's obligations hereunder and (ii) as
collateral security purposes to any lenders providing financing to the
Purchaser, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary.

11.06. No Third-Party Beneficiary. Except as provided in Section 8.04, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers, or their respective
successors, heirs, personal representatives or permitted assigns, any rights
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

11.07. Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that
the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction.

11.08. Expenses. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have incurred certain of the costs and expenses
of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) such costs and expenses shall be included in the
Company Transaction Expenses and shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining the Aggregate Purchase Price payable at the Closing pursuant to
Section 2.02 (and shall be paid by the Company, or the Purchaser on behalf of
the Company, at the Closing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, all Transfer Taxes shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the
Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers.

11.09. Counterparts and Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by the several parties hereto in separate counterparts,
and delivered by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, each of
which shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument and an original
document.

11.10. Remedies Cumulative. No remedy made available by any of the provisions
of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each
and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.

11.11. Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of
the State of New York, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction
that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State
of New York (other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations
Law).

11.12. Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by
the other party or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in
any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The
City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any
appropriate New York State or federal court), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties
further agrees to accept service of process in any manner permitted by such
courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure lawfully to serve process, (b) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

11.13. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, in any appropriate New York State or federal court), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties further hereby waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

11.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

11.15. Currency. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "U.S.$" in this
Agreement refer to United States Dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

11.16. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to this
Agreement to any other party under this Agreement, which obligation is
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

11.17. Disclosure Schedules. A disclosure made by the Company or the Sellers
in any section of this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule (or subparts
thereof) or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof), as the case
may be, that reasonably informs the Purchaser of information with respect to
another section of this Agreement or any other section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof) in order to avoid a
misrepresentation thereunder shall be deemed, for all purposes of this
Agreement, to have been made with respect to all such other sections of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof), as the case may be,
notwithstanding any cross-references (which are included solely as a matter of
convenience) or lack of a schedule reference. Information reflected in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule is not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be. Such additional information is set forth for informational
purposes and does not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.
Disclosure of such additional information shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed and
disclosure of such information shall not be deemed to enlarge or enhance any
of the representations or warranties in this Agreement or otherwise alter in
any way the terms of this Agreement. Inclusion of information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be,
shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the business, assets, liabilities, financial
position, operations or results of operations of the Company and/or the
Company Subsidiaries.

11.18. Seller Representative's Parent. For purposes hereof, all obligations of
the Seller Representative (including in its capacity as a Seller) shall be
deemed to be obligations of the Seller Representative's Parent, including to
the extent that the Seller Representative is also a Seller hereunder, for
which the Seller Representative and the Seller Representative's Parent shall
be jointly and severally liable.

11.19. Interpretation. Meanings specified in this Agreement shall be
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders, as the context
requires and the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

11.20. Legal Representation. The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company) acknowledges and agrees
that Bingham McCutchen LLP ("Bingham") may have acted as counsel for Cetus,
the Company and their respective Affiliates in certain matters for several
years and that Cetus reasonably anticipates that Bingham will continue to
represent it and/or such other parties (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) in future matters. Accordingly, the Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company)
expressly: (a) consents to Bingham's representation of Cetus and/or its
Affiliates in any post-Closing matter in which the interests of the Purchaser
and the Company, on the one hand, and Cetus or its Affiliates, on the other
hand, are adverse, including, without limitation, any matter relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute
relating thereto and (b) consents to the disclosure by Bingham to Cetus or its
Affiliates of any information learned by Bingham in the course of its
representation of Cetus, the Company or their respective Affiliates.
Furthermore, the Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company) irrevocably waives any right it may have to
discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the representation
of Cetus and/or its Affiliates by Bingham in the transactions contemplated
hereby, to the extent that such information or documentation was privileged as
to Cetus and/or its Affiliates. Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall
cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Bingham, unless and to the
extent Bingham is specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent
the Company after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict
of interest with respect to Cetus and/or its Affiliates or Cetus and/or its
Affiliates, as applicable, consent in writing at the time to such engagement.
Any such representation of the Company by Bingham after the Closing shall not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

 Schedule 1


Calculation of Net Working Capital

The following accounting principles apply to the preparation and determination
of Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to Article II of the Agreement. All
terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the Agreement.

For purposes of calculating Closing Net Working Capital, the included accounts
shall be determined in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the accounts included on the Company's TM1 consolidation system
included on Annex A for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the other
accounting procedures described herein; provided, that any calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital shall (i) be based solely on the facts and
circumstances as they exist on or prior to the Closing and (ii) need not
contain footnote disclosures. For further clarification, if alternative
methodologies exist for calculating asset and liability balances for the
included accounts, the methodology utilized in the preparation of the accounts
included for the year ended December 31, 2011, as shown on Annex A*, shall be
employed. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall preclude the
addition of any additional accounts to those set forth on Annex A that would
have ordinarily been recorded under year end accounting policies (other than
items that would be recorded as a result of subsequent events).

*Omitted. The Company hereby agrees to provide the Commission, upon request, copies of any omitted exhibits or schedules to this exhibit required by Item 601 (b)(2) of Regulation S-K.
