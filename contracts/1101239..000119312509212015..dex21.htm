ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01. _The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place: (i) unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the
Company, via an electronic closing in which separate counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument, will first be delivered by a facsimile or
electronic mail exchange of signature pages, with originals to follow by
reputable overnight courier addressed to each partys counsel and (ii) as soon
as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date
the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, at such other time or on
such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. If the parties
deem a physical closing to be necessary, it shall take place at the offices of
Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, CA 94025.



 

9 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time:

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.02, Section 2.04 and
Section 2.05, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into (i) 0.19409 shares of Parent Stock,
(ii) $19.06 in cash, without interest or (iii) a combination of Parent Stock
and cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), the consideration
into which such share shall be converted being determined as set forth below
in this Section 2.02. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, including any cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Stock pursuant to Section 2.07, and the right to
receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in
each case to be paid or issued in accordance with Section 2.03, without
interest.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock (other
than shares in a Company Employee Plan) or owned by Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting Parent and the
Company shall prepare a form (an "Election Form") pursuant to which a holder
of shares of Company Stock may specify the number of such shares owned by such
holder that the holder desires to be converted into a right to receive cash
in the Merger and the number of such shares that the holder desires to be
converted into a right to receive shares of Parent Stock in the Merger. The
Company shall cause an Election Form to be included with the Company Proxy 



 

10  Statement and mailed to each holder of shares of Company Stock as of the
record date for such meeting.

(e) Each holder of shares of Company Stock (other than holders of such shares
that, in accordance with this Section, are to be canceled in the Merger and
holders of Dissenting Shares) shall have the right to specify in an Election
Form the number of such shares owned by such holder that the holder desires to
have converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger (a "Cash
Election") and the number of such shares that the holder desires to have
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Stock in the Merger (a
"Stock Election"). A Cash Election or a Stock Election shall be effective only
if the Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined) shall have received no later
than 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting (the "Election Deadline") an Election Form covering the shares of
Company Stock to which such Cash Election and/or Stock Election applies,
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions set forth in such
Election Form. A Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked or changed
only by delivering to the Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a
written notice of revocation or, in the case of a change, a properly
completed revised Election Form that identifies the shares of Company Stock to
which such revised Election Form applies. Delivery to the Exchange Agent prior
to the Election Deadline of a revised Election Form with respect to any
shares of Company Stock shall result in the revocation of all prior Election
Forms with respect to such shares of Company Stock. Any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article 10 shall result in the revocation of all
Election Forms delivered to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of such
termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Electing Shares" means all
shares of Company Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and shares of Company
Stock that are to be canceled in the Merger) as to which neither an effective
Cash Election nor an effective Stock Election has been made as of the Election
Deadline.

(f) Parent and the Company shall have the right to make rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity
and effectiveness of Election Forms, the manner and extent to which Cash
Elections and Stock Elections are to be taken into account in making the
determinations required by this Section and the payment of the Merger
Consideration.

(g) As more fully set forth below, the number of shares of Company Stock to be
converted into cash in the Merger shall be equal as nearly as practicable to
20% of the total number of shares of Company Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time and the number of shares of Company Stock to be converted into
shares of Parent Stock in the Merger shall be equal as nearly as practicable
to 80% of the total number of shares of Company Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time, in each case excluding Appraised Shares.

(h) If the number of shares of Company Stock as to which an effective Cash
Election has been made exceeds 20% of the total number of Non-Dissenting 



 

11  Shares, then (x) each share as to which an effective Stock Election has been
made and each Non-Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive
0.19409 shares of Parent Stock and (y) each share as to which an effective
Cash Election has been made shall be converted into:

(A) an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying (1) $19.06
by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is 20% of the total number of shares
of Non-Dissenting Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of
shares of Company Stock as to which effective Cash Elections have been made;
and

(B) that number of shares (or fraction of a share) of Parent Stock determined
by multiplying (1) 0.19409 by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is $19.06
minus the amount of cash determined pursuant to clause (A) above, and the
denominator of which is $19.06. 

(i) If the number of shares of Company Stock as to which effective Stock
Elections are made exceeds 80% of the total number of Non-Dissenting Shares,
then (i) each share as to which an effective Cash Election has been made and
each Non-Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive $19.06 in
cash, without interest, and (ii) each share of Company Stock as to which an
effective Stock Election has been made shall be converted into:

(A) that number of shares (or fraction of a share) of Parent Stock determined
by multiplying (1) 0.19409 by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is 80% of
the total number of Non-Dissenting Shares, and the denominator of which is the
number of such shares as to which effective Stock Elections have been made;
and

(B) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (1) $19.06 minus (2) an
amount determined by multiplying the number of shares (or fraction of a share)
of Parent Stock determined pursuant to clause (A) above by a fraction, the
numerator of which is $19.06 and the denominator of which is 0.19409.

(j) If Section 2.02(h) is not applicable and the number of shares of Company
Stock as to which effective Stock Elections are made is less than or equal to
80% of the total number of Non-Dissenting Shares, then each share of Company
Stock covered by an effective Cash Election shall be converted into the right
to receive $19.06 in cash per share, without interest, each share of Company
Stock covered by an effective Stock Election shall be converted into the right
to receive 0.19409 shares of Parent Stock and the Non-Electing Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive 0.19409 shares of Parent Stock, until the
sum of 



 

12  the number of shares covered by an effective Stock Election and the number
of Non-Electing Shares converted into a right to receive Parent Stock equals
at least 80% of the total number of Non-Dissenting Shares, and thereafter
Non-Electing Shares will be converted into the right to receive $19.06 in cash
per share, without interest. The Exchange Agent shall determine by lot (or by
such other method as Parent may deem reasonable) which of the Non-Electing
Shares will be converted into a right to receive cash and which of the Non-
Electing Shares will be converted into a right to receive Parent Stock.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, after any other
adjustments are made pursuant to Section 2.02 and 2.06, the tax opinion of
Parents counsel referred to in Section 9.02(g) or the tax opinion of the
Companys counsel referred to in Section 9.03(b) cannot be rendered (as
reasonably determined by such counsel) as a result of the Merger potentially
failing to satisfy Section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Code, then the amount of
cash payable with respect to each share of Company Stock that would otherwise
receive cash pursuant to Section 2.02 (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
proportionately reduced (such shares "Cash Reduction Amount"), and the
number of shares of Parent Stock payable with respect to each such share of
Company Stock shall be increased by an amount equal to such shares Cash
Reduction Amount divided by the Average Closing Date Stock Price, to the
minimum extent necessary to enable such tax opinion to be rendered (such
determination to be made as of the Closing Date).

(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.02, the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to each share of Company Stock that is a
Dissenting Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and that fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal pursuant to
Delaware Law shall be:

(A) an amount in cash, without interest, determined by dividing (i) the total
amount of cash payable to holders of Non-Dissenting Shares at the Effective
Time (not including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of Company Stock),
after taking into account any adjustments, including pursuant to Section
2.02(k), by (ii) the total number of Non-Dissenting Shares; and

(B) that number of shares of Parent Stock determined by dividing (i)
the total number of shares of Parent Stock payable to holders of Non-
Dissenting Shares at the Effective Time (including fractional shares of
Company Stock), after taking into account any adjustments, by (ii) the total
number of Non-Dissenting Shares.

Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange
Agent") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging for
the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock
(the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the 



 

13  "Uncertificated Shares") and for the purpose of receiving Election Forms and
determining, in accordance with Section 2.02, the form of the Merger
Consideration to be received by each holder of Shares. No later than one
Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent the cash portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration. In addition,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Parent
Stock portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares and any cash required to be
paid in respect of fractional shares of Parent Stock pursuant to Section
2.07. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of
Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parents
option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock or is
otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, including any cash in lieu of any fractional share
of Parent Stock pursuant to Section 2.07, and the right to receive any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in each case to
be paid or issued in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest. 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange 



 

14  Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
2.

(e) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in respect of such shares without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock
two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 2.07, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section. Following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the
time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07
and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such
surrender with respect to such securities and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares._

(a) If, after the Effective Time, a holder of shares of Company Stock that
were Dissenting Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal pursuant to
Delaware Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.02(l). Except as provided in Section 2.02(l) and the
immediately preceding sentence, shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented 



 

15  thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. Appraised Shares shall be treated as provided in
Section 262 of Delaware Law.

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to direct
all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.05 _. Company Equity Awards._ (a) At the Effective Time, each
unexpired and unexercised outstanding option granted or issued under stock
incentive plans of the Company in effect on the date hereof (a "Company Stock
Option") shall be automatically converted into, and substituted with, an
option to purchase that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the number
of shares of Company Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (and
rounded down to the nearest whole share), with an exercise price per share
equal to the exercise price per share that existed under the corresponding
Company Stock Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio (and rounded up to
the nearest whole cent), and with the same vesting schedule (including any
accelerated vesting pursuant to the agreements listed in Section 4.17(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule) as was applicable under such Company Stock
Option immediately before the Effective Time. The "Option Exchange Ratio"
shall be equal to the quotient (rounded to five decimal points) obtained by
dividing the Per Share Merger Consideration by the closing price of Parent
Stock on Nasdaq on the Closing Date. For this purpose, "Per Share Merger
Consideration" means the quotient (rounded to five decimal points) obtained by
dividing (i) the value on the Closing Date of the aggregate Merger
Consideration (excluding any portion allocated to Dissenting Shares), with
the value of the Parent Stock portion of the Merger Consideration calculated
based on the closing price of Parent Stock on Nasdaq on the Closing Date, by
(ii) the total number of shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any Dissenting Shares). It
is intended that the foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a manner
satisfying the requirements of Sections 424(a) and 409A of the Code.

(b) Each award with respect to shares of Company Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Time granted pursuant to any employee stock or compensation plan or
arrangement which is subject to forfeiture risk that remains unvested as of
the Effective Time or restricted stock units (collectively, "Company
Restricted Stock Awards") shall be converted at the Effective Time into the
right (which may in the form of a unit) to receive a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio ("Parent Restricted Stock Awards"). The terms and conditions of the
Parent Restricted Stock Awards shall have the same vesting schedule (including
any accelerated 



 

16  vesting pursuant to the agreements listed on Section 4.17(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), with appropriate adjustments for performance-based
conditions, as the Company Restricted Stock Awards.

(c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this
Section 2.05, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock
as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.05. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
an appropriate form with respect to the shares of Parent Stock promptly
following the Effective Time and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such awards
remain outstanding.

Section 2.06 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of
options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company Stock
granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.07 _. Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder
of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result
of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such
aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing price
of Parent Stock on Nasdaq on the Closing Date by the fraction of a share of
Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

Section 2.08 _. Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and their respective agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
any of their respective agents, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the agent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.



 

17 Section 2.09 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent
shall direct the Exchange Agent to issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this Article 2.

Section 2.10 _. Tax Consequences._ For federal income tax purposes, the
Merger is intended to constitute a 368 Reorganization. The parties to this
Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

ARTICLE 3

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

Section 3.01 _. Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of
incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Law.

Section 3.02 _. Bylaws._ The bylaws of the Company in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Law.

Section 3.03 _. Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers
of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Section 11.05, except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document
filed after December 31, 2008 and before the date of this Agreement or as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants
to Parent that:

Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental 



 

18  licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry
on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing (or has active status) in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect.

Section 4.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital
stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(the "Company Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of equity).

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors
has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously
resolved, subject to Section 6.03(b), to recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation"). 

Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,
(ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of any Applicable Competition
Law, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the
1934 Act, and any other 



 

19  state or federal securities laws, (iv) compliance with any applicable
requirements of Nasdaq and (v) any actions or filings the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Section 4.04 _. Non-Contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) require any
consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default, under, or cause or permit the termination,

Section 6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) recommend

contemplated hereby by the Companys stockholders, (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, (iii) shall not
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and (iv) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the
Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting whether or not an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred.

Section 6.03 _. No Solicitation; Other Offers._ (a) _General Prohibitions_.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
or other agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,

to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that is seeking to make,
or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation (or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal or take any action or make any statement inconsistent
with the Company Board Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause
(iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) approve any
transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under,

is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in
this Section by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be a breach of this Section by the Company.



 

45 (b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to
the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders:

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Companys compliance with
Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
reasonably believes will lead to a Superior Proposal, (B) furnish to such
Third Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement (a
copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent)
with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the non-disclosure agreement dated July 14, 2009 between the
Company and Parent (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement"); _provided_ that (1) such
non-disclosure agreement may contain a less restrictive or no
standstill restriction, in which case the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to
omit such provision, as applicable, and (2) all such information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party) and (C) take any nonappealable, final
action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take;

(ii) following receipt of a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

(iii) in response to an Intervening Event, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change;

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) only if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or from making any
legally required disclosure to stockholders, with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is
consistent with this Section 6.03; _provided_ that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation 



 

46  Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action.

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall
have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall
continue to advise Parent on a current basis of the status and terms of any
discussions and negotiations with any Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any indication that a Third Party is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the
Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed,
on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours of the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations), of the
status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request,
and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide
to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any
oral communications addressing such matters). Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the Companys compliance with this Section 6.03(c).

(d) " _Last Look_ ". The Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal unless
(i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the
Company promptly notifies Parent in writing of its intention to do so,
attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such
Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third
party making the Superior Proposal, and (iii) Parent does not make, within
five Business Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer
that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal
during such five Business Day period and any amendment to the financial terms
or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
written notification from the Company and a new five Business Day period
under this Section 6.03(d)). The Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(iii) unless
(A) the Company notifies Parent, in writing at least five Business Days
before taking that action, of its intention to 



 

47  do so, attaching a reasonably detailed explanation of the facts underlying
the determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that an Intervening
Event has occurred and (B) during such five Business Day period, if requested
by Parent, the Company has engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need for an Adverse
Recommendation Change in light of the Intervening Event.

(e) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal on terms that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority
vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel (taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), are
more favorable and provide greater value to all the Companys stockholders
than as provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)), which the
Board of Directors of the Company determines is reasonably likely to be
consummated and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole
or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available
by the Board of Directors of the Company; _provided, however_ , that for
purposes of this definition, the references to "10%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

For purposes of this Agreement, an "Intervening Event" means a material fact,
event, change, development or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement) that was neither known nor
reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition Proposal);
_provided_ , however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances relating to Parent that would be
excluded from the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" pursuant to clauses
(i)(D) or (i)(F) thereof shall be deemed to constitute an Intervening Event
or considered in any determination of whether an Intervening Event has
occurred.

(f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

Section 6.04 _. Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Non-Disclosure Agreement,
the Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the
Companys offices, properties, books and records, (ii) furnish to Parent, its
counsel, financial 



 

48  advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and
operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request
and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives to cooperate with Parent in its
investigation. Any investigation by Parent pursuant to this Section shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

Section 6.05 _. Tax Matters._ From the date hereof until the Effective Time,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any
material Tax election, change any annual tax accounting period, adopt or
change any method of tax accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or
claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any closing agreement, surrender
any material Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender any right to claim a
material Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to
any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim
or assessment, or take or omit to take any other action outside of the
ordinary course of business, if such other action or omission would have the
effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. __ 

Section 6.06. _Company 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent
at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all 401(k)
plans sponsored or maintained by Company and shall provide Parent evidence
that each of the Companys 401(k) plans has been terminated pursuant to an
action by the Companys Board of Directors.

COVENANTS OF PARENT 

Section 7.01 _. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary._ Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.02 _. Voting of Shares._ Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption

Section 7.03 _. Director and Officer Liability._ Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:



 

49 (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether the claim is asserted
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof and
provide advancement of expenses to the same extent to which the relevant
Indemnified Person would be entitled to such advancement on the date hereof
under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under the Companys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as applicable;  _provided_ that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under Applicable Law. In the event of any Proceeding related to such acts or
omissions, the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate and be entitled to
participate in the defense of such matter.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies
and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to
the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies. If the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year,
which amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; and _provided further_ that if the 



 

50  aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

Section 7.04 _. Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, Parent shall (i) to the extent of the access provided prior to the
execution of this Agreement, give to the Company, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access
to Parents offices, properties, books and records, (ii) to the extent of the
information provided prior to the execution of this Agreement, furnish to the
Company, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other
information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) to the extent of
the investigations conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement,
instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives to cooperate with the Company in its investigation.
Any investigation by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be conducted
in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of Parent. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by Parent hereunder.

Section 7.05 _. Stock Exchange Listing._ Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as part of the
Merger Consideration to be listed on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance.

Section 7.06. _Employee Matters_. (a) As of and after the Effective Time,
Parent will give each of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue employment with Parent after the Effective Time (the "Continuing
Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries 



 

51  (and prior service with any predecessor corporation that is recognized by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and accrual of benefits under any Parent Employee Plans
(but not for purposes of benefits accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan), except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits
under a Company Employee Plan and a Parent Employee Plan. Solely for purposes
of this Section 7.06, the term "Parent Employee Plan" means any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or
oral plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance
benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses and severance
benefits (but excluding equity-based compensation plans and any contract,
offer letter or agreement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with or
addressed to an individual), for the benefit of, or relating to, the current
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and with respect to which eligibility
has not been frozen.

(b) Following the date hereof, Parent shall establish retention and
integration programs for employees of the Company consisting of a combination
of cash and Parent equity awards to be granted following the Effective Time,
such that Parent shall make payments of cash and grants of such Parent equity
awards with an aggregate value of approximately $1.7 million (such value,
with respect to equity awards, based on the value at the time of grant),
subject to the recipients satisfaction of applicable vesting criteria in such
awards. Parent shall determine in its sole discretion which employees of the
Company will be eligible to receive awards under this program as well as the
terms and timing of any payments and benefits.

(c) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this Section 7.06 with respect to employees
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement
and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or Parent
Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment
with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries, nor shall they require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement for any
employee or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any
such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and
Applicable Law.

Section 7.07 _. Acquisition of Capital Stock of the Company._ Parent shall not
acquire any capital stock of the Company prior to the Closing.

Section 7.08 _. Appointment of Parent Director._ Effective as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be appointed to the Parents Board of Directors
an individual designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to 



 

52  Parent. In addition, Parent shall nominate such individual for re-election
to Parents Board of Directors at its 2010 annual meeting of stockholders.

contemplated hereby, and (iv) promptly notify the other party of any fact,
circumstance, change or effect that could reasonably be expected to prevent

8.01 shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent
agree or offer to: (i) effect any divestiture of, or hold separate (including
by establishing a trust or otherwise), or agree to restrict its ownership or
