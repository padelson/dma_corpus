spouse, children or other dependents or beneficiaries of any such Person or
successor in interest to such Person, each of clause (I) and (II), to the
extent allocable to incidents, events, actions, omissions, exposures or
circumstances existing or occurring on or at any time prior to the Closing, or
(B) pursuant to any Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement established or maintained by Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate;

(vi) the Retained Environmental Liabilities;

(vii) the Excluded Claims Liabilities; and

(viii) any Objectionable Title and Survey Matter, to the extent (A) Seller
makes an election with respect thereto in accordance with clause (ii) of
Section 5.16(b) or (B) Seller is obligated to remove or rectify such matter
pursuant to clause (B) of Section 5.16(b).

Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller, for
itself and each of its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and releases Buyer and each of its Affiliates from all Excluded
Liabilities.

(e) The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Acquired
Assets and other rights under this Agreement shall be an amount equal to Nine
Hundred Million Dollars ($900,000,000) (the "Base Purchase Price"), which
shall be increased or decreased (in accordance with Section 2.2(a)) by (i) the
Capital Expenditures Adjustment and (ii) the PPA Termination Adjustment, and
shall be further subject to any adjustments for prorations pursuant to Section
2.4. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to (A) Seller the Base Purchase Price,
which shall be increased or decreased (in accordance with Section 2.2(a) or
Section 2.4(b), as applicable) by (I) the Estimated Capital Expenditures
Adjustment as determined pursuant to Section 2.2, and (II) the Estimated
Proration Adjustment Amount, as determined pursuant to Section 2.4, and (B)
PPL EPlus the Estimated PPA Termination Adjustment, as determined pursuant to
Section 2.2, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
U.S. Dollars to such account or accounts as specified by Seller or PPL EPlus,
as applicable, to Buyer in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing.

SECTION 2.2. Capital Expenditures Adjustment; PPA Termination Adjustment.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
deliver to Buyer a worksheet setting forth Seller\'s good faith reasonable
estimate of (A) the Capital 

Expenditures Adjustment as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Capital
Expenditures Adjustment") and (B) the PPA Termination Adjustment as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated PPA Termination Adjustment" and, together with
the Estimated Capital Expenditures Adjustment, each an "Estimated Adjustment
Amount"), together with reasonable detail and supporting material regarding
the computations thereof. If any Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased by an
amount equal to such Estimated Adjustment Amount. If any Estimated Adjustment
Amount is a negative number, the Base Purchase Price payable at the Closing
will be decreased by an amount equal to the absolute value of such Estimated
Adjustment Amount.

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Seller will prepare and deliver
to Buyer a computation (the "Adjustment Statement") of the actual PPA
Termination Adjustment as of the Closing Date (the "Actual PPA Termination
Adjustment") and the actual Capital Expenditures Adjustment as of the Closing
Date (the "Actual Capital Expenditures Adjustment" and, together with the
Actual PPA Termination Adjustment, the "Actual Adjustment Amount"), together
with reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the computations
thereof. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of such Adjustment
Statement, Buyer does not object in writing thereto to Seller, then the Actual
Capital Expenditures Adjustment and the Actual PPA Termination Adjustment
shall be as reflected on the Adjustment Statement.

(c) If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Adjustment Statement
Buyer objects to the Adjustment Statement to Seller in writing, then Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their
disagreement. Should such negotiations not result in an agreement within
twenty (20) days after receipt by Seller of such written objection from Buyer,
then the matter shall be submitted for resolution and determination to the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to
Buyer and Seller a written determination of such disputed Actual Adjustment
Amount (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Seller)
within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent
Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on
the Parties. In resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm
may not assign any value to a disputed item greater than the greatest value
claimed for such disputed item by any Party or lesser than the lowest value
claimed for such disputed item by any Party. All fees and expenses relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant
to this Section 2.2 will be allocated between Seller and Buyer in inverse
proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed
items so submitted (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm).

(d) If, following the determination of any Actual Adjustment Amount (as agreed
between the Parties or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm), the
related Estimated Adjustment Amount less such Actual Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, then Seller, or PPL EPlus, as applicable, shall be obligated
to pay Buyer a cash payment equal to such positive number. If the related
Estimated Adjustment Amount less such Actual Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then Buyer shall be obligated to pay Seller or PPL EPlus, as
applicable, a cash payment equal to the absolute value of such negative
number. Any such payment, together with interest thereon at the rate of five
percent (5%) per annum from the Closing Date through the date of payment, will
be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days after such Actual Adjustment 

Amount is finally determined as provided in this Section 2.2 and will be
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as shall be specified by Buyer, Seller or PPL EPlus, as applicable,
to the other Party in writing. The payments to be made pursuant to this
Section 2.2(d), if due and payable within the same ten (10)-Business Day
period, may be netted against each other. Any such payment will be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law.

(e) Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each
other and, if applicable, the Independent Accounting Firm, with reasonable
access to such books, records and employees as are reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation of the Adjustment Statement and the other
matters addressed in this Section 2.2.

SECTION 2.3. Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) Not later than 120 days after the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller with
an allocation of the Purchase Price, plus any liabilities deemed assumed for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, among the Acquired Assets as of the Closing
Date using the allocation method provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury regulations thereunder (the "Purchase Price Allocation"); provided,
however, that the Parties agree that the amount to be allocated to the Kerr
Plant shall be equal to the fixed amount set forth in Schedule 1.1(c), subject
to adjustment for any Kerr True-Up Amount actually paid pursuant to Section
5.18. The Purchase Price Allocation shall be subject to the consent of Seller,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Parties
shall cooperate to comply with all substantive and procedural requirements of
Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and except for any
adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Purchase Price Allocation shall be
adjusted only if and to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements.
Buyer and Seller agree that they will not take nor will they permit any
Affiliate to take, for Tax purposes, any position inconsistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation; provided, however, that (a) Buyer\'s cost may
differ from the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect, for example, the
inclusion in the total cost of items (such as capitalized acquisition costs)
not included in the total amount so allocated and (b) the amount realized by
Seller may differ from the amount allocated to reflect, for example,
transaction costs that reduce the amount realized for federal income Tax
purposes. Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, shall notify
Buyer or Seller, respectively, within twenty (20) days after notice or
commencement of an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the
allocation determined under this Section 2.3.

(b) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve any
disagreement with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation, provided that if
such negotiations do not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days after
Seller\'s receipt of the Purchase Price Allocation from Buyer, then the matter
shall be submitted for resolution and determination to the Independent
Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and
Seller a written determination of the disputed Purchase Price Allocation
within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent
Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on
the Parties. 

SECTION 2.4. Acquired Assets Proration.

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, with respect to the sale of the Acquired Assets, all of the items
listed in Schedule 2.4 (including any Prepayments with respect to such items)
(collectively, the "Prorated Items") relating to the Acquired Assets shall be
prorated as of the Closing in accordance with this Section 2.4. Schedule 2.4
also contains an example of the calculation of the proration of the real
property taxes and other Taxes attributable to the Acquired Assets.

(b) As of the date at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller will deliver to Buyer a worksheet setting forth (i) Seller\'s good
faith reasonable estimate of the Prorated Amount for each Prorated Item (with
respect to each Prorated Item, the "Estimated Prorated Amount"), as well as,
in each case, reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the
computation thereof, and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the Estimated
Prorated Amounts (the "Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount"). In the event
that, with respect to any Prorated Item, actual figures are not available as
of the time of the calculation of the Estimated Prorated Amount, the Estimated
Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item shall be a good faith reasonable
estimate, including (as applicable) based upon the actual fee, cost or amount
of the Prorated Item for the most recent preceding year (or appropriate
period) for which an actual fee, cost or amount paid is available. If the
Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Base Purchase
Price payable at Closing will be increased by an amount equal to such
Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated Proration Adjustment
Amount is a negative number, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will
be decreased by an amount equal to the absolute value of such Estimated
Proration Adjustment Amount.

(c) As soon as either Party obtains Knowledge of the actual Prorated Amount
with respect to any Prorated Item, it shall promptly notify the other Party of
such Prorated Item and actual Prorated Amount, together with reasonable detail
and supporting material regarding the computation thereof. For any Prorated
Item with respect to which the Estimated Prorated Amount is not equal to the
actual Prorated Amount, upon the request of either Seller or Buyer, made
within thirty (30) days of the date when such Party first obtained Knowledge
of the actual Prorated Amount with respect to such Prorated Item (the "Request
Date"), the Parties shall calculate (A) the Prorated Amount for such Prorated
Item using the actual available amounts (the "Actual Prorated Amount"), and
(B) the absolute value of the difference between the Estimated Prorated Amount
and the Actual Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item (the "Prorated
Difference"). If the Actual Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative
number) is greater than the Estimated Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a
negative number) for such Prorated Item, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to
the Prorated Difference to Seller within ten (10) days of the Request Date. If
the Estimated Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) is
greater than the Actual Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative
number) for such Prorated Item, Seller shall pay an amount equal to the
Prorated Difference to Buyer within ten (10) days of the Request Date. The
Parties shall furnish each other with such documents and other records as may
be reasonably requested in order to confirm all proration calculations made
pursuant to this Section 2.4.

(d) In the event any Party disagrees with the other Party on the computation
of the Actual Prorated Amount for any Prorated Item to be determined under
this Section 2.4, such Party may provide a written notice of the disagreement
to the other Party, and Buyer and Seller shall 

negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement. Should such
negotiations not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days after delivery
of such notice of disagreement, then the matter shall be submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to
Buyer and Seller a written determination of the Actual Prorated Amount and the
Prorated Difference with respect to the disputed item (such determination to
include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving
at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Seller) within thirty (30) days of
the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. In
resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign any
value to a disputed item greater than the greatest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party or lesser than the lowest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this
Section 2.4(d) will be allocated between Seller and Buyer in inverse
proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed
items so submitted (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm).

(e) If, after the Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any
payment with respect to the Acquired Assets relating to periods on or after
the Closing Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer within three (3) Business Days
after such receipt an amount equal to the amount received with respect to
periods on or after the Closing Date.

SECTION 2.5. Closing

assignment of the Assigned Contracts (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00

shall have no claim against Seller, its Affiliates or their respective

Entities from and against any and all Damages incurred by such Indemnified

Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and to periods ending prior to the
Closing Date, subject to Seller\'s obligation to keep such books, records,
files and documents confidential in accordance with Section 5.5(c), in order
to permit Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives to
prepare and file their Tax Returns and to prepare for and participate in any
investigation with respect thereto, to prepare for and participate in any
other investigation and defend any Claims relating to or involving Seller or
its Affiliates, to discharge its obligations under this Agreement, to comply
with financial reporting requirements, and for other reasonable purposes, and
will afford Seller and its Affiliates reasonable assistance in connection
therewith. Buyer will cause such records to be maintained for not less than
seven (7) years from the Closing Date and will not dispose of such records
without first offering in writing to deliver them to Seller; provided,
however, that in the event that Buyer transfers all or a portion of the
Acquired Assets or the Assigned Contracts to any third party during such
period, Buyer may transfer to such third party all or a portion of the books,
records, files and documents related thereto, provided such third-party
transferee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of Buyer under this
Section 5.1(f). 

(g) On and after the Closing Date, at the request of either Party, the other
Party shall make available to such requesting Party, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, those employees of the non-requesting Party
requested by such requesting Party in connection with any Claim, including to
provide testimony, to be deposed, to act as witnesses and to assist counsel;
provided, however, that (i) such access to such employees shall not
unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of the operations of the non-
requesting Party, (ii) the requesting Party shall pay and reimburse the non-
requesting Party for the out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by the non-
requesting Party in making such employees available to the requesting Party
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, and (iii) such
assistance shall be provided insofar as the same may be provided without (a)
violating any Law or Permit or (b) waiving any attorney-client privilege, as
determined in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the non-requesting Party.

(h) No later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall Make Available to Buyer all Assigned Contracts entered into by Seller on
or prior to the date of this Agreement.

accordance with their terms and in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Permits and Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, during the

Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to:

(i) (A) assign or terminate, or amend or waive any material term under, any

any other Assigned Contract or (B) enter into any new Contract that would be

Obligation or amendment, and at least twenty (20) days before Closing),
including any update to Schedule 5.4, along with copies of relevant documents
or instruments.

(d) Seller may take commercially reasonable actions that would otherwise be
prohibited pursuant to Section 5.2(a) in order to prevent the occurrence of or
mitigate the existence of an emergency situation involving endangerment of
life, human health, safety or the environment or the protection of equipment
or other assets; provided, however, that (i) Seller shall provide Buyer with
notice of such emergency situation and any such action taken by Seller as soon
as reasonably practicable, and (ii) nothing in this Section 5.2(d) shall be
deemed to waive any breach of violation by Seller of any representation or
warranty under this Agreement as a result of such action. 

(e) With respect to any Permits for which the date for renewal will have
passed by the Closing Date, Seller shall file by the Closing Date all
applications necessary to renew such Permits in a timely fashion without any

(f) During the Interim Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, notify Buyer of (and with respect to subparts (i) and (iii) Buyer shall
notify Seller of): (i) any Claim pending or, to Seller\'s Knowledge,

before any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that seeks a writ, judgment,
order, injunction or decree restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
any Claim settled by Seller, as permitted under Section 5.2(a)(xi), including

alleging any material violation of any material Permit (including any
Environmental Law) necessary for the ownership, operation or maintenance of
the Acquired Assets by Seller as currently conducted, (C) regarding any
pending or threatened proceeding to condemn or take by power of eminent domain
all or any part of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property or (D)

PPL EPlus) is in default under any Material Contract or Assigned Contract.

SECTION 5.3. Support Obligations.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, and each shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts, to terminate, or cause Buyer to be
substituted in all respects for Seller and any of Seller\'s Affiliates in
respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates under all
Support Obligations relating to Permits or Contracts assumed by Buyer as of
the Closing.

(b) Buyer agrees to (i) furnish letters of credit, (ii) deliver cash
collateral and (iii) assume Seller\'s obligation under guaranties, in each
case, in accordance with the credit support requirements of any Assigned
Contract pursuant to which a Support Obligation has been provided; provided
that, with respect to each such Support Obligation, Buyer shall not be
required under this Section 5.3(b) to deliver replacement credit support of
the same type as, or with terms and conditions substantially similar to, such
Support Obligation, provided the replacement credit support delivered by Buyer
complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable Assigned Contract or
is otherwise acceptable to the counterparty thereto.

(c) If Buyer and Seller are unable to obtain the full and unconditional
release of Seller from any Support Obligation as of the Closing pursuant to
Section 5.3(a) (each such Support Obligation, until such time as it is
released in accordance with Section 5.3(a), a "Continuing Support
Obligation"):

(i) from and after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall continue to
cooperate, and each shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts, to
obtain promptly the full and unconditional release of Seller or any of its 

Affiliates from each Continuing Support Obligation and evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller or such Affiliate of each such release; and

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and any of its Affiliates from and against
any liabilities, losses and reasonable costs or expenses (including any
issuance, amendment or maintenance fees and expenses) incurred by Seller and
any such Affiliate in connection with each Continuing Support Obligation
(including reimbursement immediately following demand therefor with respect to
any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Support
Obligation).

SECTION 5.4. Assigned Contracts.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent, from each party
(other than any of Seller or its Affiliates) (each a "Counterparty") to each
Assigned Contract, to the assignment and assumption of such Assigned Contract
at Closing in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(v) and Section 2.1(c)(i),
exclusively relating to such Assigned Contracts, held by or for the benefit of
Seller. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer\'s efforts shall include (i)
offering to replace any Support Obligations maintained by any Affiliate of
Seller in favor of any Counterparty in accordance with the requirements of
Section 5.3 and in the case of Assigned Contracts with respect to which
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has posted or maintains any Support
Obligation, Buyer shall comply with all requirements under any such Assigned
Contract to post or maintain credit support as security for the performance of
its obligations as assignee thereof, as required by Section 5.3, and (ii)
where indicated in Schedule 5.4, entering into a master agreement or similar
enabling agreement with any such Counterparty, on substantially the same terms
as those in place on the date hereof in a master or enabling agreement between
Seller and such Counterparty (as disclosed to Buyer prior to the date hereof),
in connection with the assignment to Buyer of one or more purchase orders or
similar Contracts that represent Assigned Contracts subject to such master
agreement or enabling agreement with Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
specifically acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that (A) neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be obligated to incur, pay, reimburse or provide or cause any of
their respective Affiliates to incur, pay, reimburse or provide, any
liability, compensation, consideration or charge to obtain the written consent
of any Counterparty to the assignment and assumption of any Assigned Contract
and (B) with respect to any Assigned Contracts to which Buyer is the
Counterparty, Buyer hereby consents to the assignment of such Assigned
Contracts by Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer.

(b) If Buyer and Seller are unable to obtain any required consent of a
Counterparty to the assignment of any Assigned Contract marked with an
asterisk on Schedule 2.1(a)(v) prior to the Closing, and if either of Buyer or
Seller has elected to waive the condition set forth in Section 6.1(g)(i) and
Section 6.2(g)(i), as applicable, with respect to such Assigned Contract, then
any such Assigned Contracts shall not be assigned at Closing (such non-
assigned Contracts, the "Non-Assigned Contracts"), and Buyer and Seller shall
continue to comply with their obligations under Section 5.4(a) to the extent
and for so long as the applicable Non-Assigned Contract shall not have been
assigned to Buyer, and Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (but, in no event, in contravention of any rights or obligations
pursuant to such Contract or otherwise in violation of Law) to enter into one
or more back-to-back Contracts that would (i) place Buyer in the same or a
substantially similar position (except in respect of any Excluded 

Liabilities) and (ii) provide Buyer the same or substantially similar rights,
privileges, liabilities, benefits and obligations, in each case, as if such
Non-Assigned Contract had been assigned to Buyer in accordance with Section
2.1(a)(v) as of the Closing.

(c) Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in providing such notices to
Counterparties as may be required by the terms of any Assigned Contracts or as
Buyer (acting reasonably) may deem necessary, including notices providing
Counterparties with updated notice information.

SECTION 5.5. Confidentiality; Publicity.

(a) No Party will issue any press release or similar public announcement or
public communication regarding this Agreement or the proposed transactions
contemplated hereunder, or any matter related to the foregoing, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except if such announcement or other communication is
required by applicable Law or Permit (including any rules of an applicable
securities exchange), in which case the disclosing Party shall, as permitted
by applicable Law or Permit, first allow the other Parties at least two (2)
Business Days to review such announcement or communication and the opportunity
to comment thereon; provided that approval shall not be required in respect of
any public announcement by a Party that is substantially similar in content to
any announcement previously approved by the other Party.

(b) The confidentiality provisions set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 10 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be incorporated herein, except
to the extent such provisions conflict with an express provision of this
Agreement, in which case the provision of this Agreement shall control, with
effect from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of (A) the Closing, or
(B) two (2) years from the date hereof.

(c) At the Closing, the Parties shall enter into the Post-Closing
Confidentiality Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit H. From and after the
Closing Date, the Post-Closing Confidentiality Agreement shall constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between
the Parties with respect to matters related to confidentiality.

(d) Notwithstanding clause (b) of this Section 5.5, Buyer shall be permitted
to disclose Confidential Information to any Governmental Entity as necessary
or desirable in order to obtain any Buyer Required Consent in accordance with
Section 5.7, and Buyer shall have no obligation to seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy in order to limit such disclosure; provided Buyer
shall provide Seller reasonable advance notice of any such proposed disclosure
in order to permit Seller to seek such a protective order or other appropriate
remedy. To the extent Seller elects to seek such a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, Seller shall bear all costs and other obligations with
respect thereto; provided Buyer agrees not to oppose any action by Seller to
obtain such protective order or other appropriate remedy in order to limit
such disclosure.

SECTION 5.6. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in
anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

Notwithstanding this immediately preceding sentence, each Party shall pay all
filing fees owed by it and required by Governmental Entities with respect to
Permits, except for filing fees in connection with filings under the HSR Act,
which shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

SECTION 5.7. Regulatory and Other Approvals.



(a) During the Interim Period, each Party will, in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
provide reasonable cooperation to the other Party, and proceed diligently and
in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts, as promptly as
practicable, to (i) obtain the Buyer Required Consents and the Seller Required
Consents, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Seller and Buyer, (ii) make all required filings with, and to give all
required notices to, the applicable Governmental Entities or other Persons
required to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, and (iii) cooperate in good faith with the
applicable Governmental Entities or other Persons and provide promptly such
other information and communications to such Governmental Entities or other
Persons as such Governmental Entities or other Persons may reasonably request
in connection therewith.

(b) During the Interim Period, the Parties will provide prompt notification to
each other when any Consent or Permit referred to in Section 5.7(a) is
obtained, taken, made, given or denied, as applicable. Each Party will
promptly inform the other Parties of any material communication received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity or other
Person from which any such Consent or Permit is required, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and will permit the other Party to review any material
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
material meeting or conference with, any such Governmental Entity, and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other Party the
opportunity to attend and to participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing covenants:

(i) Each of Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to (A) make an appropriate filing of a "Notification and Report Form" pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements within fifteen (15) days after the
earlier of (I) the date the MPSC notifies Buyer (pursuant to Section 69-8-421
of the Montana Code) that its application filed pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(ii)
is adequate and in compliance with the MPSC\'s minimum filing requirements or
(II) the expiration of the forty-five (45)-day period during which the MPSC is
required to deliver such notice, absent notification by the MPSC during such
period of any inadequacy in Buyer\'s filing (or such alternate period, as
mutually agreed by the Parties, as may be necessary or desirable to coordinate
filings and receipts of Permits, and avoid expiration of any Permit prior to
the Closing), (B) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
or documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, (C)
comply substantially with any additional requests for information, including
requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions, made by the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, the United States Federal Trade Commission or the 

or competition Law authorities of any other jurisdiction (the "Antitrust
Authorities") and (D) make as promptly as practicable any necessary or
appropriate subsequent or supplemental filings and cooperate in the
preparation of such filings as is reasonably necessary and appropriate.

(ii) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) within ninety
(90) days following the execution of this Agreement (or such alternate period,
as mutually agreed by the Parties, as may be necessary or desirable to
coordinate filings and receipts of Permits, and avoid expiration of any Permit
prior to the Closing), make an appropriate filing with the MPSC of all
documents reasonably required to obtain the MPSC Approvals and (B) supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information or documentary material
that may be requested by MPSC, and Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in connection therewith to obtain
the required Consent. Buyer shall consult with Seller on all principal filings
submitted by Buyer to the MPSC in connection with the MPSC Approvals; provided
that Buyer shall have no obligation to consult with Seller to the extent there
is insufficient time prior to the requested or required deadline for
submission of any such filing to MPSC; provided, further, Buyer shall not
enter into any agreement with the MPSC to accelerate any such requested
deadline without Seller\'s consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

(iii) Other than with respect to filings under the HSR Act or to the MPSC,
Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts, within ninety (90)
days following the execution of this Agreement (or such alternate period, as
mutually agreed by the Parties, as may be necessary or desirable to coordinate
filings and receipts of Permits, and avoid expiration of any Permit prior to
the Closing), prepare and file with each applicable Governmental Entity
requests for such Permits as may be necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
including the FERC Approvals. Buyer and Seller will diligently pursue and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Permits and will cooperate with
each other in seeking such Permits. To such end, the Parties agree to make
available the personnel and other resources of their respective organizations
in order to obtain all such Consents.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
obligated to provide Seller with proprietary information relating to Buyer\'s
business or any information that could reasonably be expected to result in a
violation of any Law or Contract or constitute waiver of any attorney client
privilege.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for
maintaining any applicable registrations with WECC or NERC in respect of the
Facilities, such that Seller shall have no responsibility and Buyer shall be
responsible, after the Closing Date for the compliance of the Facilities with
any applicable WECC or NERC standards during the period from and after the
Closing. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to deliver to WECC, prior
to the Closing Date and otherwise in accordance with WECC policy a
registration letter in the form of Exhibit J in furtherance of the changes to
the WECC registration required to reflect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Parties will advise WECC when the Closing Date has 

SECTION 5.8. Seller Marks. As soon as reasonably practicable but in no event
more than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall remove, cover
or conceal from the Facilities or the Acquired Assets any and all any names,
marks, trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos incorporating
"PPL" and any word or expression similar thereto or constituting an
abbreviation or extension thereof (collectively and together with all other
names, marks, trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos owned by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, the "Seller Marks"). Thereafter, Buyer shall
not use any Seller Mark or any name or term confusingly similar to any Seller
Mark in connection with the sale of any products or services, in the corporate
or doing business name of any of its Affiliates or otherwise in the conduct of
its or any of its Affiliates\' businesses or operations. In the event that
Buyer breaches this Section 5.8, Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance of this Section 5.8 and to injunctive relief against further
violations, as well as any other remedies at law or in equity available to
Seller; provided, however, that to the extent necessary Buyer may have up to
180 days after the Closing Date in order to remove from the Facilities and the
other Acquired Assets any and all Seller Marks.

SECTION 5.9. Casualty Losses.

(a) If any of the Acquired Assets are damaged or destroyed by casualty loss (a
"Casualty Loss") during the Interim Period, Seller shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after the occurrence of such Casualty Loss, notify Buyer of the
same and, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, deliver estimates of
(i) the cost of restoring such damaged or destroyed Acquired Assets
attributable to such Casualty Loss to a condition reasonably comparable to
their prior condition (such restoration costs, collectively, the "Restoration
Cost") and (ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds available to Seller or
its Affiliates therefor, which estimate shall be prepared by a qualified
engineering firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller.

(b) If such Restoration Cost is greater than $1,000,000 but does not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the Base Purchase Price, Seller shall repair or
replace such damaged or destroyed Acquired Assets, at Seller\'s expense, to a
condition reasonably comparable to their condition prior to such Casualty
Loss; provided, however, that if such repair or replacement cannot be
completed prior to the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Outside Date, either Party may elect to delay Closing until such repair or
replacement is reasonably complete (but not, without the other Party\'s
consent, beyond the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of this
Agreement); provided, further, that Buyer may, within ten (10) days of an
election by Seller to delay the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.9(b), elect
to reduce the amount of the Base Purchase Price by the estimated amount of the
remaining Restoration Cost agreed to by Seller and Buyer three (3) Business
Days prior to Closing less the amount of insurance proceeds actually received
by Seller in respect thereof. If Buyer elects the option pursuant to the
second proviso of the preceding sentence, any election to delay Closing
pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) shall be null and void and any insurance
proceeds received on or prior to the Closing Date on account of such Casualty
Loss shall be (A) paid directly to, or subsequently contributed to, Buyer at
Closing and (B) not, prior to Closing, used by Seller or its Affiliates to pay
any expense or distribution.

(c) If the Restoration Cost is in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the Base
Purchase Price, (i) either Party may, by notice to the other Party within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the determination of the
Restoration Cost, elect to terminate this Agreement or (ii) if neither 

Party exercises such right to terminate, Seller shall repair or replace such
damaged or destroyed Acquired Assets, at Seller\'s expense, to a condition
reasonably comparable to their condition prior to such Casualty Loss;
provided, however, that if such repair or replacement cannot be completed
prior to the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Outside Date,
either Party may elect to delay Closing until such repair or replacement is
reasonably complete (but not, without the other Party\'s consent, beyond the
date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of this Agreement); provided,
further, that Buyer may, within ten (10) days of an election by Seller to
delay the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.9(c), elect to reduce the amount
of the Base Purchase Price by the estimated amount of the remaining
Restoration Cost agreed to by Seller and Buyer three (3) Business Days prior
to Closing less the amount of insurance proceeds actually received by Seller
in respect thereof. If Buyer elects the option pursuant to the second proviso
of the preceding sentence, any election to delay Closing pursuant to this
Section 5.9(c) shall be null and void and any insurance proceeds received on
or prior to the Closing Date on account of such Casualty Loss shall be (A)
paid directly to, or subsequently contributed to, Buyer at Closing and (B)
not, prior to Closing, used by Seller or its Affiliates to pay any expense or
distribution.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Seller completes the repair or
replacement of damaged or destroyed Acquired Assets pursuant to this Section
5.9, and the cost of such repair is borne solely by Seller, Buyer shall have
no rights to any insurance proceeds related thereto and shall assign its
rights and claims to any insurance proceeds payable to Buyer as a result of
such Casualty Loss to Seller in order to provide Seller with the right to
pursue and receive such insurance proceeds.

SECTION 5.10. Condemnation.

(a) If any of the Acquired Assets are taken by condemnation, or are subject to
a pending condemnation proceeding, in each case, during the Interim Period,
Seller shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the occurrence of such
condemnation event or receipt of notice regarding such proceeding, notify
Buyer of such event or proceeding and as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter deliver estimates of (i) the condemnation value of such Acquired
Assets, individually or in the aggregate with other condemned Acquired Assets
(such value with respect to such Acquired Assets, the "Condemnation Value")
and (ii) the amount of any condemnation award proceeds paid or payable to
Seller or its Affiliates, which estimate shall be prepared by a qualified
valuation firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller; provided that, with
respect to any pending condemnation proceeding for which the Condemnation
Valuation is reasonably expected to be greater than $1,000,000, the Parties
shall not cause the Condemnation Value to be determined unless and until such
proceeding results in a binding Order of condemnation (and shall delay Closing
until such time, or such time as such proceeding is no longer pending, but in
no event without the Parties\' consent beyond the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the date of this Agreement).

(b) If such Condemnation Value is greater than $1,000,000 but does not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the Base Purchase Price, Seller shall replace the
Acquired Assets that are subject to the condemnation proceeding with
substantially similar Acquired Assets; provided, however, that if such
replacement cannot be effected to the date that is ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date, either Party may elect to delay Closing until such
replacement is complete (but not, without the other Party\'s consent, beyond
the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of this 

Agreement); provided, further, that Buyer may, within ten (10) days of an
election by Seller to delay the Closing pursuant to this Section 5.10(b),
elect to reduce the amount of the Base Purchase Price by the estimated amount
of the remaining Condemnation Value agreed to by Seller and Buyer three (3)
Business Days prior to Closing less the amount of condemnation award proceeds
actually received by Seller in respect thereof. If Buyer elects the option
pursuant to the second proviso of the preceding sentence, any election to
delay Closing pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) shall be null and void and any
condemnation award proceeds received on or prior to the Closing Date on
account of such condemnation event shall be (A) paid directly to, or
subsequently contributed to, Buyer at Closing and (B) not, prior to Closing,
used by Seller or its Affiliates to pay any expense or distribution.

(c) If the Condemnation Value is in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the
Base Purchase Price, (i) either Party may, by notice to the other Party within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the determination of the
Condemnation Value, elect to terminate this Agreement or (ii) if neither Party
exercises such right to terminate, Seller shall replace such condemned
Acquired Assets, at Seller\'s expense, with substantially similar Acquired
Assets; provided, however, that if such replacement cannot be effected prior
to the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Outside Date, either
Party may elect to delay Closing until such replacement is complete (but not,
without the other Party\'s consent, beyond the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the date of this Agreement); provided, further, that Buyer may,
within ten (10) days of an election by Seller to delay the Closing pursuant to
this Section 5.10(c), elect to reduce the amount of the Base Purchase Price by
the estimated amount of the remaining Condemnation Value agreed to by Seller
and Buyer three (3) Business Days prior to Closing less the amount of
condemnation award proceeds actually received by Seller in respect thereof. If
Buyer elects the option pursuant to the second proviso of the preceding
sentence, any election to delay Closing pursuant to this Section 5.10(c) shall
be null and void and any condemnation award proceeds received on or prior to
the Closing Date on account of such condemnation event shall be (A) paid
directly to, or subsequently contributed to, Buyer at Closing and (B) not,
prior to Closing, used by Seller or its Affiliates to pay any expense or
distribution.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Seller completes the replacement
of Acquired Assets pursuant to this Section 5.10, and the cost of such
replacement is borne solely by Seller, Buyer shall have no rights to any
condemnation award related thereto and shall assign its rights and claims to
any condemnation award payable to Buyer as a result of such condemnation event
to Seller in order to provide Seller with the right to pursue and receive any
such condemnation award.

SECTION 5.11. Insurance. Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained in
full force and effect the insurance policies described on Schedule 3.14(a) (or
comparable replacement coverage) throughout the Interim Period. Buyer shall be
solely responsible for providing insurance in respect of the Acquired Assets
and for any claims made in connection with such policies after the Closing
regardless of when the event or occurrence relating to any claim arose.

SECTION 5.12. Terminated Contracts and Transition Services.



(a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on Schedule 

Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and, solely with respect to
the Terminated PPAs, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such
actions as may be necessary to terminate or sever (in each case with
appropriate mutual releases substantially in the form attached as Exhibit I)
effective upon or before the Closing, (i) any services provided to any of the
Facilities or otherwise with respect to any other Acquired Asset by Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, including all Affiliate Services, other than any such
services provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) the
Contracts listed on Schedule 5.12(a) (the "Terminated Contracts"). On and
after the Closing, none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have any
further obligations or liabilities pursuant to the Terminated Contracts.

(b) Concurrently with the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Services
Provider to, enter into an agreement with Buyer to provide those services set
forth on Schedule 5.12(b) (which schedule may be amended by Buyer, upon its
reasonable request no later than 120 days after the date of this Agreement,
subject to Seller\'s written approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed)) at a price equal to the applicable
Transition Service Cost Percentage of cost (as allocated in accordance with
the same methodologies used for such allocations by Seller and its Affiliates
in accordance with past practice) and in accordance with the other terms and
conditions set forth thereon (such agreements, the "Transition Services
Agreement"). The Parties will agree upon any remaining terms and conditions of
the Transition Services Agreement in a commercially reasonable manner as soon
as practicable after the date hereof and in any event within 180 days of the
date hereof.

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a list of its proposed representatives to the joint transition team.
Seller will add its representatives to such team within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of Buyer\'s list. Such team will be responsible for preparing as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and using commercially
reasonable efforts to timely implement a transition plan which will identify
and describe substantially all of the various transition activities that the
Parties will cause to occur before and after the Closing and any other
transfer of control matters that any Party reasonably believes should be
addressed in such transition plan. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their representatives on such transition team to
cooperate in good faith and take all reasonable steps necessary to develop a
mutually acceptable transition plan no later than ninety (90) days after the
date of this Agreement.

SECTION 5.13. Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be shared equally by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
in timely making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of such Tax Laws.

SECTION 5.14. Employee, Labor and Benefits Matters.

(a) Offer of Employment. Within ninety (90) days following the execution of
this Agreement (or, in the case of an individual who becomes a Scheduled
Employee after the date of this Agreement, as soon as practicable following
the date on which such individual becomes a Scheduled Employee, but no earlier
than ninety (90) days following the execution of this Agreement), Buyer will
make an offer of employment to each Scheduled Employee for the same 

or a comparable position and, other than any such employee on long-term
disability or non-protected leave, reflecting terms consistent with this
Section 5.14 and with such offers to be contingent upon (i) the Scheduled
Employee remaining employed by Seller or its Affiliates until the Closing
Date, (ii) the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
and (iii) the Scheduled Employee actually commencing employment with Buyer on
or, with respect to any Scheduled Employee on protected leave as of the
Closing Date, within three (3) months following the Closing Date. Each
Scheduled Employee who accepts such offer and who actually commences
employment with Buyer effective upon the Closing Date (or, in the case of a
Scheduled Employee not actively at work on the Closing Date, within three (3)
months following the Closing Date) shall be referred to herein as a
"Transferred Employee"); provided that each Transferred Employee who does not
commence active employment with Buyer until after the Closing Date shall first
be considered a Transferred Employee on such day of active employment (each
respective Transferred Employee\'s first day of employment with Buyer, his
"Transfer Date").

(b) Union Employees. Buyer will (i) as soon as reasonably practicable and in
no event more than ten (10) Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement, serve notice on IBEW Local 44 (the "Union") that Buyer recognizes
the Union, as of Closing, as the collective bargaining representative for all
Transferred Employees who are represented by the Union (the "Union
Employees"), (ii) assume and honor all obligations under the Collective
Bargaining Agreement listed in Schedule 3.12(b) (the "CBA") that arise on or
after Closing, in accordance with Law during the remaining term of such
agreement, and (iii) with the agreement of the Union or as otherwise provided
by applicable Law, adopt, assume or replicate effective as of the Closing Date
any Benefit Plans required to be provided to the Union Employees under the
CBA. With respect to the Union Employees, the obligations of Buyer set forth
in this Section 5.14 shall be subject to the terms of the CBA and all
applicable labor and employment Law requirements. For the avoidance of doubt,
from and after the Closing Date, Buyer assumes full responsibility to provide
any severance or termination pay benefits that may be required to be provided
under the CBA or otherwise arising from Buyer\'s actions or omissions on or
after the Closing.

(c) Seller Plans. From and after his respective Transfer Date, no Transferred
Employee shall have any right to accrue any further benefits, nor any right to
continue as active participants under the Benefit Plans (except to the extent
required by COBRA, and except to the extent that any group medical, dental,
prescription drug or vision care benefits under any Benefit Plans continue to
be available, by their express terms, through the end of the calendar month in
which the Closing Date occurs).

(d) Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits; General. Effective on each
respective Transferred Employee\'s Transfer Date, and for a period of not less
than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide each
Transferred Employee who is not a Union Employee with (x) base salary and
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (y)
employee benefits (including without limitation retirement, severance,
employee relocation, savings, health, vision, dental, disability and life
insurance benefits, as well as vacation, time off, sick and holiday pay
programs) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

(e) Severance. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section
5.14(d), from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide severance pay
and benefits to each Transferred Employee whose employment terminates or is
terminated (for reasons other than for cause) on or during the twelve
(12)-month period following the Closing Date, which are no less favorable than
those set forth in the severance program listed on Schedule 5.14(e) (taking
into account subsequent increases in compensation and service); provided,
however, that a Transferred Employee who is covered by the CBA shall only have
those severance rights, if any, as set forth in the CBA. As a condition of any
such severance benefits, Buyer shall require that eligible employees shall be
required to execute (and not revoke) a general release of all claims against
Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates.

(f) Annual Cash Incentive. Without limiting the generality of the provisions
of Section 5.14(d), Buyer shall provide incentive plans, including target
incentive levels, to Transferred Employees who are not Union Employees which
are no less favorable than the incentive plans and target incentive levels in
place immediately prior to the Closing Date, from and after Closing and
through December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs. Seller shall retain and be responsible for a pro rata
portion of the annual cash incentive bonuses for Transferred Employees who are
not Union Employees in respect of the year in which the Closing occurs,
payable at the normal time such bonuses are paid, based on actual performance
for the full year.

(g) Service Credit. With respect to any incentive, compensation or employee
benefit arrangements as may be maintained by Buyer for the Transferred
Employees, or in which the Transferred Employees are enrolled or participate,
from time to time following the Closing Date, service by such Transferred
Employees performed for Seller or any ERISA Affiliate (or a predecessor to
either such entity\'s business or assets) shall be treated as service with
Buyer, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and,
for purposes of plans or policies providing severance benefits, vacation
entitlement, and sick pay, benefit accruals, in each case to the extent
recognized for such respective purposes immediately before his respective
Transfer Date under any comparable type of Benefit Plan; provided, however,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits.

(h) Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations.

(i) Buyer agrees to waive any waiting periods or limitations for preexisting
conditions for each Transferred Employee under the medical and pharmacy
benefit programs of Buyer made available to such Transferred Employees on or
following his respective Transfer Date, to the same extent such periods or
limitations would have been or were waived by Seller and its Affiliates for
the same purpose under the comparable type of medical or pharmacy benefit
program in which such Transferred Employee was participating or eligible to
participate immediately prior to his respective Transfer Date. Buyer further
agrees to credit each Transferred Employee for amounts paid by such or
Transferred Employee under the medical or pharmacy benefit program in which
such Transferred Employee was participating immediately prior to his
respective Transfer Date towards satisfaction of the applicable deductibles
and out-of-pocket limits under the comparable type of medical or pharmacy
benefit program of Buyer in which such Transferred Employee first participates
on or after his respective Transfer Date, to the 

same extent such credit was given under the applicable medical or pharmacy
benefit program, and in each case in respect of the plan year in which occurs
his respective Transfer Date.

(ii) Buyer also shall honor all vacation, personal and sick days accrued by
each Transferred Employee under the plans, policies, programs and arrangements
of Seller or its Affiliates (or a predecessor to such entity\'s business or
assets) immediately prior to each such Transferred Employee\'s respective
Transfer Date to the extent not cashed out by Seller or its Affiliates.

(iii) Buyer shall provide continuation health care coverage to Transferred
Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur a qualifying event, in
accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements of COBRA
after the Closing Date.

(i) Flexible Spending Accounts. Seller and its Affiliates shall provide all
Transferred Employees access to their Flexible Spending Accounts to pay
qualified expenses after Closing in the same manner as is provided to all
terminated employees under the PPL Cafeteria Plan and in compliance with
COBRA.

(j) 401(k) Plan. From and for a period of not less one year after the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees to cause one or more defined contribution plans that are
maintained or contributed to by Buyer that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code
("Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan") to provide each Transferred Employee an opportunity
to make a direct rollover to Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan of an eligible distribution
from the 401(k) plans of Seller or any of its Affiliates ("Seller\'s 401(k)
Plans") that includes promissory notes (to the extent not then in default)
reflecting such Transferred Employees\' then outstanding participant loans
under Seller\'s 401(k) Plans.

(k) Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless
from and against any and all liabilities, claims and obligations (including
attorney\'s fees and other costs of defense) arising out of or otherwise in
respect of (A) a termination of any Transferred Employees by Buyer that occurs
on the Closing Date, or (B) any suit or claim of violation brought against
Seller or any of its Affiliates under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq., or any state plant closing or
severance law (collectively, "WARN") for any actions taken by Buyer on or
after the Closing Date with regard to any site of employment, facility,
operating unit or employee affected by this Agreement.

(l) Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs. During the ninety (90)-day period
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not terminate the employment of any
Transferred Employees in such numbers as would trigger any liability under
WARN to Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided that on or before the
Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall provide Buyer with a list of all
Scheduled Employees who have incurred an employment loss during the ninety
(90)-day period ending on the Closing Date.

(m) No Amendments; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. All provisions contained in
this Section 5.14 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement, and nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any
third-party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other 

Person, including, without limitation, any current or former employee, any
participant in any Benefit Plan, or any dependent, alternative payee or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Seller, Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates or continued participation in any Benefit Plan.

SECTION 5.15. Cash Grant Matters.

(a) Buyer agrees to be jointly and severally liable with Seller for any
"recapture" within the meaning of Section 1603 and the Section 1603 Program
Guidance, of the Section 1603 Grant.

(b) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action which reasonably could be
expected to, or actually does, result in any "recapture" within the meaning of
Section 1603 and the Section 1603 Program Guidance.

(c) Seller shall grant to Buyer (or its designees) access at all reasonable
times to all of the information, books and records relating to the Acquired
Assets within the possession of Seller (including workpapers and
correspondence with Governmental Authorities and reasonable access to
Seller\'s employees), and shall afford Buyer (or its designees) the right (at
Buyer\'s expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to
the extent reasonably necessary to permit Buyer (or its designees) to comply
with its obligations with respect to the Section 1603 Grant, including
responding to inquiries. Buyer shall grant to Seller (or its designees) access
at all reasonable times to all of the information, books and records relating
to the Acquired Assets within the possession of Buyer (including workpapers
and correspondence with Governmental Entities and reasonable access to
Buyer\'s employees), and shall afford Seller (or its designees) the right (at
Seller\'s expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to
the extent reasonably necessary to permit Seller (or its designees) to comply
with its obligations with respect to the Section 1603 Grant. Seller and Buyer
will preserve all information, records or documents in their respective
possessions relating to the Section 1603 Grant until six (6) months after the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including extensions
thereof) with respect to Section 1603; provided, that no Party shall dispose
of any of the foregoing items without first offering such items to the other
Party.

(d) Buyer shall, during the period ending on March 5, 2018, (i) operate the
Rainbow Redevelopment Property in compliance with the restrictions and
covenants set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Section 1603 Grant,
and (ii) provide Seller, on an annual basis and no later than March 10th of
each year, the information set forth in, and in accordance with, Schedule
5.15(d) and any additional information requested by Seller that is reasonably
necessary to allow Seller to comply with the annual performance report and
certification requirements for purposes of the Section 1603 Grant. Seller
shall comply with the annual performance report and certification requirements
for purposes of the Section 1603 Grant. After the Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall have the right to review and comment on all correspondence between the
other Party and the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service or the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory relating to the Section 1603 Grant,
including the information reporting set forth on Schedule 5.15(d), and no such
correspondence will be sent without such Party\'s prior written approval (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that, prior to
the Closing, Buyer shall not have any right to comment on such correspondence,
and Seller may send 

any such correspondence without Buyer\'s prior written approval.

(e) During the period ending on March 5, 2018, Buyer shall not permit the
Rainbow Redevelopment Property to be directly or indirectly owned by a
Disqualified Owner.

(f) In the event that Buyer receives the Section 1603 Grant with respect to
the Rainbow Redevelopment Property, Buyer shall pay over to Seller the amount
received with respect to such Section 1603 Grant within ten (10) days of
receipt thereof.

(g) Both Parties shall permit the Department of Treasury, as the awarding
office, the cognizant Department of Treasury inspector general, and the
Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized
representatives, the right of physical access to the Rainbow Redevelopment
Property and to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records
(electronic and otherwise) of the Parties or its Affiliates and each
partnership and pass-through entity that directly or indirectly owns an
interest in the Parties which are pertinent to the Section 1603 Grant payment,
in order to conduct audits, examinations, and evaluations.

(h) The Parties agree that any information provided to the Department of
Treasury in the application, attachments, supporting documents, reports or
otherwise in connection with Seller\'s application in respect of the Section
1603 Grant may be shared with other federal agencies, including the Internal
Revenue Service, as needed by those agencies to conduct official agency
business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, bank account information and
proprietary information will not be shared unless required by Law.

(i) The Parties acknowledge that, in respect of the Section 1603 Grant, the
Department of Treasury may publicly release (i) the name of the applicant,
(ii) the type, location, and description of the property that is the subject
of the application, and (iii) the amount of funding provided.

SECTION 5.16. Real Property.

(a) Buyer may obtain (i) on or before 120 days prior to the Closing Date, one
or more commitments for title insurance issued by the Title Insurance Company
to insure title to the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property in
favor of Buyer, in an amount as reasonably determined by Buyer and with all
endorsements agreed to by Buyer (each, a "Title Insurance Commitment"), (ii)
current proformas of extended coverage owner\'s policies of title insurance
from the Title Insurance Company in an amount as reasonably determined by
Buyer, insuring good, marketable and insurable title to the Owned Real
Property and the Leased Real Property in favor of Buyer, subject only to
Permitted Liens, dated as of the Closing Date and with all endorsements agreed
to by Buyer (each, a "Title Insurance Policy") and (iii) ALTA/ACSM surveys of
the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property prepared by one or more
licensed professional surveyors selected by Buyer and dated no earlier than
120 days prior to the Closing Date (the "Surveys"). Buyer shall be responsible
for all costs of the Title Insurance Commitments, Title Insurance Policies and
the Surveys.

(b) Buyer may object to any matters shown on the Title Insurance Commitments
and/or the Surveys, other than Permitted Liens, by delivering written notice
(the "Title and Survey 

Objection Notice") to Seller no later than thirty (30) days after receipt by
Buyer of all the Title Insurance Commitments and Surveys. All matters
reflected on the Title Insurance Commitments and Surveys shall be deemed
"Permitted Encumbrances," except to the extent Buyer objects to any such
matters in a Title and Survey Objection Notice delivered to Seller within the
prescribed thirty (30)-day period. Seller shall, within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of the Title and Survey Objection Notice from Buyer, deliver an
estimate of the cost to remove or rectify such matters identified as
objections in the Title and Survey Objection Notice (the "Objectionable Title
and Survey Matters"). If such cost, in the aggregate (excluding any amount
related to a mortgage or deed of trust), does not exceed ten percent (10%) of
the Base Purchase Price, Seller shall remove or rectify the Objectionable
Title and Survey Matters; provided, however, that if such removal or
rectification cannot be effected prior to Closing, Seller may elect (i) to
delay Closing for up to sixty (60) days until such removal or rectification is
complete (but not, without the Buyer\'s consent, beyond the Outside Date) or
(ii) to indemnify Buyer with respect to such Objectionable Title and Survey
Matters, which shall thereafter constitute Excluded Liabilities pursuant to
this Agreement. If the removal or rectification cost is in excess of 10% of
the Base Purchase Price, (A) either Party may, by notice to the other Party
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of such estimate by
Seller, elect to terminate this Agreement or (B) if neither Party exercises
such right to terminate, Seller shall remove or rectify such Objectionable
Title and Survey Matters, at Seller\'s expense, or shall indemnify Buyer with
respect to such Objectionable Title and Survey Matter, which shall thereafter
constitute an Excluded Liability pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Seller shall execute and deliver such title certificates and other
instruments as are reasonably and customarily required by the Title Insurance
Company in order for the Title Insurance Company to issue the Title Insurance
Policies on the Closing Date; provided that with respect to any such
certificate or instrument, Seller shall not be required to undertake any
obligation or incur any liability with respect to Permitted Liens (except for
any Permitted Liens in respect of Excluded Liabilities), but if requested by
the Title Company, Seller shall specifically identify any agreement,
instrument or other matter existing, arising or contemplated pursuant to
clause (b), (f) and/or (j) of the definition of Permitted Liens.

SECTION 5.17. Monthly Operating Report. During the Interim Period, on or prior
to thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month, Seller shall
provide Buyer with the monthly operating reports with respect to the
Facilities set forth on Schedule 5.17 prepared in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

SECTION 5.18. Kerr Conveyance Price.



(a) Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Buyer
Entities from and against any and all Damages incurred by such Indemnified
Buyer Entities to the extent arising out of (i) any Claim arising out of or
related to ordering paragraph (C)(3)(a) of the Kerr FERC License or the
determination of the Kerr Estimated Conveyance Price or the Kerr Actual
Conveyance Price pursuant to the Kerr FERC License, or (ii) any Claim by the
CSKT asserting Damages or otherwise seeking redress for any actual or alleged
act or omission of Seller prior to Closing (each, a "Kerr Claim").

(b) Seller may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of,
or to defend, any such Kerr Claim (including any appeal thereof), in each case
at its sole cost and 

expense and with its own counsel, if (i) Seller provides written notice to
Buyer that Seller intends to undertake such defense and (ii) Seller conducts
the defense of the Kerr Claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer.

(c) If Seller has elected to defend a Kerr Claim but is not recognized as the
party in interest in the related proceeding following Closing due to Seller no
longer being licensee under the Kerr FERC License, Buyer shall participate in
any Kerr Claim at the direction of Seller, at Seller\'s sole cost and expense,
including by taking any reasonable actions (including making filings with any
Governmental Entity) at the direction of Seller relating to defense of any
Kerr Claim (including any actions, including any appeal, with respect to the
arbitration as to the Kerr Estimated Conveyance Price or the Kerr Actual
Conveyance Price).

(d) If Seller does not elect to defend such a Kerr Claim, Buyer may (subject
to Seller\'s continuing right of election in Section 5.18(b)), at its option,
defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such Kerr Claim.

(e) Except with the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Party shall (i) settle
or compromise any Kerr Claim that such Party is defending, or permit a default
judgment or consent to an entry of judgment under any such Kerr Claim; or (ii)
submit any proposed calculation of the Kerr Estimated Conveyance Price or the
Kerr Actual Conveyance Price in any proceeding or otherwise pursuant to the
Kerr FERC License. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall have the right
to settle or compromise a Kerr Claim that such Party is not defending pursuant
to this Section 5.18.

(f) Each of the Parties shall promptly notify the other Party of any material
developments in connection with any Kerr Claim, as they become known to such
Party. From and after the Closing, Seller shall consult with Buyer at
reasonable times or promptly upon Buyer\'s written request regarding strategy,
tactics, settlement discussions and status in relation to the defense of any
Kerr Claim undertaken by Seller.

(g) From and after the Closing until the Kerr Conveyance Date and except (x)
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (y) as required by applicable Law
or Permit or (z) as consented to by Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Buyer shall operate and
maintain the Kerr Plant and otherwise conduct its business relating to the
Kerr Plant in the ordinary course of business, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve, maintain and protect the Kerr Plant in
compliance in all material respects with applicable Permits and Laws.

(h) If the Kerr True-Up Amount is a positive number, then, within one (1)
Business Day following the Kerr Conveyance Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the Kerr True-Up Amount. If the Kerr True-Up Amount is a
negative number, then on the Kerr Conveyance Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to the absolute value of the Kerr True-Up Amount.

(i) Any additional amounts paid by the CSKT to Buyer following the Kerr
Conveyance Date pursuant to ordering paragraph (C)(3) of the Kerr FERC License
shall be retained by Buyer to the extent the portion of such additional
amounts is attributable to capital 

expenditures (net of depreciation), depreciation and other factors related to
the difference between the Kerr Actual Conveyance Price and the Kerr Estimated
Conveyance Price occurring after Closing and shall be paid promptly by Buyer
to Seller to the extent the portion of such additional amount is attributable
to capital expenditures (net of depreciation), depreciation and other factors
related to the difference between the Kerr Actual Conveyance Price and the
Kerr Estimated Conveyance Price occurring prior to Closing. Any additional
amounts paid by Buyer to the CSKT following the Kerr Conveyance Date pursuant
to ordering paragraph (C)(3) of the Kerr FERC License shall be borne by Buyer
without the right of reimbursement from Seller to the extent the portion of
such additional amount is attributable to capital expenditures (net of
depreciation), depreciation and other factors related to the difference
between the Kerr Actual Conveyance Price and the Kerr Estimated Conveyance
Price occurring after Closing and shall be promptly paid by Seller to Buyer to
the extent the portion of such additional amount is attributable to capital
expenditures (net of depreciation), depreciation and other factors related to
the difference between the Kerr Actual Conveyance Price and the Kerr Estimated
Conveyance Price occurring prior to Closing. Buyer and Seller agree to
cooperate reasonably in order to effectuate the allocations contemplated
pursuant to this section.

SECTION 5.19. Seller Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and to cause its Affiliates
to cooperate (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller and its Affiliates), with
Buyer in connection with Buyer obtaining the Financing, or in order to comply
with Buyer\'s current or future obligations under applicable securities Law
(including Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933), by:

(a) furnishing financial and other pertinent and customary information
relating to the Acquired Assets and the business of Seller in owning,
operating and maintaining the Acquired Assets, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, to Buyer and the Financing Sources to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer, including financial statements (which, with respect to
annual financial statements, shall have been audited and, with respect to
interim financial statements, shall have been reviewed by the independent
accountants for Seller as provided in Statement on Auditing Standards No.
100), and other business and financial data, in each case, of the type and
form required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933 and of the
type and form customarily included in a registration statement on Form S-1 for
a non-reporting company under the Securities Act of 1933 for a public offering
of debt or equity securities, all other data that would be necessary for the
underwriter of such offering of securities by Buyer to receive customary
"comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) from Seller\'s independent
accountants in connection with such offering of securities, data related to
the Acquired Assets that would be necessary to obtain or confirm a corporate
rating for secured and unsecured indebtedness of Buyer in respect of such
offering of securities, all data of the type customarily required by lenders
in connection with secured or unsecured debt financings, and such other

negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing,
(iii) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to Buyer to funding in any
definitive agreement with respect to the Financing and to consummate the

Commitment Letter to the extent failure to so enforce would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse impact on the amount of the Financing or
the availability of the Financing at the Closing and (v) to comply with its

would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the amount
of the Financing or the availability of the Financing at the Closing. 

(b) Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter that imposes
new or additional conditions, in each case, that would reasonably be expected

contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that Buyer may
amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents,
managers or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as

able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing. If any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex

replacement thereof alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event.

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Lease Termination Closing thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Seller shall give Buyer prompt notice of any breach or default by
any party to any Lease Termination Agreement of which Seller becomes aware, if
such breach or default would reasonably be expected to materially adversely

Lease Termination Agreements (including evidence of the surrender and
cancellation of each Lease Indenture (as defined in the Lease Termination

Buyer one or more alternative agreements, reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
pursuant to which the four (4) Lease Participation Agreements, or any terms
thereunder, have been terminated, amended or waived such that the consummation
by Seller of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement will not
contravene or violate any provision of the Lease Participation Agreements.

SECTION 5.25. Rainbow Demolition Plan. Prior to incurring any Rainbow
Demolition Costs, Buyer shall present the proposed plan and budget in
connection with the demolition of the old power house at the Rainbow Plant to
Seller for review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), and Buyer shall adhere to such plan and budget in all material
respects or obtain Seller\'s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) with respect to any changes thereto or deviations
therefrom, provided that no approval by Seller shall be required with respect

Section 7.2 or 7.3 for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement may be made after the expiration of the applicable survival period
under this Section 7.1; provided that if a written claim or written notice is
duly given in good faith under this Article VII with respect to any claim for

in this Section 7.1, the claim with respect to such alleged breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall continue indefinitely
until such claim is finally resolved pursuant to this Article VII.

SECTION 7.2. Indemnification by Seller.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this
Article VII, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the "Indemnified Buyer Entities")
and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages
suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Buyer Entity and caused by or
resulting from (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by any Seller Party to Buyer in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, (ii) any breach by any Seller Party of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any recapture of the Section 1603 Grant as a
result of a breach by Seller of any of its covenants in Section 5.15 of this
Agreement or (iii) any Excluded Liability.

(b) The Indemnified Buyer Entities shall be entitled to indemnification with
respect to (x) any claim pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) and (y) any claim
arising from breach of covenant set forth in Section 5.2 by Seller in respect
of compliance with Law or Permits pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii), in each
case, only if:

(i) the amount of Damages with respect to such claim (aggregating all Damages
with respect to claims arising from substantially identical facts) exceeds the
amount of $200,000 (any claim involving Damages equal to or less than such
amount being referred to as a "De Minimis Claim"); and

(ii) then only to the extent that the aggregate Damages to all Indemnified
Buyer Entities, with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than De Minimis Claims), exceed the amount of one
percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), whereupon Seller
shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts (other than in respect of
any De Minimis Claim) but only to the extent such aggregate Damages are in
excess of the amount of the Deductible. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.2
(other than the immediately following sentence of this Section 7.2(c)), in no
event shall the Indemnified Buyer Entities be entitled to aggregate Damages
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) in excess of the amount of twenty percent (20%)
of the Base Purchase Price (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 7.2 to the contrary, the De Minimis Claim threshold, the Deductible
and the Cap shall not apply to any indemnification obligation of Seller
pursuant to (i) Section 7.2(a)(i) arising out of or resulting from any breach
of any Designated Representation or the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.15 (Taxes), (ii) Section 7.2(a)(ii) (other than for a
breach of any covenant or agreement contained in Section 5.2) or (iii) Section
7.2(a)(iii); provided, however, that in all events Seller shall not be
required to indemnify the Indemnified Buyer Entities pursuant to Section
7.2(a)(i) for Damages in excess of the Base Purchase Price.

SECTION 7.3. Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this
Article VII, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the "Indemnified Seller Entities")
and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages
suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Seller Entity and caused by or
resulting from (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by Buyer to Seller in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (ii) any
breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any recapture of the Section
1603 Grant as a result of a breach by Buyer of any of its covenants in Section
5.15 of this Agreement, or (iii) any Assumed Liability.

(b) The Indemnified Seller Entities shall be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any claim pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) only if:

(i) such claim (aggregating all Damages with respect to claims arising from
substantially identical facts) is not a De Minimis Claim; and

(ii) then only to the extent that the aggregate Damages to all Indemnified
Seller Entities with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.3(a)(i) (including all De Minimis Claims) exceed the Deductible,
whereupon Buyer shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts (other than
in respect to any De Minimis Claims) but only to the extent such aggregate
Damages are in excess of the amount of the Deductible.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3
(other than the immediately following sentence of this Section 7.3(c)), in no
event shall the Indemnified Seller Entities be entitled to aggregate Damages
pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) in excess of the Cap. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 7.3 to the contrary, the De Minimis Claim threshold, the
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any indemnification obligation of
Buyer pursuant to (i) Section 7.3(a)(i) arising out of or resulting from any
breach of any Designated Representation or the representation and warranty
contained in Section 4.12 (Tax Matters), (ii) Section 7.3(a)(ii) and (iii)
Section 7.3(a)(iii); provided, however, that in all events Buyer shall not be
required to indemnify the Indemnified Seller Entities pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(i) for Damages in excess of the Base Purchase Price. 

SECTION 7.4. Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If an Indemnified Buyer Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each, an
"Indemnified Entity") believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance
exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under Article VII or Section 5.1(c) (whether or not the amount
of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity
shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a
"Claim Notice") to the party from which indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim
for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim, suit, action or proceeding
brought by a Person not a party to this Agreement or affiliated with any such
party (a "Third Party"), within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of
notice of such Claim by such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the event or
occurrence giving rise to such action or claim for indemnification is not, or
does not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third Party, within thirty (30) days
after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise
to such Claim for indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in
reasonable detail. The failure by the Indemnified Entity to so notify, or any
delay by the Indemnified Entity in notifying, the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder
except to the extent that the defense of such Claim is materially prejudiced
by such failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice.

(b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Entity under Article VII or
Sections 5.1(c), 5.3(c)(ii), 5.14(k), 5.16(b) or 5.18(a) relates to a claim
filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party, the Indemnifying
Party may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such
claim or to defend such claim, in each case at its sole cost and expense and
with its own counsel, if (i) the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to
the Indemnified Entity that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such
defense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the third-party
claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Entity, and (iii) if the Indemnifying Party is a party to the
proceeding, the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Entity has not
reasonably determined in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate because of a conflict of interest.

(c) Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Entity, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no
Indemnifying Party shall settle or compromise any third-party claim or permit
a default judgment or consent to an entry of judgment unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) relates solely to money damages, (ii) provides for
a full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Entity with
respect to the claim(s) being settled and (iii) does not contain any admission
or finding of wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Entity. If, within
twenty (20) days of receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice
with respect to a Third Party claim the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
defend such Third Party claim, such Indemnified Entity may (subject to the
Indemnifying Party\'s continuing right of election in subpart (b) of this
Section 7.4), at its option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay
such claim; provided, that any such settlement or compromise shall be
permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Unless and until the Indemnifying Party makes an election in accordance with
this Section 7.4(c) to defend, settle or compromise such claim, all of the
Indemnified Entity\'s reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the
defense, settlement or compromise of any such claim shall be Damages subject
to indemnification 

hereunder to the extent provided herein. Subject to Section 5.5, each
Indemnified Entity shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all
information reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity relating to such
claim (other than materials, if any, subject to attorney-client or attorney-
work product privilege). In addition, the Parties shall render to each other
such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper
and adequate defense of any such claim. The Party in charge of the defense
shall keep the other Parties fully apprised at all times as to the status of
the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend any such claim, then the Indemnified
Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense with separate counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnified Entity\'s
sole cost and expense (except where there is a conflict of interest that makes
it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Entity
and the Indemnifying Party).

SECTION 7.5. General.

(a) No Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for
indemnification under this Article VII or Sections 5.1(c), 5.3(c)(ii),
5.14(k), 5.16(b) or 5.18(a) to take any action to obtain any insurance
proceeds available to it with regard to the applicable claims or to recover
any amounts to which it may be entitled in respect of the applicable claims
pursuant to contractual or other indemnification rights that the Indemnified
Entity may have against Third Parties. If an Indemnified Entity shall have
received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in
respect of Damages and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other
amounts in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnified Entity shall
promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such
insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received to the extent such
amount would give rise to a double recovery by such Indemnified Entity.

(b) Subject to Section 7.5(a), each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in
connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article VII to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages upon and after becoming
aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to such
Damages, including not undertaking, or soliciting or importuning any
Government Entity to require any correction, investigation, monitoring,
removal, remediation or other similar affirmative commitments unless, (i) as
determined in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Entity,
such action is affirmatively required by Law, including Environmental Laws, or
(ii) such action is required in response to an imminent threat to human health
or the environment.

(c) For the sole purpose of determining the amount of Damages (and not for
determining whether or not any breaches of representations or warranties have
occurred hereunder), each representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement that is qualified by materiality, including by reference to Material
Adverse Effect, shall be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification for purposes of this Article VII.

(d) Subject to the rights of any insurance carriers, the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to any right of action that the Indemnified Entity may
have against any other Person (other than any insurance carriers) with respect
to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. 

(e) The indemnification provided in this Article VII shall be the exclusive
post-Closing remedy available to any Party hereto with respect to any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (including Section 7.7(a) or in cases of fraud).

(f) If any fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a claim for
indemnification under this Article VII shall overlap with any fact,
circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any other
claim for indemnification under this Article VII, there shall be no
duplication in the calculation of the amount of the Damages. In addition,
neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability under this Article VII for
Damages relating to matters to the extent included in the calculation of the
Capital Expenditures Adjustment or the PPA Termination Adjustment (other than
the failure to pay amounts (if any) that become due and payable by Seller
pursuant to Section 2.2) in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2.

(g) An Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified
Entity to the extent of any Damages that a court of competent jurisdiction or
arbitrator shall have determined by final, non-appealable judgment to have
resulted from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Indemnified Entity seeking indemnification or its officers, directors,
employees or Affiliates.

interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any Party shall not apply to any construction or
interpretation hereof.

those of any Exhibit or Schedule, the provisions of this Agreement shall
prevail.

SECTION 9.10. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of Buyer and Seller. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective, unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

SECTION 9.11. Schedules and Exhibits. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be
and hereby are made a part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in any Party\'s
Schedule under this Agreement corresponding to and qualifying a specific
numbered paragraph shall be deemed to correspond to and qualify any other

liability with respect to the matters covered by the information, and may not
be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of
any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is not
intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item, or
matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.12. Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources. None of the
Financing Sources will have any liability to Seller or its Affiliates relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or otherwise, whether at
law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the 

Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. In no event shall Seller be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against
the Financing Sources. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed
as of the day and year first above written.
