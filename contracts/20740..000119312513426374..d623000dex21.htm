that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable Claims Period specified in <U>Section&nbsp;10.07</U> for such representation, warranty,

Indemnifying Party so elects to undertake any such defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense, except as set forth in the following sentence. In such event, an Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense if the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake such defense,
the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence after consultation with the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates, members, officers,
agents and employees to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, no settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from,
any Third Party Claim may be made by the Indemnifying Party without the consent of any Indemnified Party unless (i)&nbsp;the settlement or judgment involves only monetary payments, (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid all
amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment promptly following the effectiveness of such settlement or judgment and (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party obtains, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete release of any
Indemnified Party affected by such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within the time period set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.03(b)</U>, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
defend and control such Third Party Claim but shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. </P>
