respective Affiliates, shall have the right to compel disclosure of
such privileged information.

Section 2.03.  _Assignment of Contracts and Rights_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Transferred Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an
attempted assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party
thereto, (i) would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof, (ii)
would be ineffective or render the Transferred Asset or any claim or right or
any benefit arising thereunder void or voidable, or (iii) would in any way
adversely affect the rights of the Buyer (or the applicable Buying Affiliate)
thereto or thereunder, and such consent has not been obtained on or prior to
the Closing. Subject to _Section 5.05(d)_, the Sellers will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent necessary for the
assignment of any such Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder to the Buyer (or the applicable Buying Affiliate) as the
Buyer may request. If such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, or if
an attempted transfer or assignment thereof would be ineffective or
would adversely affect the rights of the Buyer or the applicable Buying
Affiliate (as assignee of the applicable Seller) thereto or thereunder so that
the Buyer or the applicable Buying Affiliate would not in fact receive all
such rights, (i) the Sellers and the Buyer shall, subject to _Section
5.05(d)_, cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which the Buyer
or the applicable Buying Affiliate would, in compliance with Law, obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated
with such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit in accordance with this
Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the Buyer
or the applicable Buying Affiliate, or under which the Sellers would enforce
for the benefit of the Buyer or the applicable Buying Affiliate any and all of
their rights against a third party associated with such Transferred Asset,
claim, right or benefit (collectively, " _Third Party Rights_ "), and the
Sellers would promptly pay to the Buyer or the applicable Buying Affiliate
when received all monies received by them under any such Transferred Asset,
claim, right or benefit, and (ii) after the Closing, subject to  _Section
5.05(d_) and except as otherwise requested by Buyer, the Buyer and the Sellers
shall continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consent necessary for any such consent, and, upon the receipt of
such consent, will immediately transfer such Transferred Asset, claim, right
or benefit to Buyer or the applicable Buying Affiliate.

 

Section 2.04. _Closing_. On the second Business Day following the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.01_  and _8.02_ (or such other
date as the Buyer and the Sellers may agree in writing), the sale and purchase
of the Shares and the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the
" _Closing_ ") that will be held at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1180
Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, or such other place as GE and the
Buyer may agree in writing, the date on which the Closing takes place being
the " _Closing Date_." For all purposes under this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements, all matters at Closing will be considered to take place
simultaneously, no delivery of any document will be deemed complete until all
transactions and deliveries of documents are completed.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
the Buyer will pay (for itself and as agent for the Buying Affiliates) to the
Sellers the Closing Cash Amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. dollars, except as may be required by applicable Law
as reasonably determined by Buyer, in which case the applicable Buying
Affiliate will pay (with the Buyer as guarantor of such obligation) to the
Sellers the Closing Cash Amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in local currency calculated using the exchange rate determined in
accordance with _Section 2.12(b)_. Prior to the Closing, GE and Buyer will
reasonably agree as to the allocation of the Purchase Price as among the
Shares and each of the Sellers (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ").

Section 2.06. _Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) The " _Closing Adjustment Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount set forth in the Statement of
Estimated Closing Working Capital less $38,269,000. If the Closing Adjustment
Amount is a positive amount, then the Closing Cash Amount paid by the Buyer at
Closing shall be increased by the Closing Adjustment Amount. If the
Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then the Closing Cash Amount
paid by the Buyer at Closing shall be decreased by the Closing Adjustment
Amount.

 

(b) The Sellers shall prepare in good faith and, not less than five Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, deliver to the Buyer a written
statement (the " _Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") setting

Buyer and its Representatives access to all relevant documents and
information (including any working papers, trial balances and similar
materials relating thereto) reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection
with its review of the Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital and
the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount (including all

 



10  components thereof), provided that the accountants of the Sellers shall not
be obliged to make any work papers available to the Buyer or its
Representatives unless and until the Sellers have signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall notify the Sellers of any objections to the Statement of
Estimated Closing Working Capital or the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Amount. The Sellers shall consider, in good faith, but shall not be obligated
to accept, any such objections made by the Buyer on the Statement of Estimated
Closing Working Capital or Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount. The
failure of the Sellers to include any changes proposed by the Buyer, or the
acceptance by the Buyer of the Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital
or Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount, shall not limit or otherwise
affect the Buyers remedies under this Agreement, including the Buyers right
to include such changes or other changes in the Closing Working Capital
Statement, or constitute an acknowledgement by the Buyer of the accuracy of
the Statement of Estimated Closing Working Capital or Estimated Closing
Working Capital Amount.

(c) The Buyer and the Sellers will mutually agree on a date(s) within five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date on which the Sellers will count
the inventory of the Business in the United States and the United Kingdom for
purposes of determining the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount and the
Closing Working Capital Amount. The Buyer shall be entitled to designate one

GE and the Buyer disagree as set out in the Notice of Disagreement, which
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties to this
Agreement. Such notice shall also set forth the final calculation of the

Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " means the amount of Closing Working
Capital Amount set forth in

 



14  the Final Working Capital Statement less the Estimated Closing Working
Capital Amount. If the Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a
positive amount, then the Buyer shall pay in cash to the Sellers (as
allocated as directed by GE consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation) the
Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Working
Capital Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then the Sellers (consistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation) shall pay in cash to the Buyer the Post-
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Any such payment shall be made
within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital Amount in accordance with _Section 2.10_, together

All payments shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the party receiving such payment
and shall be free and clear of any withholding for Taxes. All computations of
interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. Whenever any
payment under this Agreement shall be due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of payment of
interest.

(b) To the extent that any currency conversions may be required by this
transaction, the parties will use the applicable spot currency exchange rates

Assets and Assumed Liabilities being, respectively, acquired and assumed by
the Buyer itself, the transfer of the Transferred Assets and Assumed
Liabilities will be effected at the Closing pursuant to short-form asset
transfer agreements entered into between the applicable Seller and the
applicable Buying Affiliate in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and
GE (the " _Business Transfer Agreements_ "). Buyer guarantees the payment and
performance of all obligations of the Buying Affiliates under the Business
Transfer Agreement.

equal to the amount of any net gain recognized on the settlement of such Hedge
Contracts in the aggregate, which will be paid by GE to the Buyer promptly
following receipt of such payment by GE from the holders of the
Hedge Contracts.

of its owned, operated or leased properties or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification material to the Altair U.S. Assets or the Transferred
Assets, except for jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not or would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the Business in any material respect. The execution and delivery by the GE
Entities of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which they are
parties and the consummation by the GE Entities of the transactions
contemplated by, and the performance by the GE Entities of their obligations
under, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which they are parties

parties will be, duly executed and delivered by the GE Entities, and

Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement constitute, and upon execution and
delivery the other Ancillary Agreements will constitute, legal, valid and
binding obligations of the GE Entities (as applicable), enforceable against
the GE Entities (as applicable) in accordance with their terms, subject to the
effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Section 3.02. _Capitalization of Altair U.S._ There are 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share of Altair U.S. authorized, 150 of which are

rights of first refusal. There are no outstanding options, warrants or rights
of conversion or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
kind relating to the capital stock or other equity interests of Altair U.S.,
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or other

sell any shares of capital

_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between the Buyer and GE are incorporated into
this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until
the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate;
provided, however, that the Buyers confidentiality obligations
thereunder will continue in effect with respect to (and only with respect to)
that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) that is not included in the Transferred Assets in accordance with
the terms set forth therein;  _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing contained
herein or the Confidentiality Agreement will prohibit the Buyer or its
Affiliates from disclosing any information to the extent required by
applicable Law or legal process or in order for the Buyer or its Affiliates
to comply with their legal, Tax and reporting obligations. If, for any reason,
the sale of the Shares and the Transferred Assets is not consummated, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force
and effect.

 



36 (b) After the Closing (and, in the case of the CLC Information, after the date
of this Agreement), except to the extent required by applicable Law or legal
process or in order for the Sellers and their Affiliates to comply with their
legal, Tax and reporting obligations, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall
not use, or disclose, disseminate or divulge to any third party, any
Business/CLC Confidential Information (as defined below) (including any such
Business/CLC Confidential Information disclosed or obtained pursuant to
Sections 2.09 and 5.03); provided, however, that nothing contained in this
_Section 5.04(b)_ will restrict Seller or its Affiliates from using any
Retained Business Confidential Information (as defined below) outside of any
Covered Business during the Restrictive Covenant Period provided that Seller
and its Affiliates do not otherwise violate the terms of _Section 5.14_
hereof. After the Closing, in the event that the Sellers or their Affiliates
or their respective Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required
by, applicable Law or legal process to disclose any such Business/CLC
Confidential Information, the Sellers shall provide the Buyer prompt written
notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Buyer to seek an
appropriate protective order or other remedy (and if the Buyer seeks such an
order, the Sellers and their Affiliates will provide such cooperation as the
Buyer shall reasonably request at the Buyers expense) and shall consult with
the Buyer with respect to taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such
disclosure. For purposes of this Agreement, "Business/CLC Confidential
Information" means all documentation, data and other information that (i) is
related to Buyer or its Affiliates that has been provided by Buyer or its
Affiliates to any Seller or any of their Affiliates in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the information
referenced in clause (i), " _CLC Information_ "), (ii) is included in the
Transferred Assets, (iii) is held by Altair U.S. and is not an Excluded Asset,
or (iv) is not included in the Transferred Assets or held by Altair U.S. but
otherwise relates to (but only to the extent that such documentation, data
and other information relates to) the Business and has been provided by any GE
Entity or its Affiliates to Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
information referenced in clause (iv), the " _Retained Confidential
Information_ "), whether any such documentation, data or other information is
in oral, written or electronic form or retained in the memory of any recipient
thereof and including any documentation prepared by any Seller or its
Affiliates based on, containing or otherwise reflecting such documentation,
data or other information; provided, however, that Business/CLC Confidential
Information will not include any documentation, data or other information
that is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach
by any Seller or its Affiliates of this _Section 5.04(b)_ or the
confidentiality obligations of Seller or its Affiliates set forth in any
Ancillary Agreement or other document to be entered into at Closing.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.04_ will restrict the rights of the
parties and their Affiliates under any Ancillary Agreement or any other
agreement to be entered into at Closing. In addition, the confidentiality
provisions set forth in the Cross License Agreement, Transitional
Services Agreement, the Customer Agreement, and any other agreement to be
entered into at Closing that includes a confidentiality provision will govern
the subject matter of those agreements in accordance with the terms set forth
therein, as applicable, in lieu of the confidentiality provisions set forth
in this Agreement.

 



37 Section 5.05. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_.

 

(a) Each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall use its best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation law that may be asserted by any Government Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur
prior to the End Date (or sooner, if practicable), including,
without limitation, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of the Business or the
Transferred Assets and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions
that after the Closing Date would limit Buyers freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or
assets of any of the Sellers, Altair U.S. or of the Business, in each case as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing (any such actions of Buyer pursuant to this sentence, the
"Requested Actions"). Buyers obligations to take the Requested Actions
pursuant to the previous sentence are subject only to a limitation that these
actions would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, (i) a material
adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of the Business, taken as a whole, or (ii) a material adverse
effect on the assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any such case,
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Sellers will
cooperate with the reasonable requests of the Buyer in promptly seeking to
obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Neither the
Sellers nor the Buyer shall take any action that they should be reasonably
aware would have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding in any
material respect the receipt of any required approvals.

(b) The Sellers and the Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed, all required
notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, and in
any event, no later than November 11, 2013 and to supply promptly any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. In addition, each party agrees to make promptly any filing
that may be required under any other antitrust or competition law or by any
other antitrust or competition authority. The Sellers and the Buyer shall each
bear fifty percent (50%) of the respective filing fees associated with the HSR
filings and any other similar filings required in any other jurisdictions.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party to this Agreement
shall promptly notify the other parties of any communication it receives from
any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement (except in relation to Tax) and permit the other parties to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority and shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, subject to _Section 5.02(b)_. No party to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and to _Section 5.02(b)_, the parties to this
Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other parties may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act.

 



38 (d) Each party to this Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any other consents, consultations and approvals that may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, (i) the Buyer and Sellers
using their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents,
consultations and approvals required under the Acquired Rights Directive
(Council Directive 2001/23/EC) as amended from time to time, and (ii) with
respect to Contracts with Independent Third Parties that require such
consents, Sellers using their reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any such
Contract to be assigned to Buyer, (B) cause any such Contract (including such
Contracts set forth on Section 2.02(b)(xviii) of the Disclosure Schedule) to
be amended to be allocated between (I) Sellers and their Affiliates and (II)
Buyer and its Affiliates, (C) facilitate the execution of a new Contract on
substantially similar terms between Buyer and any such Independent Third
Party, and/or (D) otherwise facilitate the transition with such Independent
Third Parties, in any such case to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall not be required to compensate
any third party (in excess of customary expense reimbursement), commence or
participate in litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any party to obtain any such consent or approval.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer
acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns that the operation of the Business shall remain in the
dominion and control of the GE Entities until the Closing and that none of the
foregoing Persons will provide, directly or indirectly, any directions or
orders to any director, officer or employee of any of the GE Entities, except
as specifically contemplated or permitted by this _Article V_ or as otherwise
consented to in advance by an executive officer of a GE Entity.

Section 5.06. _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Altair U.S., the Business and the
Transferred Assets shall cease to be insured by, have access or availability
to, be entitled to make claims on, be entitled to claim benefits from or seek
coverage under any of GEs or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates insurance
policies or any of their self-insured programs (for purposes of this 
_Section 5.06_, "GE" shall include, where appropriate to the context, its
Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates), other than with respect to any claim, act,
omission, event, circumstance, occurrence or loss that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing Date (hereinafter, a " _Triggering Event_ ").

 



39 (b) With respect to any Triggering Event relating to the Transferred Assets,
Assumed Liabilities, Transferred Employees, former employees of the Business,
Inactive Business Employees or Altair U.S. that would be covered by GEs third
party occurrence-based general liability insurance policies, any domestic or
international employers liability insurance policies and/or workers
compensation self-insurance, state or country comparable country programs (the
" _Available Insurance Policies_ "), Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, Altair U.S.) may access, make claims on, claim
benefits from or seek coverage under such policies and programs for a one-year
period concluding on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to the
terms and conditions of such policies and programs and this Agreement.
_provided_ that:

(i) Buyer shall promptly notify GES Corporate Insurance department of
all such claims and/or efforts to seek benefits or coverage and shall
cooperate with GE in pursuing all such claims, provided that the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) shall be solely
responsible for notifying the insurance companies of and complying with all
policy conditions for such claims;

(ii) GE shall have the right but not the duty to monitor and/or control any
coverage claims or requests for benefits asserted by the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) under the Available
Insurance Policies, including the coverage positions and arguments asserted
therein;

(iii) Buyer shall exclusively bear (and GE shall have no obligation to repay
or reimburse Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
Altair U.S.) the amount of any and all Insurance Deductibles, whether such
claims are made by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
Altair U.S.) its employees or third parties, and shall be liable for all
uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts of such claims;

(iv) Buyer shall not, without the written consent of GE (i) erode, exhaust,
settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect
to any available insurance policies and programs, or amend, modify or waive
any rights under any such insurance policies and programs or (ii) assign the
Available Insurance Policies or their rights or claims under the Available
Insurance Policies; and

 

(v) For avoidance of doubt, (A) Available Insurance Policies shall not include
any of GEs claims-made or occurrence-reported liability policies, GEs
property, terrorism, transit, and construction all risk insurance policies,
and/or GEs aviation liability policies; and (B) Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) shall not be permitted and
shall have no right to be insured by, have access or availability to, to make
claims on, be entitled to benefits from, or seek coverage under the Available
Insurance Policies after the first anniversary hereof.

(c) GE shall retain the exclusive right to control all of its insurance
policies and programs, including the Available Insurance Policies, and the
benefits payable thereunder, including the right to exhaust, settle, release,
commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its
insurance policies and programs and to amend, modify or waive any rights
under any such insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding whether any
such policies or programs apply to any liabilities, commitments, obligations
and/or claims that Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
Altair U.S.) has made or could make in the future, including coverage claims
with respect to Triggering Event(s), provided further that Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) shall cooperate
with GE and share such information as is reasonably necessary in order to
permit GE to manage and conduct its insurance matters as GE deems appropriate
and that Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair
U.S.). hereby give consent for GE to inform any affected insurer of

 



40  this Agreement and to provide such insurer with a copy hereof. Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.), in connection with
any claim that Buyer elects to make under the Available Insurance Policies
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.06_, shall pursue rights of recovery
against third parties with respect to claims or losses for which Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) have the ability
to mitigate via contract and shall cooperate with GE with respect to pursuit
of such rights. The order of priority of any such recoveries shall inure first
to GE to reimburse any and all costs incurred by GE directly or indirectly as
a result of such claims or losses.

(d) With respect to any claim payments made on all open, closed and re-opened
claims covered under GEs workers compensation, domestic or international
employers liability insurance policies and/or comparable workers
compensation self-insurance, state or country programs, Buyer and
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) will reimburse
GE for all claim payments arising from occurrences prior to the Closing Date
and any catastrophic coverage charges, overhead, claim handling and
administrative costs, taxes, surcharges, state assessments, reinsurance cost,
other related costs relating to Transferred Employees, former employees and
Inactive Business Employees whether such claims are made by Altair U.S., its
employees or third parties. Any payments, costs and adjustments required to
be made by Altair U.S. pursuant to this or any other provisions of this
_Section 5.06_ shall be billed quarterly and payable within thirty (30) days
from receipt of invoice, according to the terms outlined in the Disclosure
Schedule. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days of invoice, the
outstanding amount will accrue interest at an annualized rate equal to the
Interest Rate.

 

(e) Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.)
shall defend and indemnify GE for any and all claims, losses, costs, fees and
expenses incurred arising from (i) any claims made or benefits sought under
the Available Insurance Policies after the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, or (ii) any claims made or benefits sought after the Closing Date by
Altair U.S., its employees or third parties under GEs claims-made or
occurrence-based liability policies, GEs property insurance policies (which
include property, terrorism, transit, and Construction-All-Risk), aviation
liability policies; and (iii) breach of any of the provisions of this
_Section 5.06_. Without limitation of GEs right to obtain injunctive and
other relief as may be appropriate, GE, on the one hand, and Buyer and its
Affiliates (including following the Closing, Altair U.S.), on the other hand,
further agree that it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to
ascertain the amount of actual damages caused by breach of the provisions of
subpart (b)(v) hereof and therefore agree that, in the event breach of that
provision is established, Buyer and its Affiliates (including following the
Closing, Altair U.S.) shall pay to GE, as liquidated damages, the amount of
any such benefits or coverage paid by the insurer(s) and that this liquidated
damages provision represents reasonable compensation for the loss which would
be incurred by GE due to any such breach.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to waive or abrogate in any way GEs
own rights to insurance coverage for any liability, whether relating to the
Business, the Transferred Assets, Altair U.S. or otherwise.

(g) With respect to any and all reimbursements due from Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) as required under
this _Section 5.06_ for avoidance of doubt, such reimbursements will not be
subject to setoff against any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.11_.

 



41 (h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the terms set
forth in  _Section 5.06(a)-(g)_ will not apply to the Excluded Workers Comp
Claims being retained by GE pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)(v)_ or to any
Covered Events (which are being addressed as set forth in  _Section
5.06(i))_.

(i) If (i) any Transferred Assets that constitute real property or other
tangible personal property are damaged, lost or destroyed (any such
Transferred Assets, the " _Damaged Assets_ ") and such damage, loss or
destruction triggers a covered event within the terms and conditions of GE
property insurance programs in effect following the execution of this
Agreement but prior to the Closing (a " _Covered Event_ "), and (ii) such
Covered Event has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect, then GE will transfer to Buyer when received cash in
an amount equal to the net recovery by GE under such GE property insurance
programs in respect of such Covered Event. With respect to any Covered Event
contemplated by this _Section 5.06(i)_ that occurs prior to the Closing (A)
GE will make claims under such GE property insurance programs for any Covered
Event and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recoveries
under such claims and (B) Buyer will reasonably cooperate with GE to pursue
recoveries under such claims.

(j) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Buyer and GE shall
cooperate to obtain title insurance policies (the " _Title Insurance_ ") with
respect to (i) each parcel of the Owned Real Property in the United States and
(ii) the Owned Real Property in the United Kingdom (if available), in each
case to insure title to each such parcel in such amounts as GE reasonably
concludes in consultation with Buyer is the fair market value of such parcel;
_provided_ that the Title Insurance obtained with respect to the Owned Real
Property in the United Kingdom shall be substantially similar to a title
insurance policy that would be obtained for similar owned real property in the
United States. Such Title Insurance shall name Buyer as the insured, and the
costs of such Title Insurance will be borne by GE.

 

Section 5.07. _Letters of Credit; Other Obligations_. At or prior to the
Closing, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
arrange for substitute letters of credit, Buyer guarantees and other
obligations to replace (i) the letters of credit, guarantees and other
equivalent contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates in connection with the Business (together, the "
_Sellers  LCs_") outstanding as of the date of this Agreement as listed on
_Section 5.07_ of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) any Sellers LCs entered
into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing and in any event not
to exceed $500,000 in the aggregate without the prior written consent of the
Buyer or (b) assume all obligations under each Sellers LCs, obtaining from
the creditor or other counterparty a full release (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers) of all parties liable, directly
or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of other
obligations to a counterparty in connection with amounts drawn under the
Sellers LCs. The Buyer further agrees that to the extent the beneficiary or
counterparty under any Sellers LC does not accept any such substitute letter
of credit, Buyer guarantee or other obligation proffered by the Buyer, the
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers against, and
reimburse the Sellers for, any and all amounts

 



42  paid, including costs or expenses in connection with such Sellers LCs,
including the Sellers expenses in maintaining such Sellers LCs, whether or
not any such Sellers LC is drawn upon or required to be performed, and shall
in any event promptly reimburse the Sellers to the extent any Sellers LC is
called upon and the Sellers or their Affiliates make any payment or are
obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Sellers LC.

Section 5.08. _Intercompany Obligations_. The Sellers shall take such action
and make such payments as may be necessary so that, as of the Closing Date,
there shall be no intercompany obligations other than (a) the obligations of
the Sellers and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the Customer
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (b) all amounts Due from GE (as such
term is defined in the Transaction Accounting Principles) as reflected in the
Final Working Capital Statement (the " _GE Included Receivables_ ") or (c) as
set forth in  _Section 5.08_ of the Disclosure Schedule) between Altair U.S.
and the Business, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than Altair U.S.), on the other hand.

 

Section 5.09. _No Solicitation of Employees_.

 

(a) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, neither GE nor any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Sellers) shall, directly or indirectly,
induce to leave the employment of Buyer or its Affiliates or hire or engage,
or attempt to induce or hire or engage, any Transferred Employee, who is a Key
Employee, or induce any Key Employee to violate the terms of their
contracts, or any employment arrangements, with the Buyer or its Affiliates
or Altair U.S.; _provided_ , _however_ , that GE or any of its Subsidiaries
may solicit for employment or hire any Key Employee following such time that
any such Key Employee is discharged or constructively terminated by the Buyer
or Altair U.S.; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section
5.09(a)_ shall prohibit GE or any of its Subsidiaries from making general
solicitations to the public or general advertising not targeted at any Key
Employees provided that GE or its Subsidiaries do not hire any such Key
Employees.

 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (or in the case
of the employees referenced in subsection (B), for a period of twelve (12)
months from the termination of the Transition Services Agreement), none of the
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.)
shall, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any employee of
GE or its Affiliates who either (any such employee, a " _GE Applicable
Employee_ ") (A) (i) is or has been within the last twelve (12) months, an
executive band level or above employee, and (ii) with whom the Buyer or its
Affiliates has had contact in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including contacts prior to the date hereof), or (B) with whom the
Buyer has contact in connection with the provision of services under the
Transition Services Agreement, to leave the employ of GE or its Affiliates or
violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment arrangements, with GE
or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) may solicit for employment or
hire any such GE Applicable Employee following such time that any such GE
Applicable Employee is discharged or constructively terminated by GE or its
Affiliates; and provided, further, that nothing in this _Section 5.09(b)_
shall prohibit Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
Altair U.S.) from making general solicitations to the public or general
advertising which are not targeted to the GE Applicable Employees or from
hiring any GE Applicable Employee who responds to such general solicitation or
advertising, provided that

 



43  Buyer and its Affiliates shall not hire any employees referenced in clause
(A) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in this
_Section 5.09(b)_ will not preclude Buyer from hiring or otherwise taking
any actions with respect to the individuals set forth on _Section 5.09(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule upon the expiration of the Transition Services
Agreement.

 

 Section 5.10. _Rights to the GE Name and GE Marks_. 

 

(a) With respect to the licensing of the GE Name and GE Marks to Buyer, at the
Closing, the parties shall enter into a transitional trademark license
agreement substantially in the form set forth in _Exhibit E_ to this Agreement
(the " _Transitional Trademark License Agreement_ "). Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 5.10 or in the Transitional Trademark License
Agreement, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, Altair U.S.) shall cease and discontinue, and shall cause the
Business to cease and discontinue, all uses of the names or marks of GE or any
of its Affiliates, including "GE" (in block letters or otherwise), the GE
Monogram, "General Electric Company" and "General Electric," either alone or
in combination with other words and all marks, trade dress, logos, monograms,
domain names and other source identifiers similar to any of the foregoing or
embodying any of the foregoing alone or in combination with other words
(collectively the " _GE Name and GE Marks_ "). The Buyer, for itself and its
Affiliates, agrees that the rights of Altair U.S. and its Affiliates to the
GE Name and GE Marks pursuant to the terms of any trademark agreements between
GE and its Affiliates on the one hand and Altair U.S. and its Affiliates on
the other hand shall terminate on the Closing Date and be replaced by such
rights as are provided by the Transitional Trademark License Agreement.

(b) Except as set forth in the Transitional Trademark License Agreement, the
Buyer and its Affiliates shall within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date
cease all use of any of the GE Name and GE Marks on or in connection with all
stationery, business cards, purchase orders, agreements of sale, warranties,
indemnifications, invoices and other similar correspondence and other
documents of a contractual nature. The Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates,
agrees that after the Closing Date the Buyer and its Affiliates (i) will not
expressly, or by implication, do business as or represent themselves as GE or
its Affiliates and (ii) with respect to products sold or disposed of by them
after the Closing Date, will not represent in writing to the transferees of
such products that such products are those of GE and its Affiliates; and (iii)
will reasonably cooperate with GE or any of its Affiliates in terminating
rights under any contracts pursuant to which any Seller or Altair
U.S. licenses any of the GE Name and GE Marks to customers. The Buyer shall
take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that other users of any of the
GE Name and GE Marks, whose rights terminate upon the Closing pursuant to
this  _Section 5.10_, shall cease use of the GE Name and GE Marks, except as
expressly authorized thereafter by GE.

(c) Promptly after the Closing Date, but in any event no later than sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall make any
reasonably necessary filings with any office, agency or body and take all
other actions reasonably necessary to effect the elimination of any use of
the GE Name and GE Marks from the corporate names, registered names or
registered fictitious names of Altair U.S. and the Business.

 



44 (d) The Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that,
except to the extent expressly provided in the Transitional Trademark License
Agreement, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights
in any of the GE Name and GE Marks and neither the Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights of GE or any
of its Affiliates in or to any of the GE Name and GE Marks.

 

 Section 5.11. _Intellectual Property Cross License_. The parties shall enter into an intellectual property cross license agreement in the form set forth in _Exhibit F_ to this Agreement (the " _Intellectual Property Cross License Agreement_ "). 

 

 Section 5.12. _Further Action Regarding Intellectual Property_. 

 

(a) If, after the Closing Date, the Sellers or the Buyer identifies any
Business Intellectual Property or Business Technology which should have been
but inadvertently was not previously transferred by the Sellers or such
Affiliate, as the case may be, to the Buyer, the Buying Affiliates or Altair
U.S., then to the extent they have the right to do so without paying
compensation to a third party, the Sellers shall promptly transfer such
Business Intellectual Property or Business Technology to the Buyer or its
designated Affiliates for no additional consideration.

 

(b) If, after the Closing Date, the Sellers or the Buyer identifies any GE
Intellectual Property or GE Technology that was (i) transferred by the
Sellers or (ii) owned by Altair U.S. prior to the Closing Date and that was
not transferred to a Seller or any Affiliate prior to the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such GE
Intellectual Property or GE Technology to a Seller or its designated
Affiliates for no additional consideration.

Section 5.13.  _Further Action_. Each of the Sellers and the Buyer (a) shall
execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such
documents and other papers and shall take, or shall cause to be taken, such
further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
including the removal prior to the Closing of Excluded Assets from Altair
U.S. and (b) without limiting the foregoing, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause all of the conditions to the obligations of the other party
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be satisfied
on or prior to the End Date.

Section 5.14. _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) In consideration of the Purchase Price to be received under this
Agreement, for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date (the "
_Restrictive Covenant Period_ "), except as permitted by this _Section 5.14_,
no Seller nor any of the Affiliates of any Seller shall, directly or
indirectly, engage, in whole or in part, in the Covered Business, or
invest in, own, manage, operate or control any Covered Business, anywhere in
the United States and/or any other country in which Altair U.S. or any Seller
or their respective Affiliates conducted the Business or into which the
Business sold products or services as of the Closing Date.

 



45 (b) Each Seller acknowledges that all of the foregoing provisions, including
the restrictions on time and geographical scope set forth in _Section
5.14(a)_ above, are reasonable and necessary to protect Buyer and its
Affiliates from unfair competition, solicitation, and disclosure of
Business/CLC Confidential Information.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.14(a)_ and without
implicitly agreeing that the following activities would be subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.14(a_), nothing in this Agreement shall preclude,
prohibit or restrict any Seller or any of its Affiliates from engaging in any
(i) Financial Services Business, (ii) Existing Business Activities, (iii) De
Minimis Business or (iv) business activity that would otherwise violate
_Section 5.14(a)_ that is acquired from any Person (an " _After-Acquired
Business_ ") or is carried on by any Person that is acquired by or combined
with any Seller or any of its Affiliates, in each case after the Closing Date
(an " _After-Acquired Company_ "); _provided_ , that a Seller or any of its
Affiliates may purchase and acquire an After-Acquired Business or After-
Acquired Company if the primary purpose in making such acquisition is not to
exploit for profit such Covered Business, and _provided_ , _further_ , that
with respect to clause (iv) above, so long as, (A) within fifteen (15) months
after the consummation of the purchase or other acquisition of the After-
Acquired Business or the After-Acquired Company, the Seller or such Affiliate
signs a definitive agreement to dispose of the After-Acquired Business or the
relevant portion of the business or securities of the After-Acquired Business
or the After-Acquired Company that gives rise to the violation of _Section
5.14(a)_ and within eighteen (18) months after the consummation of the
purchase or acquisition of the After-Acquired Business or the After-Acquired
Company, the Seller or such Affiliate disposes of the After-Acquired Business
or the relevant portion of the business or securities of the After-Acquired
Business or the After-Acquired Company that gives rise to the violation of
_Section 5.14(a)_, or (B) at the expiration of the eighteen (18) month
period, the business of the After-Acquired Business or the After-Acquired
Company complies with _Section 5.14(a)_.

(d) This _Section 5.14_ shall cease to be applicable with respect to the
actions of any Seller Party or Affiliate thereof at such time it is no longer
an Affiliate of GE and shall not apply with respect to the actions of any
Person that purchases assets, operations or a business from GE or one of
its Subsidiaries, if such acquiring Person is not an Affiliate of GE after
such transaction is consummated.

Section 5.15.  _Investigation_. The Buyer (a) has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, Altair U.S. and
the Business and (b) has been furnished with or given adequate access to such
information about the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, Altair U.S.
and the Business as it has requested. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in  _Article III_ (as modified by the Disclosure
Schedules), no Seller nor any of their Affiliates makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Altair U.S., the
Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this _Section 5.15_ is intended to limit,
and will not be construed as limiting, the representations and warranties of
the Sellers contained in _Article III_ hereof.

 

Section 5.16. _Assistance with SEC Filings_. In order to assist with any
potential future SEC filing requirements or disclosures in future SEC filings
of the Buyer in connection with the

 



46  transactions contemplated hereby or the financial results of the Business,
the Sellers shall provide such cooperation as the Buyer may reasonably request
in connection with such filing requirements, including, without limitation,
cooperating with the Buyer in the event that the Buyer requests that (a) the
independent accountants with respect to the Financial Statements audit, and
issue an audit opinion with respect to, financial statements in accordance
with GAAP with respect to the Business for the year ended December 31, 2012
and (b) deliver consents to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of
such opinion and financial statements in the SEC filings of the Buyer. The
Buyer shall reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable out-of-pocket independent
accountant expenses incurred by the Sellers in connection with performing
their obligations under this _Section 5.16_.

 

Section 5.17. _Pre-Closing Financial Statements_. Until the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Buyer within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of each month the unaudited monthly financial
information of the Business substantially in the form of Annex A attached
hereto.

 

Section 5.18. _Notification_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, the Sellers or the Buyer, as the case may be (either such
party(ies), the " _Disclosing Party_ "), shall promptly notify the other party
in writing if, to the Knowledge of the Disclosing Party any fact or condition
arises that causes or constitutes a material breach of any of
the representations and warranties of the Disclosing Party made as of the
date of this Agreement (or, as the case may be, would have caused or
constituted a material breach as of the date of this Agreement if such fact or
condition had existed as of the date of this Agreement). If any such fact or
condition requires any change to the schedules prepared by a Disclosing Party
(excluding any changes to schedules that would be immaterial), such Disclosing
Party shall promptly deliver to the other party a supplement to such
schedules specifying such change. In addition, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, the Sellers or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other party of, to their Knowledge, the occurrence of
any breach of any covenant by such party in this _Article V_ or of the
occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of any conditions in
_Article VIII_ impossible or unlikely. No disclosure pursuant to this _Section
5.18_ will prevent or cure any breach of any representation or warranty
(whether made as of the date of this Agreement or made as of the Closing Date)
or covenant set forth herein.

 

Section 5.19. _No Negotiation_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, or, if earlier, the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Article IX_ , the Sellers and their Affiliates shall not, and the Sellers
will instruct their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, or encourage any inquiries or proposals from, participate
in any negotiations with, or provide any non-public information to, any Person
(other than the Buyer and its Affiliates or Governmental Authorities with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) relating to
the acquisition of the Business, in whole or in part, whether directly or
indirectly, through equity purchase, asset purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise.

 

Section 5.20. _Misdirected Payments_. Following the Closing, the Buyer and the
Sellers covenant and agree to promptly remit to the other party (or Affiliate
thereof) any payments received that are owed to the other party (or Affiliate
thereof).

 



47 Section 5.21. _Debt_. At the Closing, any Debt of Altair U.S. will be paid
and satisfied in full.

Section 5.22. _Removal of Certain Transferred Assets_.

 

(a) The Buyer will remove all Transferred Assets located at the China Facility
(the " _Designated Assets_ ") from such location during normal business hours
within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, including disassembling
the Designated Assets as necessary and packing, crating, loading,
transporting, and shipping the Designated Assets. The Buyer will leave the
China Facility in the same condition as found following removal of the
Designated Assets. Any property or personal damage caused by the Buyer or any
of its Representatives in the removal of the Designated Assets shall be
repaired or remedied at Buyers expense. It is understood that all risk of
loss of, or to, the Designated Assets passes to the Buyer as of the Closing
Date, and the Sellers shall have no responsibility for the Designated Assets
following the Closing Date. If for any reason the Buyer fails to take
possession of all of the Designated Assets and remove such Designated Assets
from the China Facility within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date,
then the Sellers may, at their option, store the Designated Assets until the
Buyer accepts delivery and removes such Designated Assets from the China
Facility, whereupon the Buyer shall be liable for all reasonable costs and
expenses related thereto and fees and expenses related to the disassembly of
the Designated Assets. All of the above actions will be at Buyers sole cost
and expense.

(b) The Buyer shall be responsible for the supervision of any of its
Representatives in connection with the removal of the Designated Assets, and
the Buyer agrees that it and its Representatives will abide by all safety
rules of the Sellers and safe practices while on the Sellers property. The
Sellers agree to provide a liaison contact who can assist with answering
safety and procedure questions, and the Sellers will have the right to
oversee, as they see fit, the removal of the Designated Assets by the
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 5.22_.

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Buyer;

 

(b) by either the Sellers or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or prior to January 15, 2014, or such later date as Sellers and the Buyer
may mutually agree in writing (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(b)_ shall
not be available to any party whose failure to comply with or take any action
required to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the
cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior
to such date;

 

(c) by the Sellers if there has been a breach of any covenant or other
agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or any representation or warranty
of the Buyer has been breached, or shall have become untrue or inaccurate
after the date of this Agreement, in each case which breach, untruth or
inaccuracy (i) would result in the failure of the condition set forth in 
_Section 8.01_ to be satisfied (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_ ") and (ii)
has not been (A) waived in writing by the Sellers or (B) cured by Buyer,
within fifteen (15) days after written notice from the Sellers of such
Terminating Buyer Breach is received by Buyer (such notice to describe such
Terminating Buyer Breach in reasonable detail);

 

(d) by the Buyer if there has been a breach of any covenant or other agreement
made by the Sellers in this Agreement, or any representation or warranty of
the Sellers has been breached, or shall have become untrue or inaccurate after
the date of this Agreement, in each case which breach, untruth or inaccuracy
(i) would result in the failure of the condition set forth in  _Section
8.02_ to be satisfied (a " _Terminating Seller Breach_ ") and (ii) has not
been (A) waived in writing by the Buyer or (B) cured by the Sellers, within
fifteen (15) days after written notice from the Buyer of such Terminating
Seller Breach is received by the Sellers (such notice to describe such
Terminating Seller Breach in reasonable detail); or

 

(e) by either the Sellers or the Buyer if any Governmental Order of any
Governmental Authority permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise preventing the consummation of the sale of the Shares or the
Transferred Assets or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
has been issued and becomes final and non-appealable.

 

Section 9.02. _Notice of Termination_. Any party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party or parties, as the case may be, to this
Agreement.

 



51 Section 9.03. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.01_, all rights and obligations of
the parties hereunder shall terminate and no party hereto shall have any
liability to the other parties, except that the obligations of the parties set
forth in  _Section 5.04(a)_, _Section 5.04(b)_ (with respect to the CLC
Information), this _Article IX_ (Termination) and _Article XI_ (General
Provisions) will survive in accordance with their terms; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ shall not relieve
any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement by such party
arising prior to such termination (a " _Pre-Termination Breach_ "); provided,
further, that in the event of any Pre-Termination Breach(es) by a party that

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement, but such waiver of compliance with such agreements or conditions
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party granting such extension
or waiver. Neither the waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a
default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any
of the parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of
this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be
construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or
as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

ARTICLE X

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.01. _Indemnification by GE_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _Article X_
, GE shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, Altair U.S.) and their respective
representatives and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
against, and reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party for, all Losses, whether
or not involving a Third Party Claim, that such Buyer Indemnified Party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in
connection with:

 

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representations or warranties made by GE
in this Agreement or the Seller Closing Certificate;

(ii) any breach or failure by the Sellers or GE to perform any of their
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement;

 



52 (iii) any Excluded Liability (including the failure of the Sellers or GE
to perform or in due course pay and discharge any Excluded Liability);

(iv) any breach or failure by the Sellers or GE to in due course pay and
discharge the indebtedness of Altair UK as required by _Section 5(b)_ of
_Exhibit C_ ; or

 

(v) any brokerage or finders fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any Person
with any Sellers or any Affiliates thereof (or any Person acting on their
behalf) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:

 

(i) GE shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Buyer
Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party for, any
Losses pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ until the aggregate amount of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties Losses exceeds $2,650,000 (the " _Deductible_ "),
after which the Sellers shall be obligated for all Losses of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ in excess of the Deductible;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations on indemnification set forth in
this clause (i) shall not apply to any indemnification claim brought as a
result of the inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty made by the
Sellers in _Section 3.01_ (Incorporation, Qualification and Authority of the
Sellers), _Section 3.02_ (Capitalization of Altair U.S.), clauses (a) and
(b) of _Section 3.03_ (No Conflict), _Section 3.04_ (Consents and
Approvals), clause (b) of _Section 3.10_ (Assets), _Section 3.16_
(Brokers), clause (b) of _Section 3.17_ (Real Property) (other than the
Title Rep to the extent terminated in accordance with _Section 3.17(b)_),
_Section 3.18_ (Taxes) and _Section 3.20(a)_ (Questionable Payments and
Trade Regulation) (such representations and warranties, the " _Fundamental
Representations_ ");

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of GE under _Section
10.01(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed $31,800,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to any indemnification claim
brought as a result of the inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental
Representation or _Section 3.10(a)_ (Assets);

(iii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of GE under _Section
10.01(a)(i)_ and _Section 10.01(a)(ii)_ shall in no event exceed the
aggregate amount of net proceeds actually received by GE pursuant to this
Agreement; and

 

(iv) GEs indemnification obligations in respect of a claim by any Buyer
Indemnified Person arising out of any inaccuracy or breach by GE of the first
sentence of _Section 3.11(c)_ (any such breach, an " _Applicable Infringement
Claim_ "), shall be limited as provided in this clause (iv) as follows:

 

(A) GEs aggregate indemnification obligations in respect of all Applicable
Infringement Claims shall be subject to the Deductible and the Cap;

 



53 (B) GEs indemnification obligations in respect of any
Applicable Infringement Claim shall be limited to 50% of the Losses arising
out of an Applicable Infringement Claim until such time as GE has paid
$10,000,000 above the Deductible in respect of such Applicable Infringement
Claim;

 

(C) Once the $10,000,000 threshold in clause (B) above has been satisfied,
GEs indemnification obligations in respect of the Applicable Infringement
Claim shall be limited to 25% of the Losses arising out of the Applicable
Infringement Claim; and

 

(D) For the avoidance of doubt, the Losses allocated to GE in accordance with
the framework set forth in this  _Section 10.01(b)(iv)_ will be utilized for
purposes of the determination of the applicability of the Deductible and Cap,
not the total Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons in connection
with any such Applicable Infringement Breach.

For the purposes of clauses (iv)(B) and (C) above, multiple Applicable
Infringement Claims brought by a plaintiff and its Affiliates (regardless of
the timing, subject matter or jurisdiction of such claims) will be aggregated
and treated as a single claim for purposes of determining whether the
$10,000,000 threshold has been satisfied.

 

Section 10.02. _Indemnification by the Buyer_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _Article X_
, the Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless GE and its Affiliates
and its representatives and agents (collectively, the " _GE Indemnified
Parties_ ") against, and reimburse any GE Indemnified Party for, all Losses,
whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, that such GE Indemnified Party
may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in
connection with:

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representations or warranties made by the
Buyer in this Agreement or the Buyer Closing Certificate;

(ii) any breach or failure by the Buyer to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement;

(iii) any Assumed Liability (including the failure of the Buyer or its
Affiliates to perform or in due course pay and discharge any Assumed
Liability) (provided, however, that this clause (iii) will not be construed to
limit the right of a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.01(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty that is related to an Assumed Liability); or

 

(iv) any brokerage or finders fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any Person
with the Buyer or any Affiliates thereof (or any Person acting on their
behalf) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



54 Section 10.03. _Notification of Claims_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ "), shall promptly notify the party or parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
claim asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that
notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable Claims Period specified in _Section 10.07_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. (For the avoidance of doubt,
this provision shall not apply to claims under the Tax Matters Agreement.)

(b) If an Indemnifying Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense and through counsel of its choice if such
Indemnifying Party gives notice in writing of its election to do so to the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of notice from
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party so elects to undertake any
such defense against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense at its own expense, except as set forth in the
following sentence. In such event, an Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys expense if the named
parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party
shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to
exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake such
defense, the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and
consultants of recognized standing and competence after consultation with the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates, members, officers, agents and employees to, reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, no settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim may be
made by the Indemnifying Party without the consent of any Indemnified Party
unless (i) the settlement or judgment involves only monetary payments, (ii)
the Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid all amounts arising out of
such settlement or judgment promptly following the effectiveness of such
settlement or judgment and (iii) the Indemnifying Party obtains, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete release of
any Indemnified Party affected by such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within the time
period set forth in this _Section 10.03(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to defend and control such Third Party Claim but shall not consent
to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, such Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



55 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person reasonably
determines that a Third Party Claim is reasonably likely to materially affect
the Business acquired hereunder or such Indemnified Person in an adverse
manner other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be
entitled to indemnification in full under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right
to defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnifying
Person will not be bound by any determination of any such Third Party Claim
so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement
with respect thereto effected without its consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) With respect to any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this _Section 10.03_: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed in all
material respects of the status of such Third Party Claim and any related
proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its
own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in
good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third Party Claim.

(e) In the event that an Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim
pursuant to _Section 10.03(a)_ that does not involve a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party, specifying (to the extent then known by the Indemnified
Party) the amount of such claim and any relevant facts and circumstances
relating thereto. The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party
with reasonable access to its books and records, properties, assets,
personnel, agents and advisors for the purpose of allowing the Indemnifying
Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any such claim, subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement and/or _Section 5.02_ hereof, as applicable,
and provided that such access shall not be provided with respect to any such
information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or other applicable
privilege or to the extent such access will violate applicable Law. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith
regarding the resolution of any disputed claims of liability. Promptly
following the final determination of the amount of any disputed claims by
agreement between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or final
judicial action, the Indemnifying Party promptly shall pay the amount of any
such finally determined liability to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer or
check made payable to the order of the Indemnified Party.(f) Notwithstanding
anything contained to the contrary, in the event of any Third Party
Claim arising out of any Applicable Infringement Claim, Buyer shall have the
exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but GE
will not be bound by any determination of such Third Party Claim so defended
for purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement with respect
thereto effected by Buyer without GEs consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 10.04. _Exclusive Remedies_. Except (i) with respect to the matters
covered by _Sections 2.09_ through  _2.11_ , or (ii) for any action or claim
based upon fraud, the Sellers and the Buyer acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this _Article X_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of any GE Indemnified Party and any
Buyer Indemnified Party, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses
from claims for breach of

 



56  contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise)
that it may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result
of, or in connection with, any breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement by the Buyer or the Sellers, respectively, or any failure by
Buyer or a Seller, respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement set forth herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will
limit any partys rights to injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby as provided in _Section 11.13_ hereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit or
restrict any Person who is a party to any agreement or document to be entered
pursuant to the terms hereof to recover Losses or any other legal or equitable
relief from any other Person who is a party to any such agreement in
connection with the breach of such agreement by such other Person pursuant to
the terms thereof.

 

Section 10.05. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. The Sellers and the
Buyer agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, that with respect to the indemnification obligations in this
Agreement, (a) each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis,
(b) all Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance proceeds which have
been actually recovered by the Indemnified Party (which insurance proceeds
will be net of any expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates in connection with recovering such insurance proceeds)
in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification, and
(c) in no event shall the Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified
Party for any (i) punitive damages or (ii) damages that are not a
reasonably foreseeable result or consequence of a breach by the Indemnifying
Party (except to the extent in any such case that any such damages are payable
in connection with any Third Party Claim). The Buyer shall not make any claim
for indemnification under this _Article X_ to the extent that that the
Damages in question would duplicate any amount that has been taken into
account in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.09_ through  _Section 2.11_.

Section 10.06. _Insurance Remedies_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party (or any of
their respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, Altair U.S.) is at
any time entitled to recover under any insurance policy any amount in respect
of any matter giving rise to a Loss (whether before or after a Seller has made
a payment to an Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder and in respect thereof),
the Buyer shall (and shall cause its applicable Affiliate (including, after
the Closing, Altair U.S.) to) (a) promptly notify the Sellers and provide such
information as the Sellers may require relating to such right of recovery and
the steps taken or to be taken by the Buyer in connection therewith, (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to submit any claims related to such Losses
for recovery under any applicable insurance policy, and (c) keep the Sellers
reasonably informed of the progress of any action taken in respect thereof.
Thereafter, any claim against the Sellers shall be limited (in addition to the
limitations on the liability of the Sellers and their Affiliates referred to
in this Agreement) to the amount by which the Losses suffered by the Buyer
Indemnified Party exceed the amounts so actually recovered by the Buyer
Indemnified Party (or any such respective Affiliate (including, after
the Closing, Altair U.S.)) under any such insurance policy. If the Buyer
Indemnified Parties recover any amounts in respect of any such Losses under
any insurance policy at any time after the Sellers have paid all 

 



57  or a portion of such Losses to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article X_ , the Buyer shall, or shall cause such Buyer
Indemnified Parties to promptly pay over to the Sellers the amount so
received (to the extent previously paid by the Sellers).

Section 10.07. _Claims Period_. The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on
the date hereof and terminate as follows:

(a) with respect to Losses arising under (i) _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ with
respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty in
_Sections 3.01_ (Incorporation, Qualification and Authority of the Sellers) or
_3.02_ (Capitalization of Altair U.S.) or (ii) _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ with
respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty in
_Section 4.06_ (Securities Matters), the Claims Period shall continue
indefinitely;

 

(b) with respect to Losses arising under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ with respect
to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made in
_Section 3.16_ (Brokers), _Section 3.18_ (Taxes) and _Section 3.20(a)_
(Questionable Payments and Trade Regulation), the Claims Period shall
terminate on the date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations;

(c) with respect to Losses arising under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ with respect
to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made in the
first sentence of _Section 3.11(c)_ or _Section 3.12_ (Environmental
Matters), the Claims Period shall terminate on the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date;

(d) with respect to Losses arising under  _Section 10.01(a)(ii)_ or _Section
10.02(a)(ii)_, the Claims Period shall terminate on the date of the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations;

 

(e) with respect to Losses arising under _Sections 10.01(a)(iii)_ ,
_10.01(a)(iv)_ , _10.01(a)(v)_ , _10.02(a)(iii)_ or  _10.02(a)(iv)_ , the
Claims Period shall continue indefinitely; and

(f) with respect to all other Losses arising hereunder, the Claims Period
shall terminate on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last
day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been
properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claims shall not
have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms
hereof.

 

Section 10.08. _No Double Materiality_. For purposes of calculating the amount
of Losses to which a GE Indemnified Party or a Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled under this _Article X_ , but not for purposes of determining whether
a representation or warranty has been breached, the terms "material,"
"materiality," and "material adverse effect" will be disregarded.

Section 11.03. _Public Announcements_. No party or Affiliate of such party
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or public
announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media in respect of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby without the prior written consent of GE and Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (a) the parties agree that it is contemplated that (i) Buyer
will issue an initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
(ii) Buyer will issue a press release with respect to the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby promptly following the Closing, and (b)
nothing in this _Section 11.03_ shall (i) limit any party from making any

applicable Laws or the requirements of any national securities exchange
to make, issue or release, or (ii) limit Buyer or GE or its Affiliates from
making any disclosures that it deems necessary or advisable to be made in
filings with the SEC.

 

Section 11.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or
as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence or
upon such determination that any other term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated
as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. In addition, if it
is determined that any of the restrictive covenants, or any part thereof, set
forth in _Section 5.14(a)_ hereof are unenforceable because of the duration
of such provision, the geographical area covered thereby, or any other
determination of unreasonableness of the provision, the court making such
determination shall have the power to reduce the duration, area or scope of
such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be
enforceable and shall be enforced.

 



60 Section 11.05. _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein and therein, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute
the entire agreement of the Sellers and the Buyer with respect to the subject
matter contained herein and therein and supersede all prior agreements,
undertakings, and understandings, both written and oral, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement (which will terminate at Closing except to the
extent set forth in _Section 5.04(a)_), between or on behalf of the GE
Entities and the Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise by any party without the prior written consent
of the other party(ies), except that each of the Buyer and the Sellers may
assign any or all of its respective rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any of their controlled Affiliates, _provided_ that no such
assignment shall release any Party from any liability or obligation under this
Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their permitted
successors and assigns.

Section 11.07. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article
X_ with respect to GE Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, or any
Ancillary Agreements, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.08. _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement may be amended or modified except by a written instrument signed by
all the parties to such agreement.

Section 11.09. _Disclosure Schedules_. Any disclosure with respect to
a Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for
other Sections of the Disclosure to the extent that such disclosure sets forth
facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure would be
reasonably apparent to a reader of such disclosure. Matters reflected in any
Section of the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters
of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter
in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement.

Section 11.10. _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement (and any claims, causes of action or disputes that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate hereto, to the transactions contemplated
hereby, to the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, or to the
inducement of any party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute
or otherwise) shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance, in each case without reference to any
conflict of Law rules that might lead to the application of the Laws of any
other jurisdiction.

 



61 (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that any claims, causes of action or
disputes that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement to
the transactions contemplated hereby, to the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, or to the inducement of any party to enter herein, whether
for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated
on common law, statute or otherwise, shall be resolved only in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and the appellate courts having jurisdiction
of appeals in such courts (the " _Delaware Courts_ "). In that context, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party irrevocably and
unconditionally:

 

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts, and agrees that
all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined in the
Delaware Courts;

 

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in the Delaware
Courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue or jurisdiction of any such Action in the Delaware Courts or that such
Action was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same;

 

(iii) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in _Section 11.02_; and

 

(iv) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. EACH PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.11_.

 

Section 11.12. _Bulk Sales Laws_. The Buyer and the Sellers each hereby waive
compliance by the Sellers with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk
transfer" or similar laws of any state or any jurisdiction outside the United
States.

 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
the breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other
party hereto and that neither

 



62  party will have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of the
Sellers under this Agreement, including the Sellers obligation to sell the
Transferred Assets and the Shares to the Buyer, the Buyers obligation to
purchase and acquire the Transferred Assets and the Shares from the GE
Entities, the Buyers obligations under _Section 5.06_, the obligations of
Sellers and their Affiliates under _Sections 5.04_ , _5.09_ and _5.14_
hereof, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction, and/or appropriate injunctive relief in
connection therewith, without the requirement to post any bond or other
undertaking, to compel performance of such partys obligations or to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any
other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.
Each of the parties waives and releases any and all tort claims and causes of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

Section 11.14. _Rules of Construction_. Interpretation of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements shall be governed by the following rules of
construction: (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural
and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be held to include the other
gender as the context requires; (b) references to the terms Article, Section,
paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to the Articles, Sections,
paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules of or to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified; (c) the terms "hereof", "herein", "hereby", "hereto", and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule, Annexes and Exhibits hereto; (d) references to "dollars"

similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean including without
limitation, unless otherwise specified; (f) the word "or" shall not be
exclusive; (g) references to "written or "in writing" include in electronic
form; (h) provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive events and
transactions; (i) each of the Parties hereto have participated in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and if
an ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties thereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
burdening any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in
this Agreement; (j) a reference to any Person includes such Persons
successors and permitted assigns; (k) any reference to days means calendar
days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and (l) when calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is
to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded, and if the last
day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day.

Section 11.15. _Counterparts_. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement may
be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties to each
such agreement in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by facsimile or by .pdf or
similar imaging transmission, shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of any such Agreement.

 



63 Section 11.16. _Language; Prevailing Documents_. This Agreement has been, and
the Ancillary Agreements will be, prepared in the English language. In case
of any conflict or inconsistency between the English language version of such
documents and any translation thereof made for any purpose, the English
language version will govern the interpretation and construction of such
documents, and for any and all other purposes, except as may be required by
applicable Law. In the event that any of the terms of this Agreement conflict
with any of the terms of the Business Transfer Agreements, the terms of this
Agreement will prevail. All matters relating to the transfer of the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities from the applicable Sellers, on the
one hand, to the relevant Buying Affiliates, on the other hand, which are not
expressly regulated under the relevant Ancillary Agreements, are deemed to be
regulated by this Agreement.
