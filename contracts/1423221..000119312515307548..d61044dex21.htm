any matters with respect to the Closing Items which Parent is disputing as a
result of the matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, or any disputed matters
arising out of the foregoing) and any such resolution shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. If, at the conclusion of the
Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute, then each of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall submit all items remaining in dispute to a
nationally or regionally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Stockholders Representative (the " _Valuation Firm_ ") for
resolution by delivering within 10 calendar days after the expiration of the

the Stockholders Representative in proportion to the proximity of their
respective positions to the determination of the Valuation Firm, with such
division being determined by the Valuation Firm (it being understood that the
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to pay all such fees out of
the Expense Holdback Amount). The Valuation Firm shall determine, based solely
on the submissions by the Stockholders Representative and Parent, and not by
independent review, only those issues set forth in the Dispute Notice that
remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any such disputed item

 



17  which is equal to or between the final values proposed by Parent and the
Stockholders Representative in their respective submissions. The Parties
shall request that the Valuation Firm make a decision with respect to all
disputed items within 30 calendar days after the submissions of the Parties,
and in any event as promptly as practicable. The final determination with
respect to all dispute items shall be set forth in a written statement by the
Valuation Firm delivered to Parent and the Stockholders Representative and
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the Stockholders. Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall promptly execute any reasonable
engagement letter requested by the Valuation Firm and shall each cooperate
fully with the Valuation Firm, including by providing the information, data
and work papers used by each Party to prepare and/or calculate the Closing
Items, making its personnel and accountants available to explain any such
information, data or work papers, so as to enable the Valuation Firm to make
such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable.

 

(d) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price
(such excess amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then, within three Business
Days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_, Parent shall pay (without interest) to each Stockholder who
has delivered a Letter of Transmittal and each Warrantholder, in each case by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such Stockholders or
Warrantholders account set forth in the Funds Flow, the aggregate portion of
the Excess Amount that such Stockholder or Warrantholder, as applicable,
is entitled to in accordance with _Section 2.5(g)_. Upon such payment of the
Excess Amount by Parent, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the
Stockholders and Warrantholders accounts set forth in the Funds Flow an
aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount
allocated among the Stockholders and Warrantholders in accordance with
_Section 2.5(g)_.

 

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price (such
shortfall amount, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall, within three Business Days after the Final Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the account designated
by Parent an aggregate amount equal to the Shortfall Amount from the funds
available in the Escrow Account (i.e., first from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount and, if the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount is less than
the Shortfall Amount, such deficit from the Indemnity Holdback Amount). If
the Shortfall Amount is less than the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback
Amount (such difference, the " _Remaining Holdback Amount_ "), then Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall include in such joint written
instructions that the Escrow Agent release to the Stockholders and
Warrantholders accounts set forth in the Funds Flow an aggregate amount equal
to the Remaining Holdback Amount allocated among the Stockholders and
Warrantholders in accordance with _Section 2.5(g)_.

(f) Unless the Stockholders Representative determines otherwise, on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Stockholders Representative shall
pay to the Stockholders and Warrantholders an aggregate amount equal to the
remaining Expense Holdback Amount allocated among the Stockholders and
Warrantholders in accordance with _Section 2.5(g)_.

 



18 (g) All amounts payable to the Stockholders and Warrantholders pursuant to
this  _Section 2.5_ shall be paid as if such amounts had been included in
the Closing Merger Consideration.

(h) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

Section 2.6 _No Further Rights of Transfers_. At and after the Effective
Time, (a) each Stockholder shall cease to have any rights as an equityholder
of the Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law and except for
the right of each Stockholder to deliver a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal in exchange for payment of the portion of the Merger
Consideration such Stockholder is entitled to pursuant to this Agreement in
the manner and at the times set forth herein and (b) no transfer of Shares
shall be made on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. Immediately
after the Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed.

 

Section 2.7 _Post-Closing Payments; Section 262 Notices; Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
mail to any Stockholder that has not theretofore executed the Stockholder
Approval, an information statement describing the transactions contemplated
hereby as provided in Section 228 of the Delaware Corporation Law and request
that such Stockholder execute a joinder to the Stockholder Approval
adopting this Agreement and waive any appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the Delaware Corporation Law. Adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders
shall not restrict the ability of the Companys board of directors to
terminate or amend this Agreement to the extent not prohibited under Section
251(d) of the Delaware Corporation Law.

(b) All Stockholders that have delivered a duly-executed Letter of
Transmittal on or prior to the Closing Date shall be paid at the Closing and
any Stockholder that delivers a duly-executed Letter of Transmittal after the
Closing Date shall be paid (without interest) as promptly as practicable upon
delivery of such duly-executed Letter of Transmittal.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which are held by Stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly demanded and
are entitled to appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration. Such Stockholders instead shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, solely to the extent such
Stockholders have perfected and not withdrawn and are otherwise entitled to
appraisal in accordance with the DGCL. If any such Stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal of such Stockholders Shares in accordance with the DGCL
or otherwise withdraws such Stockholders demand for appraisal, such
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, without any interest thereon, the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in this
_Article II_. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any
such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Closing pursuant to the

 



19  DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

ARTICLE III

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except as set forth on the Schedules delivered in connection with this
Agreement the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

Section 3.1 _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. The
Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and,
if applicable, in good standing (or equivalent, if applicable) under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of organization and, as of the date hereof, each has all
requisite power (corporate or otherwise) and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (or equivalent), if applicable, in each
jurisdiction where the conduct of the business of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary, as the case may be, requires such license or qualification, except
in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in
good standing (or equivalent), if applicable, would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



21 Section 3.2 _Authorization; Noncontravention_.

 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company have been duly authorized and approved in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company. No other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company (other
than the Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger as
required by the DGCL). The Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock required to
approve and adopt this Agreement and approve and consummate the Merger. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general equitable
principles.

by the Company on the Closing Date of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, (i) conflict with any provisions of the Companys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) subject to the filings required
under the Antitrust Laws and the consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings and notices referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ and
_Section 3.4(b)_, conflict with or result in a breach of or default
under (including a breach due to the failure to notify or obtain the prior
consent or waiver of any Person) any Material Contract, result in, require or
permit the creation or imposition of any Lien upon the assets of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or result in the acceleration of or create in any
party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel any contract to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective assets is bound or
subject or (iii) subject to the filings required under the Antitrust Laws and
the consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and notices
referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ and  _Section 3.4(b)_, contravene any
domestic or foreign Law or any Order currently in effect and applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and were not issued
in violation of any preemptive rights. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_
and under the Stockholders Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to any outstanding option, warrant, call, put,
right of first refusal or subscription agreement which obligates it to issue,
sell or transfer, or repurchase or redeem any shares of the capital stock, 

 



22  membership interests or other equity interest in the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary directly or
indirectly owns, controls or has any ownership interest in any Person other
than the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Assuming any filings required under the
Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, no consent of or filing with any Governmental Entity,
which has not been received or made, is required with respect to the Company
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger, and ii)
the consents or filings set forth on _Schedule 3.4_.

") or any benefit or compensation plan program or arrangement sponsored,
maintained or administered by a Governmental Entity or required to be

collectively, the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "). _Schedule 3.10(a)(ii)_
hereto also sets forth a true and complete list of each material Non-U.S.
Employee Benefit Plan, other than any benefit or compensation plan program or

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan and Non-U.S. Employee Benefit Plan has been
maintained, operated, and administered in accordance with its terms, and in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Within the
last three years, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
participated in any voluntary compliance or self-correction programs
established by the IRS or the Department of Labor with respect to any

entered into a closing agreement with the IRS with respect to the form or
operation of any Employee Benefit Plan for which all liabilities and
obligations to such Employee Benefit Plan and any corresponding participants
and beneficiaries have not been satisfied.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, has within the last six
years had an obligation to contribute to, or any liability, including any

Company Subsidiary to determine, measure and track each such entitys full-
time employees for purposes of the ACA.

(f) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (a " _Qualified Plan_ ") is so qualified both as to form
and operation and all necessary approvals, including a favorable

Subsidiary would have any material liability or obligation (except as has
already been satisfied).

(h) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
Actions (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
asserted or instituted against any Employee Benefit Plan or any Non-U.S.
Employee Benefit Plan or such Employee Benefit Plans related trust or against
any fiduciary of an Employee Benefit Plan with respect to the operation of
such Employee Benefit Plan that would result in material liability to the
Company or a Company Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
investigations or audits of any Employee Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Employee
Benefit Plan by any Governmental Entity currently pending, and there have
been no such investigations or audits that have been concluded that resulted
in any liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary which has not been
fully discharged.

 

(i) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(i) no termination, retention,
severance, or similar benefit will become payable, and no employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary will be entitled to any bonus or additional
benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits
under any Employee Benefit Plan, Non-U.S. Employee Benefit Plan or other
contract, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(whether or not the employees prior, concurrent or future termination would
constitute a separate trigger for such benefit).

 

(j) All material contributions and other payments that are due and owing to
each Employee Benefit Plan and each Non-U.S. Employee Benefit Plan on or
before the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such plan, ERISA, the
Code or other applicable Law have been timely made or properly accrued. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have timely made all material
contributions required to be made by them to any benefit or compensation plan
program or arrangement sponsored, maintained or administered by a Governmental
Entity or required to be maintained or contributed to by Law on behalf of
non-U.S. workers.

 

(k) Each Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
at all times been operated and maintained in operational and documentary
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.
No payment to be made under any Employee Benefit Plan is or has been
subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. _Schedule
3.10(k)_ identifies each Employee Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code.

 



27 (l) No Employee Benefit Plan has at any time held any employer securities.

 

(m) The representations and warranties set forth in this _Section 3.10_ are
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties in respect of employee
benefit matters and the Employee Benefit Plans and Non-U.S. Employee Benefit
Plan.

Section 3.11 _Labor and Employment Matters_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.11(a)_ , neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining agreement relating
to employees thereof. There are no strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or other
material labor disputes pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no ongoing or threatened union organizing activities
with respect to employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There have

behalf of any of the employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary within
the three years prior to the execution of this Agreement.

its Representatives have experience as investors in equity interests and other
securities of companies such as the ones being transferred pursuant to this

Parent hereby agrees that Parent shall, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, (a) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusion

initial participation that begins during the New Plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
any right to continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any
specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any New Plan, Employee Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Employee
Benefit Plan. The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ are not intended, and
shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other

subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for any obligations arising under
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. With respect to any
Company Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are subject to a
works council, labor or collective bargaining agreement, Parent shall, and

member, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (collectively, with such persons heirs, executors or

indemnification, expense reimbursement and exculpation to the extent provided
in the governing documents of the Company and each Company Subsidiary in

Provisions shall affect in any manner the Indemnified Persons rights, or the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys, as the case may be, obligations, with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Closing.

(b) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain and maintain in
effect for a period of six years thereafter, (i) a tail policy to the current

Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing, and which tail policy
shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the
coverage currently provided by such current policy and (ii) "run off" coverage
as provided by the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries fiduciary and
employee benefits policies, in each case, covering those Persons who are
covered on the date hereof by such policies and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the
coverage provided under the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing
policies (collectively, the " _Tail Policy_ "). No claims made under or in
respect of such Tail Policy shall be settled (to the extent the Tail Policy
gives the Parties the power to prevent such settlement) without the
prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Person, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 5.6  _Press Release_. Any press or other public release or
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby

information concerning its business and the timing and type of disclosure is
ultimately within its sole discretion. Except to the extent required by
applicable Law and in connection with the procurement of any necessary
consents, approvals, payoff letters and similar documentation, the Parties
shall keep the terms of this Agreement confidential (it being understood
that the Parties may disclose such terms to their respective Representatives
pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent necessary
in connection with consummating the transactions contemplated hereby so long
as such persons agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential);
provided, however, that (i) the Company may make announcements to its
employees, customers and other business relations to the extent such it
determines in good faith that such announcement is necessary or advisable and
(ii) Olympus Partners may provide general information about the subject matter

raising, marketing, informational or reporting activities.

 



47 Section 5.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each Party shall be liable for and pay all of its own costs and

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Parent will prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to
be timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
that are due after the Closing Date. Tax Returns with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past custom and
practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
required by applicable law. With respect to any overpayment of Tax or Tax
refund of the Company or any Company Subsidiary arising from any such Tax
Return, Parent shall have the right to claim and receive any refund or
overpayment of Tax (rather than applying any such amount to future periods).
The Company and each Company Subsidiary may, within the sole discretion of
Parent, make an election to affirmatively waive any carryback of any net
operating loss, capital loss or credit on any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

(ii) For the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing, other than
the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Parent will cause the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to carry on their business only in the ordinary
course in the same manner as heretofore conducted. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the Company and Company Subsidiaries will elect with the
relevant Taxing Authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the
last day of a taxable period of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(iii) To the extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to the
preparation of Tax Returns Parent shall determine in its discretion whether
the Transaction Tax Deductions will be treated as properly allocable, and
deductible with respect, to the Pre-Closing Tax Period or the taxable period
ending after the Closing Date.

 



48 (b) _Tax Contests_. Parent shall notify the Stockholders Representative
within fifteen (15) days of receiving written notice of any Tax Contest
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for which the Stockholders may have an obligation to indemnify the Parent
Indemnified Parties hereunder, provided, however that failure or delay on the
part of Parent in so notifying the Stockholders Representative shall affect
the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties hereunder only to the extent that
such failure or delay has a prejudicial effect or adversely affects other
rights available to the Stockholders with respect to such Tax Contest. The
Stockholders Representative shall have the right to control any Tax Contest
relating to any tax period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that ends
on or before the Closing Date to the extent that the Stockholders are required
to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties hereunder and the anticipated
Losses are not reasonably likely to exceed the balance of the
Indemnity Holdback Amount (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Contest_ "). If the
Stockholders Representative elects to control such Pre-Closing Tax Contest,
(i) Parent shall have the right to participate at its own expense in any such
Pre-Closing Tax Contest, and (ii) the Stockholders Representative shall not,
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, agree to any settlement with
respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Contest. Parent shall control the handling,
disposition, and settlement of any such Pre-Closing Tax Contest the
Stockholders Representative elects not to control and any Tax Contest the
Stockholders Representative is not entitled to control for which the
Stockholders may have an obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties hereunder, provided that (x) the Stockholders Representative shall
have the right to participate at its own expense in any such Pre-Closing Tax
Contest or Tax Contest, and (y) Parent shall not, without the Stockholders
Representatives prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, agree to any settlement with
respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Contest or Tax Contest if such settlement
would cause the Stockholders to incur a material indemnification obligation to
the Parent Indemnified Parties hereunder. The Stockholders
Representative shall promptly notify the Parent if the Stockholders
Representative decides to control the defense or settlement of any Pre-Closing
Tax Contest that it is entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement. Parent
shall have the sole right to control any Tax Contest relating to any Straddle
Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (a " _Straddle Period Tax
Contest_ "); _provided_ , that with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Contest
the anticipated Losses of which are reasonable likely to cause the
Stockholders to incur a material indemnification obligation to the Parent
Indemnified Parties hereunder (1) the Stockholders Representative shall have
the right to participate at its own expense in any such Straddle Period Tax
Contest, and (2) Parent shall not, without the Stockholders Representatives
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, agree to any settlement with respect to such Straddle
Period Tax Contest.

(c) _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall reasonably cooperate as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any Party, in connection with the filing of all Tax Returns of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary

 



49  for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Parent and Stockholders Representative agree
(A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company and Company Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Parent or Stockholders Representative, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B)
to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, Parent or Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, shall
allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records. Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall, upon the others request, use
their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Any real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax,
stock transfer tax, documentary, sales, use, registration, or other similar
Tax and fees (including any penalties and interest) imposed on the Company and
any Company Subsidiary as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne and paid 50% by
the Stockholders, on the one hand, and 50% by Parent, on the other hand, when
due, and all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the Party required to file such
Tax Returns under applicable Law. Each of Parent and the Stockholders will
indemnify and hold the other Party harmless against any Transfer Taxes. Parent
and the Stockholders Representative agree to cooperate with each other in the
filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly
supplying any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to
complete such returns.

 

(e) _Straddle Period Taxes_. If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
is permitted but not required under applicable Law to treat the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period, the Parties shall so treat the Closing
Date. Where such treatment is not permitted, for purposes of determining the
liability for Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
a Straddle Period,

(i) Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, or imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), and attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming
that the applicable entity (and any entity or arrangement taxed as a
partnership or other pass through entity in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest, and any controlled foreign corporation
within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code in which a Company or any
Company Subsidiary is an owner) had a taxable year or period which ended at
the close of the Closing Date and by determining the Taxes due for such period
based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on
the Closing Date;

 



50  provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
period beginning after the Closing Date (in proportion to the number of days
in each period); and

 

(ii) Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be apportioned by assuming that
an equal portion of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period is allocable to
each day in such Straddle Period.

 

(f) _Tax Elections_. Parent will not make any election under Section 338 of
the Code or Section 336 of the Code (or any similar provisions under state,
local, or foreign law) with respect to the acquisition of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Parent will not take any action with respect to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

 

(g) _Amended Tax Returns; Tax Elections_. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, with respect to any Tax period of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that ends on or before the Closing Date, Parent will not, without
the Stockholders Representatives prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), cause or permit the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to (i) amend any Tax Return that relates in
whole or in part to any such Tax period, (ii) make any Tax election that has
retroactive effect to any such Tax period, (iii) voluntarily approach
any Taxing Authority with respect to any such Tax period, provided however,
that Parent may (or may cause the Company or any Company Subsidiary to)
respond to inquiries initiated by a Taxing Authority, including those that may
result from filing of Tax Returns or payment of Taxes with respect to a Tax
period ending after the Closing Date, or (iv) extend the statute of
limitations with respect to any such Tax period. The covenants in this
_Section 5.9(g)_ shall terminate on the first anniversary of the Closing
Date.

(h) _Compensatory Payments_. Parent agrees that any amounts to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement that is treated as compensation for income tax
purposes may be paid to the Company or Company Subsidiary (at such time upon
which such payment is due), which in turn, shall pay the applicable recipient
such amounts through the Companys or Company Subsidiarys payroll, less
applicable withholding Taxes, and will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in respect of which such
withholding was made.

 

(i) _Refunds_. Except with respect to Transfer Taxes, any refund of Taxes of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether in the form of cash received
or a credit or offset against Taxes otherwise payable), including any interest
received from a Taxing Authority with respect thereto, that is attributable to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
the property of Parent. If any such refund is received by a Party other than
Parent, the Party receiving such refund shall pay over such refund to Parent
within ten

 



51  (10) days after receipt thereof from the applicable Governmental Entity.
Each of the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall be entitled to one-
half of any refund of Transfer Taxes. 

(j) _2014 Tax Return_. Prior to Closing (and in no event later than September
15, 2015) the Company will file the 2014 consolidated federal income tax
return (Form 1120) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and pay all Taxes due in connection therewith. The Stockholders
Representative shall furnish Parent with a copy of such filed
return (including schedules and statements attached thereto) within five
calendar days after the return is filed.

Section 5.10  _Investigation by Parent; No Other Representations; Non-
Reliance of Parent_. Parent and its Affiliates have substantial familiarity
with the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and fully
understand the risks inherent therewith. Furthermore, Parent (for itself and
on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) has conducted an independent
investigation, verification, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, technology
and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and Parent, its
Affiliates and their advisors and Representatives have had access to the
personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement,
Parent has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and
analysis and not on any factual representations or opinions of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, any Stockholder or any Warrantholder or any of their
respective Representatives or any other Person, except for the specific
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in _Article III_
, in each case, as qualified by the Schedules (the " _Express
Representations_ "). Parent (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and
Representatives and each of their successors and assigns): (a) except for the
Express Representations, specifically acknowledges that none of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, any Stockholder, any Warrantholder or any other Person
is making and has not made any representation or warranty, expressed or
implied, at law or in equity, in respect of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, assets, liabilities,
operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise), including with
respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of any
assets, the nature or extent of any liabilities, the prospects of the
business, the effectiveness or the success of any operations, or the accuracy
or completeness of any confidential information memoranda, management
presentations, projections, documents, material or other information
(financial or otherwise) regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
furnished to Parent or its Affiliates or their Representatives or made
available to Parent, its Affiliates or their Representatives in any data
rooms, management presentations or in any other manner or form in expectation
of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) except
for the Express Representations, specifically and irrevocably disclaims that
it is relying upon or has relied upon any such other representations or
warranties that may have been made by any Person, and acknowledges that the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Stockholders, the Warrantholders and
their respective Affiliates hereby specifically disclaim any such other
representation or warranty made by any Person; (c) specifically disclaims any
obligation or duty by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Stockholders,
the Warrantholders and their respective Affiliates or any other Person to
make any disclosures of fact not required to be disclosed by the Express
Representations; and (d) specifically acknowledges Parent is entering

 



52  into this Agreement and acquiring the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
subject only to the Express Representations. Without limiting the generality
of any of the foregoing, (i) none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
the Stockholders, the Warrantholders or any of their Affiliates makes any
representation or warranty regarding any third party beneficiary rights or
other rights which Parent or its Affiliates might claim under any studies,
reports, tests or analyses prepared by any third parties for the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, even if the same were made
available for review by Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives;
and (ii) none of the documents, information or other materials provided to
Parent at any time or in any format by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
the Stockholders, the Warrantholders or their Affiliates or Representatives
constitute legal advice, and Parent waives all rights to assert that it
received any legal advice from the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the
Stockholders, the Warrantholders or any of their Affiliates, or any of their
respective Representatives or counsel, or that it had any sort of attorney-
client relationship with any of such Persons.

Section 5.11 _Consents and Estoppels_. The Company shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to seek (x) the consent of the counterparties to the
contracts set forth on _Annex F_ and (y) estoppels in a customary form from
the applicable landlord under the Leases set forth on _Annex F_ (it being
understood that in no event shall obtaining any such consent or estoppel be a
condition to Parents or Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Closing).
Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the
Company in respect of seeking such consents and estoppels.

Section 5.12 _Collected VAT Receivables_. From time to time (but not less
frequently than monthly) after the Closing and until the termination of the
Escrow Account, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will, and the Parent
will cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, deposit all Collected
VAT Receivables with the Escrow Agent, to be added to the Indemnity Holdback
Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 5.13 _Title Policies_. The Company shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to assist Parent (at Parents sole cost and expense) in obtaining (a)
an owners policy of title with respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property
and (b) a survey of the property located in Greenville, Pennsylvania (and an
updated survey for any other property for which the survey previously
provided to Parent does not contain all plottable encumbrances listed in the
new title policy) (i) identifying the location of such property, and (ii)
locating all plottable encumbrances listed in the related title policy.

Section 5.14 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
make Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain a vote of the Stockholders
entitled to vote, in a manner that satisfies the shareholder approval
requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder (a " _280G Stockholder Vote_ "), approving the right
of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
to receive any payment or benefit that would reasonably be expected to be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to avoid any payment received
by, or benefit provided to, such "disqualified individual" from being an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code (" _Excess Parachute_

 



53   _Payment_ "). The Company shall (a) provide drafts of any required waivers,
consents or agreements and any materials necessary to comply with the 280G
Stockholder Vote to Parent prior to submission to the Companys disqualified
individuals, with respect to such waivers, consents or agreements, or the
Companys Stockholders entitled to vote, with respect to documentation
necessary to comply with the 280G Stockholder Vote, and Parent shall have the
right to review and provide reasonable comments, which may be incorporated, to
the extent that they are timely provided by Parent and (b) make Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain all waivers, consents or agreements from each
disqualified individual of such disqualified individuals rights to some or
all payments or benefits contingent on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to avoid any payment or benefit that would reasonably be expected
to be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code from being an
Excess Parachute Payment. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with copies of all documents executed by the
Stockholders and disqualified individuals in connection with the 280G
Stockholder Vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of
doubt, the obligations of the Company contained in this Section 5.14 shall not
include obligations with respect to payments or benefits pursuant to
agreements or arrangements that create a right or entitlement to receive any
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code to any
"disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code that Parent or its
Affiliates has provided to, or entered into with (or directed a Person to
enter into with), such "disqualified individual", but of which the Company
does not have Knowledge.

ARTICLE VI __

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 6.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All representations
and warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV shall survive the
Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof (the " _Expiration Date_ ").
No Party shall be entitled to recover for any Loss pursuant to _Section
6.2(a)(i)_ unless written notice of a claim thereof is delivered to the
applicable Party prior to the Expiration Date.

Section 6.2 _General Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.2(c)_ and _Section 6.2(d)_, after the Closing, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to make a claim against the
Indemnity Holdback Amount for, and, subject to the provisions of this Article
VI may recover from the Indemnity Holdback Amount, any and all Losses that any
such Parent Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to as a
result of:

(i) any breach of any Express Representation (in each case ignoring, for
purposes of determining the inaccuracy or breach thereof and the amount of
Losses relating thereto, any qualification as to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect, expectation to result in a material liability or words of similar
import contained in any such representation or warranty (other than with
respect to (x) the term "Material Contract" or (y) the representations
contained in clause (a) of _Section 3.5_ (Financial Statements) and clause
(a) of  _Section 3.6_ (Absence of Certain Changes)), and

(ii) any breach of any covenant by the Stockholders Representative under
this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing.

 



54 (b) Parent shall indemnify the Company Indemnified Parties and save and hold
each of them harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such
Company Indemnified Party for any and all Losses that any Company Indemnified
Party may suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of (i) any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_ and
(ii) any breach of any covenant by Parent or Merger Sub.

(c) Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover for any Loss
pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations) (i) until the aggregate amount of all Losses that Parent
Indemnified Parties would, but for this _clause (i)_ , be entitled to
indemnification in respect thereof exceeds $1,242,500 in the aggregate (the "
_Deductible_ "), in which case, subject to _clause (ii)_ , Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover for all such Losses in excess of the
Deductible, or (ii) to the extent the aggregate amount of all Losses
previously indemnified pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)(i)_ (other than with
respect to Fundamental Representations) exceeds $1,242,500 (the " _General
Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (A) the
Deductible and the General Cap shall not apply with respect to any Loss
arising from (and such Loss shall not be counted toward the General Cap)
actual (but not constructive) common law fraud in respect of a
misrepresentation by the Company of an Express Representation; (B) no
Stockholder or Warrantholder shall be liable for any Losses in excess of the
portion of the Merger Consideration paid to such Stockholder or Warrantholder,
as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 6.2(c)_; (C) Losses in respect of which a Parent
Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification shall be
offset by (x) any amounts or benefits received (whether in the form of cash,
credit or some other beneficial arrangement, excluding tax benefits) from any
third party in respect of such Loss, and (y) the aggregate amount of any
insurance proceeds received (whether in the form of cash or credit) in respect
of such Loss; and (D) the indemnity obligations hereunder (1) shall not apply
to any environmental matter or condition that is discovered by any sampling,
investigation or reporting by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified Party
that is not either (x) required by Environmental Law, (y) necessary to respond
to, or defend against a Third-Party Claim with respect to any actual or
alleged liability arising from, based on or in connection with any Release of
a Hazardous Material under or from any property currently or formerly owned,
leased or operated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date regardless of when such Release is discovered,
migration of any such Release of Hazardous Material, or exposure to Hazardous
Material from such a Release, or (z) necessary for Parent Indemnified Party
to conduct bona fide construction or maintenance projects consistent with
commercial or industrial use of the Property or the expansion thereof and (2)
shall not apply to any Losses with respect to Remediation by
Parent Indemnified Party, except to the extent such Remediation is conducted
in a cost effective manner, and is required by Environmental Law to attain
compliance with minimum applicable remedial standards for the continued
commercial or industrial use of the relevant property or facility, employing
where available cost-effective, risk-based remedial standards. Parent
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Loss consisting of or
relating to Taxes with respect to any taxable period, or the portion of any
Straddle Period, beginning after the Closing Date as a result of any breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12_, other than
the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.12(g)_.

 



55 (d) In the event any Losses incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party are covered
by insurance or any indemnity, contribution or other similar right against a
third party, such Parent Indemnified Party shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to seek recovery under such insurance or indemnity,
contribution or similar right. For purposes of clarity, Parent shall be
responsible for the retention amount under the RWI Policy and, to the extent a
matter is covered under the RWI Policy but for the retention amount
thereunder, no claims shall be made under _Section 6.2(a)(i)_ by Parent with
respect to such matter until the Deductible has been satisfied. Parent
covenants to maintain in full force and effect the RWI Policy through the
policy period thereof and all product liability insurance of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as exists as of the Closing Date.

(e) Each Parent Indemnified Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event, state of facts,
circumstances or developments which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto. For purposes of clarity, and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
deemed not to have suffered any Loss arising from any liability to the extent
such liability was included in the determination of Final Working Capital,
Final Indebtedness or Final Transaction Expenses, as it is the intent of the
Parties that the procedures set forth in _Section 2.5_ shall provide the sole
and exclusive remedy for such claims

 

(f) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.2_
(an " _Indemnitee_ ") that arises from a claim by a third party (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of
the Third-Party Claim in writing, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if
known and quantifiable), and the basis thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to give a timely Claim Notice shall affect the
rights of an Indemnitee hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnitor with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall have
30 days after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify
the Indemnitee that it desires to defend the Indemnitee against such Third-
Party Claim.

(g) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee within the Notice
Period (the " _Defense Notice_ ") that it desires to defend the Indemnitee
against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the right to defend the
Indemnitee by appropriate Proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct
and control such defense at its expense commencing upon delivery of the
Defense Notice. The Indemnitee may participate in any such defense at its
expense. The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party
Claim on a basis that would result in (i) a finding or admission of a
violation of Law by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or (ii) any
monetary liability of the Indemnitee that is not concurrently paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnitor.

(h) If the Indemnitor elects not to defend the Indemnitee against a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right but not the obligation to
assume its own defense; it being understood that the Indemnitees right to
indemnification for a Third-Party Claim shall not

 



56  be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim in
such circumstance. If the Indemnitor elects not to defend the Indemnitee
against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee may not settle the Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(i) The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall cooperate in order to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by providing
access to each others relevant business records and other documents, and
employees.

(j) If an Indemnitee wishes to make a claim for indemnification hereunder for
a Loss that does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "),
the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Direct Claim,
the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent
then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount
of such Direct Claim).

 

(k) From and after the Closing, except in the event of actual (but not
constructive) common law fraud in respect of a misrepresentation by
the Company of an Express Representation, the sole and exclusive remedies for
any and all claims arising under or for breach of this Agreement shall be the
remedies provided in _Section 2.5_, _Section 8.10_, and the rights
of indemnification set forth in this _Section 6.2_, and no Person will have
any other entitlement, remedy or recourse for such claims against any
Contracting Party or any other Person (including with respect to any such
claims arising under CERCLA, or any other environmental, health or safety
matters), it being agreed that all such other remedies, entitlements and
recourse for such claims are expressly waived and released by the Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by Law. The provisions of this _Section 6.2(k)_
and the limited remedies provided in _Section 2.5_, _Section 6.2_, and
_Section 8.10_ were specifically bargained for by the Parties and were taken
into account by them in arriving at the Enterprise Value and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. No Party shall be entitled to a rescission of
this Agreement (or any related agreements) or any further indemnification
rights or claims of any nature whatsoever, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.2(k)_ is intended
to or shall relieve or release any Person from its obligations under any
other contract or other document to which such Person is expressly made a
party that is delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(l) Any amounts owing under _Section 6.2(a)_ shall be satisfied solely from
the then remaining balance of the Indemnity Holdback Amount. Any amounts
owing under _Section 6.2(b)_ shall be paid by Parent to the applicable
Company Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within three calendar days after the final determination thereof.
All indemnification payments under this _Section 6.2_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Final Purchase Price.

(m) On the first Business Day following the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to the Stockholders and the
Warrantholders an aggregate amount equal to (x) the then-remaining balance of
the Indemnity Holdback Amount, _minus_ (y) the aggregate amount of all Losses
specified in any then-unresolved good faith claims for indemnification made in
accordance with this Agreement prior to such date. Such aggregate amount
shall be

 



57  allocated among the Stockholders and the Warrantholders as if such amount
had been included in the Closing Merger Consideration and, as allocated, such
amounts shall be paid to the accounts of the Stockholders and the
Warrantholders as set forth in the Funds Flow.

(n) From and after the Closing, Olympus Growth Fund IV, L.P. shall control
the defense of, and indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties for any Losses
incurred by Parent Indemnified Parties resulting from, any claim made by any
Stockholder or Warrantholder in respect of the payment of the Control
Premium hereunder.

respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would render a condition precedent to the Companys
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in
_Section 2.8(a)_ or _Section 2.8(c)_ not capable of being satisfied, and
(ii) after the giving of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
to Parent by the Company, cannot be cured or has not been cured by the earlier
of the End Date and ten Business Days after the delivery of such notice;
_provided_ , however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to the Company or the Stockholders
Representative, if the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;

 



58 (d) by Parent, if the Company breaches in any material respect any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or breaches or
fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would render a
condition precedent to Parents obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 2.8(a)_ or _Section 2.8(b)_ not
capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform to the Company and the Stockholders
Representative by Parent, cannot be cured or has not been cured by the earlier
of the End Date and ten Business Days after the delivery of such notice;
_provided_ , however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(d)_ shall not be available to Parent if Parent is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement; or

 

(e) by the Company or the Stockholders Representative, if: (i) all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in  _Section 2.8(a)_ and _Section 2.8(b)_
were satisfied or waived as of the date the Closing should have been
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and could
have been satisfied or would have been waived assuming a Closing would occur),
(ii) the Company has notified Parent that the Company is ready, willing and
able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
Parent fails to complete the Closing within two Business Days after the
delivery of such notification.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall become void and
have no effect, and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders Representative, except
that _Article I_ , Section 5.2,  _Section 5.6_, _Section 5.7_, _Article
VIII_ and this _Section 7.2_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ , however, no such termination shall relieve any Party from any
liability arising out of or incurred as a result of its breach in any
material respect of the terms of this Agreement prior to such termination
(which shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Companys
direct or indirect equity holders taking into consideration all relevant
matters, including other opportunities and the time value of money), arising
out of such Partys breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VIII

such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in

the exercise of any

 



59  right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other right.

or to such other Person or address as any Party shall specify by notice in
writing in accordance with this  _Section 8.2_ to each of the other Parties.

Section 8.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits
and Annexes hereto and the Schedules, contains the entire understanding of the
Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, with respect thereto,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement. The

 



61  representations and warranties made by the Company in _Article III_ are the
exclusive representations and warranties made by the Company and the Company
hereby disclaims any other express or implied representations or warranties.

Section 8.4 _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement) and the transactions contemplated hereby, may be made,
subject to _Section 6.1_, only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (the "
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
any past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, Stockholder, Warrantholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any Contracting Party, or any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, Stockholder, Warrantholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial
advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty
Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
Law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of,
or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or
breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, each Contracting Party
hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and
obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, except to the extent
otherwise set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, each Contracting Party
disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.4 is intended to or shall relieve or
release any Person from its obligations under any other contract or other
document to which such Person is expressly made a party that is delivered
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 8.5 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and, with respect to the
provisions of Section 2.1, _Section 5.5_, _Section 5.9(a)_ and _Section
8.4_ shall inure to the benefit of the Persons benefiting from the provisions
thereof all of whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of each of the other Parties; provided, however, that any Party may
assign its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without prior
written consent; provided, however, that any such assignment shall not
relieve the assignor of any liability in connection with this Agreement. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 8.5_ will be void.

 

Section 8.6 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except by a written instrument executed by all Parties.

 



62 Section 8.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered via
fax or email in several counterparts.

Section 8.8 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES
THEREOF. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE
SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND
AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (I) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO
THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (II) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY IS
IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS OR (III) ANY ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN
_SECTION 8.2_ , OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL BE
VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO
SERVICE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER HEREIN PROVIDED

Section 8.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and
enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term, provision, covenant or restriction or any portion thereof had never
been contained herein. Upon such a determination, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 8.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached or
threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be
inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the Parties and
the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to
equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or
injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any Order sought by a Party to cause any other Party to
perform its agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement, in addition
to any other 

 



63  remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity as a remedy for any
such breach or threatened breach). Each Party further agrees that no other
Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.10_ and each Party irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument. Each Party further agrees that the
only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for
equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

Section 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND
AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 8.12 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document. Exhibits
and Schedules to this Agreement are attached hereto and by this reference
incorporated herein for all purposes. Any reference in this Agreement to an
"Article," "Exhibit," "Section," "Schedule," or "subsection" refers to the
corresponding Article, Exhibit, Section, Schedule or subsection of or to this
Agreement, unless expressly provided otherwise. The table of contents and the
headings of Articles, Exhibits, Sections, or subsections of this Agreement are
for convenience only, do not constitute any part of this Agreement and shall
be disregarded in construing the language herein. All words used in
this Agreement are to be construed to be of such gender or number as the
circumstances and context require. The words "this Agreement," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words of similar import, refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless
expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this Section" and "this
subsection," and words of similar import, refer only to the Article, Section
or subsection hereof in which such words occur. The word "or" is exclusive,
and the word "including" (in its various forms) means including without
limitation. Where this Agreement states that a party "shall," "will" or
"must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means the
party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any
reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor
legislation as in effect at the relevant time. Any reference to an agreement
or other document as of a given date means the agreement or other document as
amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such date. All
references to "$" and dollars shall be deemed to refer to United States
currency unless otherwise specifically provided. For the avoidance of doubt,
actual common law fraud does not include negligent misrepresentation or
omission or knowledge of the fact that the Person making such representation
or warranty does not have sufficient information to make the statement
contained in the representation and warranty set forth herein, but which is
nevertheless made as a matter of contractual risk allocation between the
Parties.

Section 8.13 _Schedules_. Matters reflected in the Schedules are
not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected
in the Schedules. To the extent any

 



64  such additional matters are included, they are included for informational
purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.
Headings and subheadings have been inserted in the Schedules for convenience
of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the
express description thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Disclosure of any
fact or item in this Agreement or any Schedule referenced by a particular
Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other Section in this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure would apply to
such other Sections. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion
of any specific item in any Schedule is intended to imply that such amounts,
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material or are within or outside the ordinary course of business, and no
Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of such amounts or the fact of
the inclusion of any such item in any Schedule in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter is or is not
required to be disclosed (including, whether such amounts or items are or are
not material), or may constitute an event or condition which could be
considered to have a Material Adverse Effect. No matter or item disclosed on a
Schedule admitting or indicating a possible breach or violation of any
contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that an
actual breach or violation exists, has actually occurred or will occur. The
Parties do not assume any responsibility to any Person that is not a Party to
this Agreement for the accuracy of any information set forth in the Schedules.
Subject to applicable Law, the information on the Schedules is disclosed in
confidence for the purposes contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to
the confidentiality provisions of any other agreements, including the
Confidentiality Agreement, entered into by the Parties or their Affiliates.
Moreover, in disclosing the information in the Schedules, each Party expressly
does not waive any attorney-client privilege associated with such information
or any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any
of the matters disclosed or discussed therein.

 

Section 8.14 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.
If the date specified for giving any notice or taking any action is not a
Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given
or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the
date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of
such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall
be the next date which is a Business Day.

 

Section 8.15 _Stockholders  Representative_.

 

(a) Pursuant to the Stockholders Approval dated on or about the date hereof,
the Letters of Transmittal and the Warrant Termination Agreements, as
applicable, the Stockholders and the Warrantholders have constituted,
appointed and empowered effective from and after the date of such consent,
Olympus Growth Fund IV, L.P. as the Stockholders Representative, for the
benefit of the Stockholders and the Warrantholders and the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Stockholder and Warrantholder,
in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which shall include the power and authority: (i) to
negotiate, execute and deliver such waivers, consents and amendments under
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
as the Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem
necessary or

 



65  desirable; (ii) as the Stockholders Representative, to enforce and protect
the rights and interests of the Stockholders and the Warrantholders and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of such Persons arising out of
or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein, as and to the extent applicable to them, and to take any
and all actions which the Stockholders Representative believes are necessary
or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the Stockholders and
the Warrantholders, including consenting to, compromising or settling any such
claims, conducting negotiations with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Representatives regarding such claims, and, in connection
therewith, to (A) assert any claim or institute any Action or investigation;
(B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Action or investigation
initiated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person, or by any
Governmental Entity against the Stockholders Representative and/or any of the
Stockholders or Warrantholders, and receive process on behalf of any or all
Stockholders and Warrantholders in any such Action or investigation and
compromise or settle on such terms as the Stockholders Representative shall
determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with
respect to, any such Action or investigation; (C) file any proofs of debt,
claims and petitions as the Stockholders Representative may deem advisable or
necessary; (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted under this Agreement;
and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award
rendered in any such Action or investigation, it being understood that the
Stockholders Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such
actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such
actions; (iii) to waive or refrain from enforcing any right of the
Stockholders or the Warrantholders arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that such waiver is in writing
signed by the Stockholders Representative; (iv) to make, execute, acknowledge
and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts,
endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers,
letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to
take any and all action that the Stockholders Representative, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (v) to engage outside counsel, accountants and other advisors and
incur such other expenses on behalf of the Stockholders and the Warrantholders
in connection with any matter arising under this Agreement; and (vi) to
collect, hold and direct the disbursement of (if applicable under this
Agreement) the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, the Expense Holdback
Amount, and the Indemnity Holdback Amount in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to
receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Stockholders and the
Warrantholders for certain expenses, charges and liabilities as provided
below. In connection with this Agreement, and in exercising or failing to
exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Stockholders
Representative hereunder, (i) the Stockholders Representative shall incur no
responsibility whatsoever to any Stockholders or Warrantholders by reason of
any act or omission performed or omitted hereunder, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct, and (ii) the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent
experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any act or omission of the
Stockholders Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject
the Stockholders Representative to liability to any Stockholders
or Warrantholders. Each Stockholder and Warrantholder shall indemnify,
severally and not jointly,

 



66  based on such Stockholders and Warrantholders pro rata share of Merger
Consideration received by such Stockholder and Warrantholder, as applicable,
the Stockholders Representative against all losses, damages, liabilities,
claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys,
accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against
them, of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or relating to any acts or
omissions (including any breach) of the Stockholders Representative
hereunder. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any
Action which finally adjudicates the liability of the Stockholders
Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. The Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to recover, at its sole discretion, from
the Expense Holdback Amount, prior to any distribution to the Stockholders or
the Warrantholders any amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the expense
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of this _Section 8.15(b)_.

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Stockholders
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and/or
any termination of this Agreement.

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally
binding upon the Stockholders and the Warrantholders.

 

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Stockholder or Warrantholder and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger, and any action taken by the Stockholders
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Agreement shall be
effective and binding on each Stockholder and Warrantholder notwithstanding
any contrary action of or direction from such Stockholder or Warrantholder,
except for actions or omissions of the Stockholders Representative
constituting willful misconduct.

(f) Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the Stockholders Representative is a Party to this Agreement in such
capacity solely to perform certain administrative functions in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, each of
the Company, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
Stockholders Representative shall have no liability to, and shall not be
liable for any losses of, any of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent in
connection with any obligations of the Stockholders Representative under
this Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent such losses shall be proven to be
the direct result of willful misconduct by the Stockholders Representative in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder.

Section 8.16 _Legal Representation_. Parent and the Company hereby agree,
on their own behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and their
current and future directors, managers, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates and each of their successors and assigns
(all such Persons, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Kirkland and Ellis LLP ("
_K andE_") (or any successor thereto) may represent the Stockholders
Representative or

 



67  any of the other Stockholders, or any of their respective, direct or
indirect, directors, managers, members, partners, officers, employees,
equityholders or Affiliates thereof, in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby (any such representation, the " _Post-
Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding its representation (or any
continued representation) of the Company or any subsidiary thereof, and each
of Parent and the Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby
consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of
interest or any objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Parent and
the Company each acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or
not KandE provides legal services to the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary thereof after the Closing Date. Each of Parent and the Company, for
itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that all communications among KandE, the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the
Stockholders Representative and/or any Stockholder and/or any director,
officer, manager, member, employee or representative of any of the foregoing
made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection herewith, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, are privileged communications and the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs solely to the Stockholders
Representative, and shall be exclusively controlled thereby and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and from and after
the Closing none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation any subsidiary thereof
or any other Person purporting to act on behalf thereof or any of the Waiving
Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. Except as set forth in
the next sentence, from and after the Closing, each of Parent and the Company,
on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication among KandE, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Stockholders Representative or any
Stockholders and/or any director, officer, manager, member, employee or
representative of any of the foregoing occurring prior to the Closing
in connection with any Post-Closing Representation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving
Company, the Company or any Company Subsidiary and a third party other than a
