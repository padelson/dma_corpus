Subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"); and DATAWATCH CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in _Exhibit A_.

_Recitals_

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Purchaser has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be extended
and amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer")
to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("Shares")
for thirteen dollars and ten cents ($13.10) per share of Company Common Stock
(such amount, or any different amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer to
the extent permitted under this Agreement, being the "Offer Price"), net to
the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable Tax
withholdings;

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") with
the Company as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"), whereby (except as otherwise provided herein), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (i) each issued and
outstanding Share (other than Shares irrevocably accepted for purchase in the
Offer, Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser as of both the commencement of the
Offer and the Effective Time, Shares owned by the Company as of the Effective
Time, and Dissenting Shares), will be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any
applicable Tax withholdings and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated herein, including the Offer and the
Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be effected under Section
251(h) and other relevant provisions of the DGCL, (iii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including the Offer and
the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, and (iv) resolved to recommend that
the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated herein;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Purchaser has determined that, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein are advisable
and in the best interests of Purchaser and its stockholders, and has approved
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
herein;

   

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have entered into agreements
with the directors, executive officers and certain stockholders of the Company
pursuant to which, among other things, such persons have, subject to the
terms thereof, irrevocably agreed to tender in the Offer the Shares
beneficially owned by each of them (each, a "Support Agreement" and
collectively, the "Support Agreements"); and

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be governed by and effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation
(within the meaning of Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and that the Company has complied with its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) business days after
the date of this Agreement (or such later date as the parties may agree),
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction, or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) by
Purchaser, of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the "Offer
Conditions") as of the Expiration Date in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.1(d)_, Purchaser shall promptly on or after the Expiration Date accept for
payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the "Offer Acceptance Time") and
pay (by delivery of funds to the Depository Agent) for all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Parent shall on or prior
to the Expiration Date provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a
timely basis, the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Company shall
register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the transfer of
the Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser effective as promptly as
practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



-2- 

    

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer
to Purchase") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, and
with consummation thereof subject to the Minimum Condition and the other Offer
Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer
Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition other than the Minimum Condition and
(iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion
of the Company), Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price other than
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)_, (B) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares
sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or supplement any of the
terms of the Offer or the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects
holders of Shares, (F) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, or (G)
extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as
required or permitted by this Agreement. The Offer may not be terminated prior
to the Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with  _Article_ __ _ VIII_.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. (Boston
time) on the date that is twenty (20) business days (calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the
Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date") or, in the event the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the
date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Date, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred
to as the "Expiration Date").

(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement
but subject to the parties respective rights to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_, (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser
may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to 10 business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to
be satisfied, (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for:
(A) any period required by any Law, any interpretation or position of the SEC
or the staff thereof or any rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock
Market ("NASDAQ") applicable to the Offer, and (B) periods of up to 10
business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act or any
applicable foreign Antitrust Law shall have expired or been terminated, (iii)
if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied
and has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend
the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to 10
business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied,
and (iv) if the Company has delivered a Change of Status Notice to Parent, and
the Company so requests, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more
occasions so that the Expiration Date does not occur earlier than two (2)
business days immediately after the expiration of the Notice Period or
Intervening Event Notice Period, as applicable; provided, however, that in no
event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier
to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in

 



-3- 

    

 compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and (y) the End Date (such earlier
date, the "Extension Deadline"), (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond
the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company, or
(3) be permitted, without the prior written consent of the Company, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, or required by the Company, to extend
the Offer by periods exceeding an aggregate of 20 business days in the event
that (x) the Company has not delivered to Parent a Change of Status Notice and
(y) each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) shall have been
satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled Expiration Date and the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied as of such scheduled Expiration Date.
Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date
without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

 

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement. 

(g) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or
otherwise restrict the right of the Company, Purchaser or Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) as promptly as practicable irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not acquire any Shares pursuant
to the Offer and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof.

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that will contain
or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related
letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related
documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall
cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto
(which together constitute the "Offer Documents") filed by either Parent or
Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Laws. Each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Parent further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Law. The Company

 



-4- 

    

 shall promptly furnish in writing or otherwise make available to Parent,
Purchaser or Parents legal counsel in writing any information concerning the
Acquired Entities and, to the extent reasonably available to the Company,
their stockholders or other equity owners that is required in connection with
any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(h)_. The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and
Purchaser shall give due consideration to any such comments. Parent and
Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
(including a summary of any oral comments) that Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments (and shall give the Company
prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC or its
staff), and the Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any response to such comments prior to the submission
thereof. Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to any such
comments, and, to the extent permissible and, in Parents reasonable judgment,
feasible under the circumstances, shall allow the Company and/or its counsel
to participate in any meetings with the SEC or its staff with respect
thereto. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to by the Company and Purchaser, any Shares subject to notices of
guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer
unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are
delivered to Purchaser or to an agent of Purchaser.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents
that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein are in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein in accordance with
the requirements of the DGCL and (iii) resolved to recommend that stockholders
of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer (the actions taken by the Company Board set forth in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii), the "Company Board Recommendation"). Subject to _Section_ __ _
5.4_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation (including the reasons therefor) in the Offer
Documents.

(b) As promptly as practicable subsequent to the commencement of the Offer,
following the filing of the Schedule TO (and in any event within two business
days after the filing of the Schedule TO), the Company shall file with the SEC
and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to _Section_ __ _
5.4_, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation. Parent and Purchaser
shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning
Parent and Purchaser required by applicable Law for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9

 



-5- 

    

 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Laws. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain the notice of appraisal
rights required to be delivered by the Company under Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL in connection with a merger effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL at the time the Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The
Company shall set the record date for the Companys stockholders to receive
such notice of appraisal rights as the same date as the Stockholder List Date
and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 including such notice of appraisal
rights to the Companys stockholders to the extent required by Section 262(d)
of the DGCL. The Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to promptly be filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Law. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to
any such comments. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with
any comments (including a summary of any oral comments) the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments (and shall give Parent prompt
telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC or its staff), and
the Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any response to such comments prior to the submission thereof. The
Company shall give due consideration to any such comments, and, to the extent
permissible and, in the Companys reasonable judgment, feasible under the
circumstances, shall allow Parent and/or its counsel to participate in any
meetings with the SEC or its staff with respect thereto.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall (or shall cause its
transfer agent to) promptly (and in sufficient time to enable Purchaser to
commence the Offer within the time period specified in Section 1.1(a)) furnish
Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available
listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock
depositories, in each case accurate and as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request
in connection with the Offer (the date of the list used to determine the
Persons to whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated,
the "Stockholder List Date"). Subject to the requirements of applicable Law
and provided that (i) the Company shall not have made an Adverse Change
Recommendation and (ii) this Agreement shall not otherwise have been
terminated, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
solicitations and recommendations to the record holders and beneficial owners
of Shares for purposes of causing the Minimum Condition to be satisfied.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, Parent and
Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, with such being subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall,

exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of

represented by book entry (a "Book Entry Share") (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and less any applicable Tax withholdings, and
each Certificate formerly representing Shares or Book Entry Shares owned by

-8- 

    

(ii) Each Dissenting Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to any rights the holder of such Dissenting Share may have

delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Section_ __ _

proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and at
or prior to the Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger
Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is

 Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause Purchaser to deposit, with the Depository Agent cash
sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_ and with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make
payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_
(together, the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment
or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by
_Article_ __ _ I_ or this _Article_ __ _ II_ or affect the amount of the
aggregate Offer Price or the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Shares and following any losses, or if for any other reasons the Payment Fund
shall not be sufficient to make prompt payment of the Offer Price or Merger
Consideration (including as a result of Dissenting Shares losing their status
as such), Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent
in the amount of any such losses or any other amount necessary so that the
Payment Fund is sufficient to make prompt payment of the aggregate Offer Price
and Merger Consideration, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and
(iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than three (3) months or guaranteed by,

and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall
become part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable in connection with the Offer or under _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall be
promptly returned to either Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any purpose not contemplated by this _Section_ __
_ 2.7_. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Depository Agent and the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of
Shares and the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event within five (5)
business days after the Effective Time), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or non-certificated Shares represented by Book Entry Shares
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly
evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book Entry Shares are registered.

(c) At any time following the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Law) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for
any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares.

 

(e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book Entry
Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
for transfer in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.
No Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book Entry Share until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book Entry Share in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the Offer
Price or Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares such amounts as
it is required by any Law to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes and
shall remit such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Body in accordance
with applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to
the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



-11- 

    

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which shall include an
agreement to indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims,
losses, judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities whatsoever
which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection with the failure of any
statement, representation or warranty set forth in such affidavit, any
payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such Certificate and such
Persons inability to locate such Certificate, and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_) equal to the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate that have been
surrendered multiplied by the per Share Merger Consideration.

 

2.8 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands and perfects
appraisal rights for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holders appraisal rights under
the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration and shall entitle such holder only to such
rights as are provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such holder fails to
perfect or waives, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal of its Shares. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to
perfect or waives, withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal with
respect to any Dissenting Shares held by such holder, each such Dissenting
Share shall be treated as if it had never been a Dissenting Share and been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon (less any amounts entitled to be
deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_). The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments or documents
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent shall have the right to direct and participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of such demands or agree
or commit to do any of the foregoing.

2.9 Company Equity Awards.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be canceled and instead represent solely the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company Equity
Plan, the applicable Option Consideration with respect to such Company Option
(which may be, and shall not be less than, zero). The cash payment, if any,
contemplated by this _Sections 2.9(a)_ in cancellation and settlement of each
outstanding Company Option (to the extent unexercised as of the Effective
Time) shall be payable by Parent in a lump sum (net of any withholding Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld by applicable Law) through the Companys
payroll system or by check no later than the first payroll period after the
Effective Time.

 



-12- 

    

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting
that is contingent upon the completion of the Merger) shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and
instead represent solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Company Equity Plan, the Merger Consideration with
respect to the Shares that would otherwise have been issuable upon settlement
of the vested portion of such Company RSU (less applicable Tax withholdings).
The payment, if any, contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_ with respect
to each outstanding Company RSU to the extent vested as of the Effective Time
(after giving effect to any vesting that is contingent upon the completion of
the Merger) shall be payable (without any crediting of interest for the period
from the Effective Time through the date of payment) by Parent in a lump sum
through the Companys payroll system or by check on the first regular payroll
date following the Effective Time, subject to applicable Tax withholding
requirements.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting
that is contingent upon the completion of the Merger) shall be converted into
and become a substitute right or award to receive (without interest), subject
to the terms and conditions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_, an amount in
cash (less applicable Tax withholdings), equal to the product of (i) the Offer
Price and (ii) the number of Shares underlying the unvested portion of such
Company RSU. The payment, if any, contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
2.9(c)_ with respect to such substitute right or award with respect to each
outstanding Company RSU to the extent unvested as of the Effective
Time (after giving effect to any vesting that is contingent upon the
completion of the Merger) shall be payable (without any crediting of interest
for the period from the Effective Time through the date of payment) by Parent
in a lump sum through the Companys payroll system or by check on or after
the date that such Company RSU would have otherwise vested in accordance with
its terms (and in any event not later than the earlier of (1) December 31st of
the year during which such vesting date occurs or (2) the first regular
payroll date following the date of termination for any such employee) but only
if such conditions to vesting are satisfied prior to such vesting date;
provided that if the employment or service of such grantee of such Company RSU
is terminated by the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates prior to such
vesting date under conditions that would have accelerated the vesting of such
Company RSU had it remained outstanding, then such vesting shall be
accelerated as of the date of such termination of employment or service.

 

2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Since October 1, 2015,
the Company has not received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim regarding deficiencies in the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or its internal accounting
controls.

commitment to become a party to any securitization transaction, joint
venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any
Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Acquired Entities, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, any Acquired Entity in any
Acquired Entitys published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person or
"group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons making

after the commencement of such offer, (D) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to
the vote of securityholders or declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal or

except as expressly permitted by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_.

 



-46- 

    

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Change Recommendation (other than as reflected in clause (E) of the
definition thereof, unless such Adverse Change Recommendation referred to in
such clause (E) is made with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal) or, subject to the prior or
concurrent payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ to enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, if
and only if:

(1) such Superior Proposal did not arise or result from a breach of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_;

(2) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make such Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law;

(3) Parent shall have received from the Company prior written notice of the
Companys intention to make such an Adverse Change Recommendation or to
terminate this Agreement to enter into any such Company Acquisition Agreement
at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement (a "Change of Status Notice"), which Change of Status
Notice shall be accompanied by unredacted copies of all draft agreements
embodying such Superior Proposal (other than financing-related documents that
may be provided in redacted form) and, unless reflected in such draft
agreements, a description of the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal, it being understood that such Change of Status Notice shall not, in
and of itself, constitute an Adverse Change Recommendation; and

(4) the Company shall have complied with clauses (A) through (C) (as
applicable) as follows and the conditions described in clause (C) shall have
been satisfied:

(A) prior to giving effect to clauses (B) and (C), the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and that failure to terminate this Agreement or to make
an Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties;

(B) the Company shall have complied with this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal (other than non-compliance that is
immaterial in significance and inadvertent); and

 



-47- 

    

(C) Parent shall not have made, within three (3) business days of its receipt
of the Change of Status Notice (the "Notice Period"), a written offer or
proposal that remains outstanding and unmodified as of the end of the Notice
Period and that, upon binding acceptance by the Company, is binding on Parent
to revise the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a "Revised Transaction
Proposal") in a manner that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is
reasonably likely to be consummated if accepted on the terms thereof and is
at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
perspective as such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, during the
Notice Period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Representatives to)
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate
and makes itself reasonably available to negotiate) regarding any Revised
Transaction Proposal; provided, further, that any amendment to the financial
terms of such Superior Proposal or any other material amendment to the terms
of such Superior Proposal during the Notice Period shall require the Company
to deliver a new Change of Status Notice with respect to such amended
Superior Proposal and the Notice Period shall expire three (3) business days
subsequent to delivery of such new Change of Status Notice to the extent the
Notice Period would otherwise have expired prior to three (3) business
days subsequent to delivery of such new Change of Status Notice, including
with respect to the Companys obligations to negotiate in good faith with
Parent and to cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with
Parent.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make an Adverse Change
Recommendation (as set forth in clause (A) thereof) with respect to an
Intervening Event, if and only if:

(1) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse Change
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board under applicable Law; 

(2) Parent shall have received from the Company a Change of Status Notice at
least three (3) business days prior to making any such Adverse Change
Recommendation (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), which Change of
Status Notice shall be accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the
Intervening Event, a description of the bases for the conclusion that the
events described in such Change of Status Notice constitute an Intervening
Event and unredacted copies of any material documentation relating thereto, it
being understood that such Change of Status Notice shall not, in and
of itself, constitute an Adverse Change Recommendation;

(3) during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to
negotiate with Parent), to the extent Parent desires to negotiate and makes
itself reasonably available to negotiate, with respect to any proposed
revisions to this Agreement or other proposals made by Parent, if any, that
would obviate the need to make such an Adverse Change Recommendation; and

 



-48- 

    

(4) after considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into
account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and the Companys financial advisors, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith that the failure to make such Adverse
Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable Law.

In the event of a material change to the facts and circumstances relating to
an Intervening Event in respect of which the Company shall have previously
provided to Parent a Change of Status Notice, the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.4(b)(iii)_ shall also apply to each subsequent material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event (in which case each
such material change shall require a new Change of Status Notice and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)(iii)_), provided that the Intervening Event Notice
Period shall expire three (3) business days subsequent to delivery of such new
Change of Status Notice to the extent the Intervening Event Notice Period
would otherwise have expired prior to three (3) business days subsequent to
delivery of such new Change of Status Notice.

 

(c) _Notices to Parent_. The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing of receipt by the Company
of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information, in each
case on or subsequent to the date hereof, in connection with, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or request and the
identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or request. Such
notice shall be accompanied by unredacted copies of any draft agreements
embodying any such Acquisition Proposal. In addition to any other
notifications required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the Company shall
endeavor in good faith to provide Parent with updates regarding any
material developments (and unredacted copies of any draft agreements relating
thereto, other than financing-related documents that may be provided in
redacted form) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal identified by the
Company in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within two business days) notify Parent of the
receipt by the Company of any material modification to any such Acquisition
Proposal, unless prohibited by any Antitrust Laws or comparable Laws.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _
5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking
and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board or any committee thereof, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under applicable Law or any disclosure
requirements under applicable Law, or (iii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a stop, look and listen communication or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that (1) in no event shall this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_
affect the Companys obligations specified in _Sections 5.4(a)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_ and (2) any such disclosure (other than issuance by
the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or
relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the

 



-49- 

    

 Company Board with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Change Recommendation unless the Company
Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the
prior recommendation of the Company Board, without disclosing any Adverse
Change Recommendation.

 

(e) _Breach_. The Company agrees that any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_
by any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives shall
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ by the Company.

Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated

not have any obligation to proffer to, or agree or consent to (or to cause
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to proffer to, or agree or consent to) (i) sell, license, lease,
transfer, divest, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate any

Parent, the Company (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation), or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or
otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the
Company (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation),
(iv) otherwise take any action that would limit the freedom of action of
Parent, the Company (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with
respect to, or the ability of Parent, the Company (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), or any of their respective

of doubt, Parent shall not require the Company to, and the Company shall not
be required to, take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable
Law unless contingent upon the occurrence of the transactions contemplated
hereby. With respect to any Governmental Body in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall, without Parents prior written consent in Parents sole discretion,
discuss or commit to any action referred to in _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_
above.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require,
Parent or any of its Affiliates to take any other action under this _Section_

injunction or restraining order to enjoin the consummation of
the Transactions.

(f) No party hereto shall take any action that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay its ability or
the ability of any other party hereto to perform its covenants and agreements

6.2 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) For the six (6) month period immediately following the Effective Time,
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to employees of
the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who shall continue to be employed by the
Surviving Corporation ("Continuing Employees"), base salary or wage level and
annual target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation and,
for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any retiree healthcare or defined
benefit retirement benefits) that, in the aggregate, are substantially
similar to the annual base salary or wage level and annual target bonus
opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation and, for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding any retiree healthcare or defined benefit retirement
benefits) provided to those employees immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement.

(b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "PSV Policies"), to the extent accrued in the most
recent consolidated financial statements of the Company filed with the SEC and
since the date of such financial statements in the Ordinary Course of
Business, Parent shall assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick
or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time, subject to the terms and conditions of such
PSV Policies (as such policies are in effect on the date hereof or are
amended or modified with Parents consent). Parent shall be permitted to
terminate, amend or modify the PSV Policies at any time, in its sole
discretion.

 

(c) Following the Effective Time, Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to give each Continuing Employee credit for prior service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries under Parent Employee Plans (as defined below) in
which such Continuing Employees are eligible to participate, if any, for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (excluding defined benefit plans and
retiree plans), but not for purposes of benefit accrual (except for paid time
off, to the extent applicable) to the same extent as such Continuing Employee
was entitled immediately prior to the Effective Time to credit for such
service under any similar Employee Plan or if such service is recognized
under a Parent Employee Plan providing severance or retirement benefits for
similarly situated employees of Parent; provided, however, such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service, (y) such
service was not recognized under the corresponding Employee Plan or (z) such
service with respect to a newly established Parent Employee Plan for which
similarly-situated employees of Parent do not receive past service credit. In
addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause
to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions
to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of
the Parent and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket
limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs, in each case, to the extent Continuing Employees
participate in any such comparable plan of the Parent. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Parent Employee Plan" means any "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), and any "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), for the benefit of, or
relating to, any current employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-53- 

    

(d) This _ Section 6.2_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _
Section 6.2_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
third-party beneficiary rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this _ Section 6.2_ or inure to the benefit of or be
enforceable by any employee, director or independent consultant of the
Company, Parent and their Subsidiaries, of any entity or any Person
representing the interest of any employees, directors or independent
consultants or of any Person whose rights are derivative of any such employee
(including a family member or estate of the employee). Nothing contained
herein, express or implied shall (i) be construed to establish, amend or
modify any Employee Plan or other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _ Section 6.2_
shall not create any right in any Company employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement will be
treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Plan.

 

6.3 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) From the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"),
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL for officers and directors of Delaware
corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable
law, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides a written
personal undertaking to repay such advances if it is determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification. In making a determination with
respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or
entity making such determination shall presume that each Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification and the other benefits of this  _Section_ __ _
6.3_.

 



-54- 

    

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, or corresponding governing
documents, of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain,
and Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, or
corresponding governing documents, of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently
set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, which provisions shall not be amended,
modified or repealed for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or directors of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement

irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of
any legal or equitable action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to
enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action, suit or proceeding, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,

the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each party agrees that notice or the service of process in any action,

bond in connection with such remedy or any requirement to prove damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties
hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_, a party

event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.6(b)_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _Article_ __ _ VIII_ (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ or anything set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article_ __ _ VIII_ or pursue

obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that either Parent or Purchaser may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests

respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by

breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance

prior to the Effective Time shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of
Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole
discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out
of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent
and Purchaser in the first instance.

_ARTICLE IX_

 

1\. _Actions other than by or in the Right of the Corporation._ The
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact
that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgements,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgement, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo_ _contendere_ or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

 

2\. _Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the Corporation to procure a judgement in its favor by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made
in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have
been adjudged to be liable unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication
of liability but in view of all the

 



B-2

    

 circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. 

3\. _Success on the Merits_. To the extent that any person described in
Section 1 or 2 of this Article IX has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in said
Sections, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

4\. _Specific Authorization_. Any indemnification under Section 1 or Section 2
of this Article IX (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent
is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in said Sections. Such determination shall be made, with
respect to a person who is a director or officer of the Corporation at the
time of such determination: (1) by a majority vote of the directors who were
not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a
quorum; or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of
such directors, even though less than a quorum; or (3) if there are no such
directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

 

5\. _Advance Payment_. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled
to indemnification by the Corporation as authorized in this Article IX.

6\. _Claims_. If a claim for indemnification under this Article IX (following
the final disposition of such proceeding) is not paid in full within sixty
days after the Corporation has received a claim therefor, or if a claim for
any advancement of expenses under this Article IX is not paid in full within
thirty days after the Corporation has received a statement or statements
requesting such amounts to be advanced, the person claiming entitlement to
such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall thereupon (but not
before) be entitled to file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim.
If successful in whole or in part, such person shall be entitled to be paid
the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law.
In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that
such person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of
expenses under applicable law.

7.  _Non-Exclusivity_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article IX
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those provided
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors otherwise, both as
to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

 



B-3

    

8\. _Insurance_. The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of the
majority of the full board, the Corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out
of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX.

9\. _Continuation of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant
to, this Article IX shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

10\. _Severability_. If any word, clause or provision of this Article IX or
any award made hereunder shall for any reason be determined to be invalid, the
provisions hereof shall not otherwise be affected thereby but shall remain in
full force and effect.

 

11\. _Intent of Article_. The intent of this Article IX is to provide for
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted
by Section 145 of the DGCL. To the extent that such Section or any successor
section may be amended or supplemented from time to time, this Article IX
shall be amended automatically and construed so as to require indemnification
and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent from time to time permitted
by law.
