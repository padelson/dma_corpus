outstanding shares of common stock of the Final Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Second Effective Time.

 



 

(d) The " _Closing Merger Consideration_ " shall mean a number of Buyer

with the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

by, this Agreement a number of Buyer Ordinary Shares that exceeds nineteen and
nine tenths percent (19.9%) of the total number of Buyer Ordinary Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing or that would
otherwise require approval of the shareholders of Buyer under applicable Law
or stock exchange rules (the " _Share Cap_ ") unless, prior to any issuance of
Buyer Ordinary Shares in excess of the Share Cap, Buyer has obtained

Final Merger Consideration then due and payable to the Pre-Closing Holders
shall be paid in cash.

(ii) the number of Buyer Ordinary Shares constituting Holdback Shares
allocable to each Company Stockholder; (iii) the amounts and payees of any

that is paid, if any, pursuant to _Section 3.10,_ and the payees to whom such

to time following the Closing, the Payment Spreadsheet shall be amended by the
Stockholder Representative, in order to make any necessary updates to the
payment amounts to be received by, or the Pro Rata Shares of, the Pre-Closing
Holders in accordance with the provisions of the Company Charter, as amended
and in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing, after taking into
account any and all portions of the Final Merger Consideration previously paid
to each Pre-Closing Holder, including any Buyer Ordinary Shares (or cash in
lieu thereof) that may be released to the Company Stockholders from the
Holdback Shares and any cash amounts that may be released to the Pre-Closing
Holders from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund. The Buyer shall be

Option who has executed and returned to Buyer a Surrender Agreement in the
form attached hereto as _Annex F_ (" _Surrender Agreement_ ") will be entitled
to receive, in consideration of such cancelled Company Option and in full
settlement therefor, a payment in cash in an amount equal to the applicable
portion of the Final Merger Consideration as set forth on the Payment
Spreadsheet (which, for the avoidance of doubt, nets out the applicable
aggregate exercise price with respect to such Company Option) (the aggregate
consideration to be paid to holders of Company Options at Closing, the "
_Closing Option Consideration_ ," and the aggregate consideration to be paid
to holders of Company Options pursuant to this Agreement, including _Section

executed and returned to Buyer a Surrender Agreement) a payment in cash in an

set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet (which, for the avoidance of doubt, nets
out the applicable aggregate exercise price with respect to such Company
Warrant) (the aggregate consideration to be paid to the holder of the Company
Warrant, the " _Warrant Consideration_ "), less applicable Tax withholding.

relates to Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards or the Company
Warrant. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, the Final Surviving Corporation will be required to
deliver the Option Consideration to former holders of Company Options.

if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing is fixed, appropriate
and proportionate adjustments shall be made to the Final Merger Consideration
and the Payment Spreadsheet.

to the releases and indemnification obligations and the appointment of the
Stockholder Representative as contemplated by Article XI) to the Exchange
Agent or Buyer, shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent or Buyer
in exchange therefor such number of Buyer Ordinary Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the portion of the Final Merger Consideration
into which such holders Shares shall have been converted as a result of the
First Merger; _provided_ , that each Cash-Out Holder shall receive its
applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration in cash in accordance
with Section 3.1; _provided_ , _further_ , that a number of Buyer Ordinary
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration equal to the Holdback Shares otherwise payable to
each Company Stockholder, in the amounts set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet,
shall be retained by Buyer to satisfy any amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to
the Pre-Closing Holders indemnification obligations pursuant to _Article

extent that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company has delivered customary
payoff letters and releases with respect thereto, and (ii) the Transaction
Expenses that remain unpaid as of immediately prior to the Closing. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall seek (at Buyers sole cost and expense)

Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (it being understood that the Company need not incur any
unreimbursed expense or liability prior to the Effective Time in connection
therewith).

_Section 3.4(a)_) and (b) a written statement setting forth (i) its good
faith estimate of (A) Closing Date Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital_ "), (B) the Closing Cash Amount (the " _Estimated

calculations thereof in reasonable detail, by reference to the foregoing
Closing Balance Sheet and supporting documentation and (ii) the Companys
calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount.

 



 

3.4 _Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within seventy-five (75) calendar days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholder Representative (i) the Closing Balance Sheet and
(ii) calculations of (w) Net Working Capital (" _Closing Date Net Working

prior to the Effective Time consistent (except as provided in this _Section
3.4(a)_) with the Closing Balance Sheet, (x) the Closing Cash Amount, (y) the
Closing Indebtedness Amount, and (z) the Excess Transaction Expenses. The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied in a
manner consistent with the principles applied in connection with the
preparation of the most recent audited balance sheet included in the Financial
Statements. Following the Closing and until the final determination of the
Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall, upon reasonable advanced written notice in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
the Buyer, provide the Stockholder Representative and its representatives
access during normal business hours to the records, properties, personnel and
(subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if requested)
auditors of the Company solely relating to the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet and shall cause the personnel of the Company to cooperate with
the Stockholder Representative in connection with its review of the Closing
Balance Sheet.

 



 

(b) If the Stockholder Representative shall disagree with such calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Cash Amount, Closing Indebtedness
Amount or Excess Transaction Expenses, it shall notify Buyer of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing
Balance Sheet. In the event that the Stockholder Representative does not
provide a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30)-day period, the
Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash Amount, Closing Indebtedness Amount and Excess
Transaction Expenses delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any notice of disagreement
is timely provided, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of fifteen (15) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Cash
Amount, Closing Indebtedness Amount and Excess Transaction Expenses. If, at
the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then
any such remaining disagreements shall be resolved by KPMG LLP or such other
independent accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative (such firm, the " _Independent Auditor_ "). Each of Buyer and
the Stockholder Representative shall promptly provide their respective
assertions regarding Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Cash Amount,
Closing Indebtedness Amount or Excess Transaction Expenses, as applicable,
and, to the extent relevant thereto, the Closing Balance Sheet in writing to
the Independent Auditor and to each other. The Independent Auditor shall be
instructed to render its determination with respect to such disagreements as
soon as reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be
later than sixty (60) days following the day on which the disagreement is
referred to the Independent Auditor). The Independent Auditor shall base its
determination solely on (i) the written submissions of the parties and shall
not conduct an independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Cash Amount, Closing Indebtedness
Amount or Excess Transaction Expenses requires adjustment (only with respect
to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Independent Auditor) in

 



      
 

 



 

order to be determined in accordance with _Section 3.4(a)_ (including the
definitions of the defined terms used in _Section 3.4(a)_). In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Auditor may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
determination of the Independent Auditor shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The date on which Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash Amount, Closing Indebtedness Amount and Excess Transaction
Expenses is finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.4(b)_ is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_." All fees and expenses
of the Independent Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Independent Auditor hereunder shall be borne pro rata as between Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative as a Stockholder
Representative Expense, on the other hand, in proportion to the allocation of
the dollar value of the amounts in dispute as between Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative (set forth in the written submissions to the
Independent Auditor) made by the Independent Auditor such that the party
prevailing on the greater dollar value of such disputes pays the lesser
proportion of the fees and expenses. For example, if the Stockholder
Representative challenges items underlying the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital in the net amount of $1,000,000, and the Independent Auditor
determines that Buyer has a valid claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Buyer
shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor and the
Stockholder Representative shall bear the remaining 40% of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Auditor as a Stockholder Representative Expense.

 



 

(c) The " _Adjustment Amount_ " means the amount, if any, by which (a) the sum
of the Closing Indebtedness Amount, plus the Excess Transaction Expenses
exceeds (b) the Closing Date Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Adjustment Amount may not be a negative number. The " _True-up Amount_ "
means the positive amount, if any, by which the Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Estimated Adjustment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt the True-up Amount may
not be a negative number.

 



 

(d) If the True-up Amount is a positive number, then Buyer shall reduce the
number of Holdback Shares by a number of Buyer Ordinary Shares (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) equal to (A) the True-up Amount divided by (B) the
Buyer Share Price. In no event shall the Stockholder Representative or any
Pre-Closing Holder have any liability under this _Section 3.4_ in excess of
such Pre-Closing Holders allocable share of the Holdback Shares.

 



 

(e) All amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be treated by the
parties hereto for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Closing Merger
Consideration to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Law, and shall be
reported as such by the parties hereto on their Tax Returns.

 



 

3.5 _Stockholder Representative Expenses_. On or immediately prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to $200,000 (the "
_Stockholder Representative Expense Fund_ "), in accordance with the Payment
Spreadsheet, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Stockholder Representative for the purpose of

 



      
 

 



 

paying the fees and expenses incurred, or that may in the future be incurred,
by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company and the Pre-Closing
Holders in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative (the "
_Stockholder Representative Expenses_ "). No amount shall be included on the
Closing Balance Sheet with respect to liabilities for the Stockholder
Representative Expenses. The Stockholder Representative Expense Fund shall be
used (a) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Stockholder
Representative for any Stockholder Representative Expenses incurred pursuant
to this Agreement, or (b) as otherwise determined by the Stockholder
Representative. The Stockholder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund, and has no Tax reporting or income distribution obligations. Subject to
approval of the Majority Holders, the Stockholder Representative may
contribute funds to the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund from any
consideration otherwise distributable to the Pre-Closing Holders, and the
Stockholder Representative shall distribute any funds remaining in the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund to the Pre-Closing Holders who have
complied with _Sections 3.2(b)_ , _3.2(c)_ and _3.2(d)_ , as applicable, in
accordance with the Payment Spreadsheet and their respective Pro Rata Shares (
_provided_ , that amounts payable in respect of Company Options shall be
distributed to the Final Surviving Corporation for payment through its payroll
system within three (3) Business Days of the date the Stockholder
Representative delivers such funds to the Final Surviving Corporation and
amounts payable in respect of the Company Warrant shall be distributed to the
Final Surviving Corporation for payment following withholding of Taxes) at
such time as the Stockholder Representative determines there are no further
Stockholder Representative Expenses. For all Tax purposes, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Pre-Closing Holders at the time of Closing.

 



 

3.6 _Exchange Agent_. With respect to each payment to be paid by Buyer to the
Pre-Closing Holders hereunder, promptly following the date that is one (1)
year following the date that such payment is made by Buyer to the Exchange
Agent, Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Buyer all cash,
Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agents duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each Pre-Closing Holder of a Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) may surrender such Certificate to
Buyer and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws)
receive in consideration therefor, and Buyer shall promptly pay, the portion
of the Final Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined
in accordance with this _Article III_ without any interest thereon.

 



 

3.7 _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and a customary
indemnification of the Company and the Buyer in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Final Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article III_.

 



      
 

 



 

3.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Article III_, the Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to
receive any portion of the Final Merger Consideration and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such
shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from
the Final Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed
to establish such holders entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL, or (ii) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall
have effectively withdrawn such holders demand for appraisal of such shares
or lost such holders right to appraisal and payment for such holders shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to
appraisal of such shares and each such share shall not constitute a Dissenting
Share and shall be treated as if it had been a Share, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted, as of the Effective
Time, into a right to receive from the Final Surviving Corporation the portion
of the Final Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined
in accordance with this _Article III_, without any interest thereon (and such
holder shall be treated as a Pre-Closing Holder). The Company will give Buyer
reasonable notice of all written notices received by the Company pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. Without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment. From and after the Effective Time, no
stockholder who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to vote his or her Shares for any
purpose or receive payment of dividends or other distributions with respect to
his or her Shares (except dividends and distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any payments required to be made to holders
of Dissenting Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ shall be made by the
Final Surviving Corporation out of its own funds. No funds will be supplied
for that purpose, directly or indirectly, by Buyer (or any of its Affiliates
except for the Final Surviving Corporation), nor will Buyer (or any of its
Affiliates except for the Final Surviving Corporation) directly or indirectly
reimburse the Final Surviving Corporation for any payments to holders of
Dissenting Shares.

 



 

3.9 _Withholding_. Buyer, the Company, the Final Surviving Corporation, the
Stockholder Representative and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable or deliverable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to any Person
such amounts that Buyer, the Company, the Final Surviving Corporation, the
Stockholder Representative and the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or
any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Law. Any party otherwise
proposing to withhold from a payment to a Company Stockholder to be made
pursuant to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide at least ten (10) days advance written notice to such Company
Stockholder on behalf of which such withholding is to be made, and shall
cooperate with any reasonable request by such party to reduce or eliminate the
obligation to withhold; provided, however, that no such notice shall be
required if the Company has not provided the certificate described in _Section
9.2(h)_ or such Company Stockholder has not provided an IRS Form W-9 or
applicable IRS Form W-8 requested by the withholding party. To the extent that
amounts are withheld, and duly and timely deposited with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, by Buyer, the Company, the Final Surviving
Corporation, the Stockholder Representative or the Exchange

 



      
 

 



 

Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

3.10 _Milestone Payments_.

 



 

(a) Additional payments (each payment set forth in any of clauses (i) through
(iv) below, a " _Milestone Payment_ ") shall be made by Buyer, in further
consideration of the Merger being consummated, in accordance with _Section
3.10(d)_ upon the first achievement of the applicable milestone set forth
below during the Milestone Period:

 



 

(i) $25,000,000, payable in Buyer Ordinary Shares (except as otherwise set
forth in _Section 3.10(d)_ with respect to any holder of Company Options or
Company Warrants or any Cash-Out Holder and subject to the Share Cap), upon
the receipt of the first approval of a new drug application from the FDA for a
Company Milestone Product for any indication (the " _Approval Milestone_ ");

 



 

(ii) $12,500,000, payable in cash, upon first achievement of Net Sales that
exceed $[**] during any calendar year (the " _Net Sales 1 Milestone_ ");

 



 

(iii) $20,000,000, payable in cash, upon first achievement of Net Sales that
exceed $[**] during any calendar year (the " _Net Sales 2 Milestone_ "); and

 



 

(iv) $40,000,000, payable in cash, upon first achievement of Net Sales that
exceed $[**] during any calendar year (the " _Net Sales 3 Milestone_ ").

 



 

(v) Each Milestone Payment shall be paid no more than once and nothing herein
shall imply that Buyer is obligated to seek to achieve any Milestone more than
once. In no event shall Buyer pay or otherwise owe any amounts in excess of
$97,500,000 in the aggregate pursuant to this _Section 3.10_. For clarity, if
in a given calendar year more than one of the Net Sales Milestones set forth
in subsection (ii), (iii), or (iv), above, is achieved, then Buyer will pay
each of the Milestone Payment Amounts set forth subsections (ii), (iii), or
(iv), as applicable, with respect to each such corresponding Net Sales
Milestone that is achieved for the first time during such calendar year.

 



 

(b) _Certain Definitions_.

 



 

(i) " _Company Milestone Product_ " means any product for injection (in any
dosage, form, formulation, presentation or package configuration) that
contains fosfomycin as the sole active ingredient.

 



 

(ii) " _First Commercial Sale_ " means the first sale of the Company Milestone
Product in the Territory by a Buyer Related Entity to a Person (other than a
Buyer Related Entity solely for resale) after NDA approval of the Company
Milestone Product has been obtained from the FDA. For the avoidance of doubt,
the sale of a Company Milestone Product for clinical trial or other
developmental purposes, sampling or promotional purposes (in customary
amounts), test marketing, early access programs (including treatment INDs or
protocols, named patient programs

 



      
 

 



 

or compassionate use programs), humanitarian or charitable donations, or
patient assistance programs, in each case where the Company Milestone Product
is delivered for no more than a _de minimis_ charge, shall not constitute a
First Commercial Sale.

 



 

(iii) " _Milestone Payment Amount_ " means the amount that becomes payable
upon the achievement of a Milestone in accordance with _Section 3.10(a)(i)_-
_(iv)_ , as applicable.

 



 

(iv) " _Milestone Period_ " means (a) with respect to the Approval Milestone,
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending upon the earlier of
achievement of the Approval Milestone or the 8th anniversary of the date on
which an NDA for the Company Milestone Product is accepted; and (b) with
respect to the Net Sales Milestones, if the Approval Milestone is achieved
prior to the 20th anniversary of the date on which an NDA for the Company
Milestone Product is accepted, the period beginning on the date of achievement
of the Approval Milestone and ending upon the later of: (i) the earliest date
upon which both of the following have occurred: (A) with respect to any claim
of any issued U.S. Patent Rights within the Company Intellectual Property as
of the Effective Time which claim covers the composition of matter or method
of manufacture or use of the Company Milestone Product in the Territory, each
such claim has expired, been dedicated to the public, been founded invalid or
been found unenforceable, and (B) the expiration of all applicable regulatory
exclusivity periods, including pediatric extensions or data exclusivity, in
the Territory with respect to the Company Milestone Product; or (ii) eight (8)
years after the date of the achievement of the Approval Milestone.

 



 

(v) " _Net Sales_ " means, for the applicable period during the Milestone
Period, the aggregate gross amount (expressed in U.S. dollars and calculated
in accordance with GAAP, applied consistent with past practices of Buyer (if
it, the Final Surviving Corporation or any of its or their Affiliates is the
selling Person) or its or their licensee (if it is the selling Person))
invoiced by Buyer and/or the Final Surviving Corporation and its or their
Affiliates and licensees (collectively, the " _Buyer Related Entities_ ") for
sales in the Territory of Company Milestone Products to a Person who is not a
Buyer Related Entity, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as consistently
applied by Buyer (if it, the Final Surviving Corporation or any of its or
their Affiliates is the selling Person) or its or their licensee (if it is the
selling Person), minus the sum of the following, to the extent actually borne
or incurred by a Buyer Related Entity and not reimbursed:

 



 

A. reasonable and customary freight, postage, shipping and insurance, handling
and other transportation costs to the extent such amounts are included in the
gross invoiced price;

 



 

B. sales, use, value added and other similar Taxes (excluding income,
withholding and similar Taxes) to the extent such amounts are included in the

G. credits or allowances for returns, rejections or recalls; and

There shall be no double counting in determining the foregoing deductions from
gross amounts invoiced to calculate Net Sales. Sales or other commercial
dispositions of a Company Milestone Product between or among Buyer Related
Entities for resale shall be excluded from the computation of Net Sales;
provided, however, that any subsequent sale of a Company Milestone Product by
any Buyer Related Entity to another Person that is not a Buyer Related Entity
shall be included within Net Sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Company
Milestone Product provided for no more than a _de minimis_ charge by a Buyer
Related Entity for clinical trial or other developmental purposes, sampling or
promotional purposes (in customary amounts), test marketing, early access
programs (including treatment INDs or protocols, named patient programs or
compassionate use programs), humanitarian or charitable donations, or patient
assistance programs will not be included in Net Sales.

 



 

(vi) " _Territory_ " means the United States of America and its territories
and possessions, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia.

 



 

(c) _Determining Achievement of Milestones_.

 



 

(i) _Approval Milestone_. Within ten (10) Business Days of the occurrence of
the Approval Milestone during the Milestone Period, Buyer shall provide notice
to the Stockholder Representative that the Approval Milestone has occurred.
From and after the Effective Time and until the earlier of the achievement of
the Approval Milestone or the expiration of the Milestone Period, (A) Buyer
shall provide the Stockholder Representative, on an biannual basis, a written
report covering Buyers activities for the preceding period with respect to
the Company Milestone Products, and (B) upon reasonable request to Buyer by
the Stockholder Representative, made no more than twice per calendar year,
Buyer shall meet with the Stockholder Representative, at Buyers offices or
via telephone or video conference, to provide verbal updates regarding the
development status of the Company Milestone Products.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) _Net Sales Milestone_. No later than sixty (60) days after the end of
each completed fiscal quarter after the First Commercial Sale of a Company
Milestone Product and prior to the earlier of the achievement of the Net Sales
Milestones and the expiration of the Milestone Period, Buyer shall provide the
Stockholder Representative with financial information and supporting
information calculating Net Sales for such fiscal quarter (the " _Net Sales
Report_ "). If Buyer determines that any Net Sales Milestone has been
achieved, Buyer shall, along with the applicable Net Sales Report, provide
notice to the Stockholder Representative that such Net Sales Milestone has
been achieved. For clarity, more than one of the Net Sales Milestones may be
achieved in a calendar year. If the Stockholder Representative does not agree
with Buyers calculation of Net Sales at any time, Buyer shall consider the
Stockholder Representatives comments in good faith, and Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. Following First Commercial Sale, until the earlier of the achievement
of the Net Sales Milestones and the expiration of the Milestone Period, and
for one year thereafter, Buyer shall keep (and shall cause its Affiliates,
including the Final Surviving Corporation, to keep) books and records
pertaining to Net Sales for the prior three (3) calendar years, in sufficient
detail to determine such Net Sales. During the period in which such books and
records must be maintained, the Stockholder Representative shall have the
right to cause the Independent Auditor to audit such books and records to
confirm Buyers calculations of such Net Sales, and such audits may be
exercised during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice (of at
least thirty (30) days) to Buyer, such right to be exercised no more than once
per calendar year; provided, that the Independent Auditor executes a
reasonable confidentiality agreement with Buyer to protect the confidentiality
in such books and records. Such books and records for any period may be
audited no more than once. The Stockholder Representative shall bear the full
cost of such audit unless such audit discloses that the Net Sales reported by
Buyer for any such audited calendar year were more than five percent (5%)
lower than the actual Net Sales in such calendar year, in which case, Buyer
shall reimburse the Stockholder Representative for the reasonable out-of-
pocket cost of the Independent Auditor for the conduct of such audit. The
Independent Auditors calculation of Net Sales pursuant to such an audit shall
be final and binding on the parties hereto.

 



 

(d) _Milestone Payment Procedures_. Within five (5) Business Days following
the Stockholder Representatives receipt of notice from Buyer (or, in the case
of a Net Sales Milestone, if applicable, subject to a final determination by
the Independent Auditor pursuant to an audit described in _Section
3.10(c)(ii)_) that either the Approval Milestone or a Net Sales Milestone has
been achieved, or, if applicable, that a Milestone Acceleration or
Continuation Event has occurred and Buyer has elected to pay an Acceleration
Payment with respect to a particular Milestone, Buyer shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds or in Buyer
Ordinary Shares (as the case may be), the applicable Milestone Payment Amount
payable in connection with the occurrence of such event pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, for distribution to the Pre-Closing Holders who have
complied with _Sections 3.2(b), 3.2(c) and 3.2(d)_, as applicable (
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in lieu of
any Buyer Ordinary Shares otherwise issuable in respect of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Options or the Company Warrant, or to any Cash-Out Holder, as a Milestone
Payment a cash amount equal to the number of such Buyer Ordinary Shares
multiplied by the Milestone Share Price shall be paid, and _provided further_
that amounts payable in respect of Company Options shall be paid by the
Exchange Agent to the Final Surviving Corporation for payment through its
payroll system within three (3) Business Days of the date the Exchange Agent
delivers such funds to the Final Surviving Corporation), and, if applicable,
any recipients of Transaction Expenses, in accordance with an updated Payment
Spreadsheet to be provided by the Stockholder Representative to the Exchange
Agent; provided, in the case of the Milestone Payment for the Approval
Milestone, that if the deadline under this _Section 3.10(d)_ for delivery of
such Milestone Payment would otherwise occur prior to the end of the Milestone
Share Price Measurement Period, the deadline for Buyer to deliver such
Milestone Payment under this _Section 3.10(d)_ shall instead be the second
(2nd) Business Day following the expiration of such Milestone Share Price
Measurement Period.

 



 

(e) _Milestone Achievement Efforts_. Following the Effective Time, Buyer and
its Affiliates shall act in good faith and shall use Milestone Reasonable
Efforts to cause each of the Milestones to be achieved during the applicable
Milestone Period. " _Milestone Reasonable Efforts_ " means the performance of
commercially reasonable efforts that are at least commensurate with the level
of efforts that Buyer devotes in pursuing the NDA approval or
commercialization in the Territory, as applicable to the relevant Milestone,
of its own product candidates of similar market potential, profit potential or
strategic value at a similar stage in its lifecycle, taking into consideration
the safety and efficacy of the product, the risks inherent in the development
and commercialization of the product, its competitiveness compared to
alternative products (other than those developed by the Buyer Related
Entities), the proprietary position of the product (including scope and
duration of relevant Patent Rights), the scope of marketing approval, the
regulatory status of the product, and whether the product is subject to a
clinical hold, recall or market withdrawal. Buyer further agrees not to take
any action for the primary purpose of undermining the achievement of the
unachieved Milestones. Without limiting Buyers obligations under this
_Section 3.10(e)_, Buyer does not represent or warrant that the development,
NDA approval or commercialization of the Company Milestone Product in the
Territory will be successful.

 



 

(f) _Milestone Acceleration or Continuation Event_. Notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a
Milestone Acceleration or Continuation Event occurs during an applicable
Milestone Period (i) at any time before the Approval Milestone has been
achieved or (ii) at any time before all of the Net Sales Milestones have been
achieved, Buyer may, in its sole discretion upon the determination of its
Board of Directors, elect to pay with respect to any Milestone not yet
achieved, on a Milestone-by-Milestone basis and in accordance with _Section
3.10(d)_ above, an amount equal to the unpaid Milestone Payment with respect
to such Milestone (an " _Acceleration Payment_ "), the payment of which shall
satisfy all payment obligations of Buyer with respect to such Milestone
Payment, provided that such election shall only be effective if notice thereof
is provided to the Stockholder Representative within twenty (20) Business Days
after the applicable Milestone Acceleration or Continuation Event. In the
event that no such notification has been provided within such twenty
(20)-Business

 



      
 

 



 

Day period, or such notification has been provided but there remain unpaid
Milestone Payments, the terms and provisions of this _Section 3.10_ shall
continue in accordance with their terms and Buyer shall require the relevant
successor of Buyer (the " _Successor Entity_ "), if applicable (whether direct
or indirect, by purchase, merger, sale of stock or assets, consolidation or
otherwise), pursuant to the Milestone Acceleration or Continuation Event, to
assume and agree, in writing, to perform _Section 3.10_ of this Agreement, in
the same manner and to the same extent that Buyer would have been required to
perform if no such succession had taken place; _provided_ that for purposes of
the definition of Milestone Reasonable Efforts with respect to such Successor
Entity, the reference to "Buyer" in such definition shall still be deemed to
refer to Buyer, and not to the Successor Entity, as Buyer existed prior to any
transactions related to the acquisition of any rights or obligations by the
Successor Entity. For purposes of this _Section 3.10_, a " _Milestone
Acceleration or Continuation Event_ " shall mean any of the following events:
(w) a sale, license, conveyance, assignment or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of Buyer and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis (other than to Buyer or any Subsidiary (direct or indirect)
of Buyer), (x) a merger or consolidation in which Buyer is not the surviving
entity and in which the stockholders of Buyer immediately prior to such
consolidation or merger own less than fifty percent (50%) of the surviving
entitys voting power immediately after the transaction, (y) a reverse merger
in which Buyer is the surviving entity but the shares of Buyers common stock
outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the
merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or
otherwise, and in which the stockholders of Buyer immediately prior to such
reverse merger own less than fifty percent (50%) of Buyers voting power
immediately after the transaction and (z) a sale, exclusive license,
conveyance, assignment or other disposition of all of Buyers and its
Affiliates interest, directly or indirectly, in the Company Milestone
Products in the Territory.

 



 

(g) With respect to Milestone Payments payable in Buyer Ordinary Shares, the
number of Buyer Ordinary Shares to be issued in respect thereof shall be
determined by dividing the amount of such payment obligation by the volume
weighted average price of a Buyer Ordinary Share over the twenty (20) trading-
day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the date of issuance of such
shares, as reported by Bloomberg with any fractional amounts rounded down,
provided that in the case of the Milestone Payment for the Approval Milestone
the applicable period for measuring the volume weighted average price of a
Buyer Ordinary Share shall instead be the twenty (20) trading-day period
commencing on the tenth (10th) trading day prior to public announcement by
Buyer of the achievement of the Approval Milestone (such price, the "
_Milestone Share Price_ " and such applicable measurement period, the "
_Milestone Share Price Measurement Period_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement (but subject to the Share Cap), Buyer
shall have right to settle any payment obligation under this _Section 3.10_
(other than amounts payable in respect of Company Options and the Company
Warrant and to any Cash-Out Holder, which shall in all events be paid in cash)
by issuing a number of Buyer Ordinary Shares calculated in the manner
specified in the preceding sentence; provided, however, that the Buyer shall
not settle any payment obligation under this _Section 3.10_ in Buyer Ordinary
Shares if the settlement in shares would cause the Company to be an
expatriated entity within the

 



      
 

 



 

meaning of Section 7874 of the Code.

 



 

(h) The parties understand and agree that (i) the rights of the Pre-Closing
Holders under this _Section 3.10_ shall not be evidenced by a certificate,
(ii) the Pre-Closing Holders shall have no rights as a security holder of the
Final Surviving Corporation or Buyer (or any of their respective Affiliates)
as a result of their respective rights under this _Section 3.10_ and (iii) no
right to receive any Milestone Payment may be assigned or otherwise
transferred by any Pre-Closing Holder (other than (x) by will or the laws of
descent and distribution or (y) to an Affiliate of such Pre-Closing Holder, in
each case in accordance with applicable Law) without the prior written consent
of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and any purported assignment or transfer in the absence of such
consent shall be null and void _ab initio_.

 



 

3.11 _Legend_. All certificates representing any Buyer Ordinary Shares that
may be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall have restrictive legends in the
following form:

 



 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR QUALIFIED
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS (THE "STATE ACTS"), HAVE BEEN
ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT AND QUALIFICATION UNDER THE STATE ACTS OR EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH
REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF THE
SECURITIES ACT, E.G. THE EXEMPTION AFFORDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER).

 



 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO AN AGREEMENT
RESTRICTING THE VOTING AND TRANSFER THEREOF (A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED
UPON WRITTEN REQUEST FROM THE COMPANY), AND BY ACCEPTING ANY INTEREST IN SUCH
SHARES THE PERSON ACCEPTING SUCH INTEREST SHALL BE DEEMED TO AGREE TO AND
SHALL BECOME BOUND BY THE PROVISIONS OF THAT AGREEMENT.

 



 

3.12 _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional Buyer Ordinary Shares will be
issued to the Pre-Closing Holders under this Agreement, and any fraction of a
Buyer Ordinary Share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

 



 

3.13 _Issuance of Shares after Closing_. Any issuance of Holdback Shares and
any Milestone Payment paid in Buyer Ordinary Shares shall be treated as
comprised of two components, a principal component and an interest component,
the amounts of which shall be determined as provided in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.483-4(b) example (2), using the 3-month test rate of interest
provided for in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1274-4(a)(1)(ii) employing the
semiannual compounding period. As to each such payment of Buyer Ordinary
Shares to each Pre-Closing Holder, Buyer Ordinary Shares representing the
principal component (with a value equal to the principal component) and Buyer
Ordinary Shares representing the interest component (with a

 



      
 

 



 

value equal to the interest component) shall be represented by separate share
certificates or book entry accounts.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV.** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as set forth in the schedules to this Agreement (each, a " _Schedule_ "

applicable) is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership of its property or the character of its activities is
such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing, as

the ordinary course of business with customers, vendors, lessors, lenders and
the like that do not relate primarily to Taxes.

which it has filed (or been required to file) consolidated, combined, unitary
or similar Tax Returns, other than a group of which the common parent is the

expired, and (iii) complete and correct copies of all material agreements,
rulings, settlements or other Tax documents with or from any Governmental

market value of the total outstanding stock of the Company.

 



 

(s) None of the Companys shareholders will be a five-percent transferee
shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii))

 **ARTICLE V.** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND MERGER SUBS**

 



 

Except: (a) as disclosed in the Buyer SEC Documents at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the date hereof, and that is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure to be applicable to the representation and warranty set forth
herein (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the
captions "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," but including any historical
statements in such sections, and any other disclosures contained or referenced
therein of information, factors, or risks that are predictive, cautionary, or
forward-looking in nature); or (b) as set forth in the correspondingly
numbered Section of the Disclosure Schedules; Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger
Sub II hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

 



 

5.1 _Corporate Organization_. Buyer has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing as a public limited company under the Laws of Ireland. Merger Sub I
has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub II has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub I is a corporation newly formed
for the sole purpose of effecting the First Merger, and has not engaged in any
activity other than as contemplated in this Agreement. Each of Buyer and each
of the Merger Subs has the requisite power and authority _to_ own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted. The
copies of the organizational documents of each of Buyer and Merger Subs
previously delivered by Buyer to the Company and as most recently filed with
the Buyer SEC Documents are true and complete. Each of Buyer and each of the
Merger Subs is duly licensed or qualified and (where applicable) in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the
character of its activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or
qualified or in good standing, as applicable, except where failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer
owns, beneficially and of record, all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of each of the Merger Subs, free and clear of all Liens.

 



 

5.2 _Subsidiaries_. Each Subsidiary of the Buyer, along with its jurisdiction
of incorporation, formation or organization, (including each entity that has
been a Subsidiary of the Buyer within the prior two (2) years), as well as the
jurisdiction of incorporation, formation or organization of

 



 



      
 

 



 

each entity, is set forth in _Schedule 5.2_. Each of such Subsidiaries is a
legal entity that has been duly formed and is validly existing, and where
applicable, as an entity in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of formation.

 



 

5.3 _Due Authorization_. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II has all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
(subject to the consents, approvals, authorizations and other requirements
described in _Section 5.5_) to perform all obligations to be performed by it
hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II and the consummation by them of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized and approved by the
boards of directors of each of Buyer, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, and no
other corporate proceeding on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
is necessary to authorize this Agreement (other than the adoption of this
Agreement by Buyer in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II, which adoption will occur immediately following the execution
of this Agreement by Merger Subs). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of Buyer and Merger Subs and (assuming this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and
the Stockholder Representative) constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Buyer and Merger Subs, enforceable against Buyer and
Merger Subs in accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exception.

 



 

5.4 _No Conflict._ Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4_ , and subject to the
receipt of the consents, approvals, authorizations and other requirements set
forth in _Section 5.5_ or on _Schedule 5.5_ the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Buyer and Merger Subs and the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not, as of the Closing, (a)
violate any provision of, or result in the breach of any applicable Law to
which Buyer or either Merger Sub is subject or by which any property or asset
of Buyer or either Merger Sub is bound, (b) conflict with or violate any

restrictions that may be applicable to information furnished to the Company by
third parties that may be in the Companys possession from time to time, and
except for any information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or
other privilege from disclosure, prior to the Closing, the Company shall
afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such manner as to not
interfere with the normal operation of the Company to its properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, records and appropriate officers and
employees of the Company, and shall furnish such representatives with
financial and operating data and other information concerning the affairs of
the Company, in each case, as such representatives may reasonably request for
the sole purpose of preparing for the operation of the business of the Company
following the Closing or in connection with pursuing a firm commitment
underwritten public offering of Buyer Ordinary Shares (the " _Public Offering_
"); _provided_ , that such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with
all applicable Laws, shall only be upon reasonable notice and shall be at
Buyers sole cost and expense. All information obtained by Buyer, Merger Subs
and their respective representatives shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company shall provide (and shall cause its agents and advisors
to provide) such reasonable cooperation to Buyer in connection with the Public
Offering as Buyer may reasonably request, including providing all information
concerning the Company or its business that Buyer (or any underwriters in the
Public Offering) reasonably determines is necessary to review in due diligence
in connection with the Public Offering or to include in one or more
prospectuses or other offering documents in connection therewith (and
consenting to the public disclosure thereof and to the filing thereof with the
SEC or any other applicable Governmental Authority, subject to the Companys
reasonable request that Buyer seek any available confidential treatment
thereof).

 



 

6.3 _Information Statement_. Reasonably promptly following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Merger Consent (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days), the Company shall, in accordance with applicable
Law, including Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL and the Company Charter and
the Company Bylaws, promptly send an information statement (the " _Information
Statement_ ") to each Company Stockholder that has not theretofore executed a
written consent in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, notifying such Company Stockholder that (i) action has been taken by
less than unanimous written consent of the Company Stockholders, (ii) this
Agreement was duly adopted and (iii) appraisal rights are available pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Law of any other applicable jurisdiction. Such notice shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and shall at all relevant times be in
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL and other applicable Law. The Company,
acting through its Board of Directors, shall include in the Information
Statement the unanimous recommendation of its Board of Directors that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the First Merger. The Company shall ensure that the
Information Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading (provided that the Company shall not be responsible for the
accuracy or completeness of any information concerning the Buyer or Merger
Subs furnished by the Buyer in writing for inclusion in the Information
Statement).

 



 

6.4 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Upon the Buyers written request, prior to

intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, or any successor
statute, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. Upon the termination of such plans, the Company shall provide the Buyer
with evidence that such 401(k) plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Companys board of directors not later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

6.5 _Section 280G Vote_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit
to a stockholder vote, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval
requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, the right of any "disqualified individual"
(as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive any and all payments
(or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code) to the extent necessary so that no payment received by such
"disqualified individual" shall be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)
of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code).
Such vote shall establish each disqualified individuals right to the payment
or other compensation, and the Company shall obtain any required waivers or
consents from the disqualified individual prior to the vote. In addition, the
Company shall provide adequate disclosure to Company stockholders that hold
voting Company Capital Stock of all material facts concerning all payments to
any such disqualified individual that, but for such vote, could be deemed
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that satisfies
Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Prior to the vote, Buyer and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable right to review and comment on all documents required to be
delivered to the Company stockholders in connection with such vote and any
required disqualified individual waivers or consents, and the Company shall
reflect all reasonable comments of Buyer thereon. Buyer and its counsel shall
be provided copies of the approval documents executed by the stockholders and
the waivers executed by the disqualified individuals in connection with the
vote.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.** ** 
COVENANTS OF BUYER**

 



 

7.1 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Buyer agrees that
it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer
and employee of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted in the Companys
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement (including promptly advancing expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted thereunder). Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall cause the Company for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time (i) to maintain provisions in its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Companys former and current officers, directors and
employees that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
the Company, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) not to
amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except
as required by Law.

 



 

(b) The Company shall obtain at or prior to the Closing a prepaid, non-
cancelable six-year "tail" policy containing terms not less favorable than the
terms of the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the cost of which, to the extent not paid prior to the
Closing, shall be a Transaction Expense).

 



 

(c) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as
provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 7.1_ (an
" _Indemnified Person_ ") may at any time be entitled. No right or remedy
herein conferred by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other
right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at Law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent or subsequent
assertion of any other right or remedy.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.1_ shall survive the consummation of the First Merger indefinitely
and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Buyer and the Final Surviving Corporation. In the event that Buyer or the
Final Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Final Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.1._

 



 

(e) Buyer shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall
cause the Final Surviving Corporation to honor, each of the covenants in this
_Section 7.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

7.2 _Employment Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Final
Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor and perform in accordance with their
terms all Company Benefit Plans, including, without limitation, all
employment, severance, bonus (including the Companys 2018 Corporate Bonus
Plan pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.2(d)_ below), transaction, incentive
and other compensation arrangements with any employee or independent
contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and references therein to the
Company shall thereafter be deemed references to the Final Surviving
Corporation. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "Change in Control" or
"Change of Control" for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans, including,
without limitation, all employment, severance, bonus, transaction, incentive
and other compensation arrangements with any employee or independent
contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide, or shall cause the Final
Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company immediately
prior to the Closing who continues in employment with Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Final Surviving Corporation) immediately following the Closing
(such employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as the
Continuing Employee remains employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Final Surviving Corporation) during such period, (i) a base
salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, that is not less than the base
salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) bonus or incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable than the bonus or incentive
opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date (provided, however, that in light of the bonus amount due to
Continuing Employees upon a Corporate Transaction under the Companys 2018
Corporate Bonus Plan, there shall be no requirement that Buyer or its
Affiliates cause the Final Surviving Corporation to provide any Continuing
Employee with any further bonus or incentive opportunity for the 2018 fiscal
year) and (iii) employee and fringe benefits (including, health, welfare,
retirement and severance benefits) that are at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing.

 



 

(c) Effective as of the Closing and while each Continuing Employee remains
employed by Final Surviving Corporation, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall recognize, or shall cause the Final Surviving
Corporation to recognize, to the same extent recognized by the Company prior
to the Closing, each Continuing Employees employment or service with the
Company (including any current or former Affiliate of the Company or any
predecessor of the Company) prior to the Closing for all purposes, including
for purposes of determining, as applicable, eligibility for participation,
vesting and entitlement of the Continuing Employee under all employee benefit
plans maintained by the Final Surviving Corporation, Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer, including vacation plans or arrangements, retirement plans and any
severance or welfare plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any
employee benefits plan of Buyer or its Affiliates that is a defined benefit
pension plan), except to the extent such

 



       
 

 



 

recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective as of the Closing
and thereafter while each Continuing Employee remains employed by Final
Surviving Corporation, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods, actively at work requirements,
evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations under
any health or similar plan of the Final Surviving Corporation, Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, except to the extent that any waiting period, exclusions
or requirements still applied to such Continuing Employee under the comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Closing, and (ii) fully credit each Continuing Employee
with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under
the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of the Company
prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for the
purpose of determining the extent to which such Continuing Employee has
satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
such plan year under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit
plan of the Final Surviving Corporation, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan.

 



 

(d) To the extent such amounts are not paid by Company prior to the Closing,
immediately following the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Final
Surviving Corporation to, pay the bonus amounts set forth on _Schedule 7.2(d)_
pursuant to the "Corporate Transaction Provisions" of the Companys 2018
Corporate Bonus Plan (triggered by the Merger) to each of the Companys
employees who were employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing, which payments shall be paid in cash in accordance with the terms of
the Companys 2018 Corporate Bonus Plan (the " _2018 Company Bonus Payments_
").

 



 

(e) The Company and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 7.2_ are included for the sole benefit of Buyer and the
Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied (i)
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (ii)
shall limit the right of Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Closing
Date, or (iii) shall confer upon any other Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (including any equity holder, any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company, or any participant
in any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)), any right to continued
or resumed employment or recall, any right to compensation or benefits, or any
third-party beneficiary or other right of any kind or nature whatsoever.

 



      
 

 



 

7.3 _Retention of Books and Records_. Buyer shall cause the Final Surviving
Corporation to retain all books, ledgers, files, reports, plans, operating
records and any other material documents pertaining to the Company in
existence at the Closing that are required to be retained under current
retention policies for at least a period of seven (7) years from the Closing
Date or, if longer, until the last Milestone Payment has been made, and to
make the same available after the Closing for inspection and copying by the
Stockholder Representative or its representatives at the Stockholder
Representatives expense, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable advance notice.

 



 

7.4 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Until the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, contact or communicate
with the employees, collaborators, suppliers, distributors or licensors of the
Company or any other Persons having a business relationship with the Company,
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the Company.

 



 

7.5 _Registration Rights_.

 



 

(a) _Registration Procedures and Expenses_. Buyer will file with the SEC,
within thirty (30) days following the delivery of any Buyer Ordinary Shares in
respect of any Milestone Payment, a registration statement on Form S-1, Form
S-3 or other applicable form available to Buyer (the " _Registration
Statement_ ") covering the resale to the public of all Buyer Ordinary Shares
issued or to be issued to the Pre-Closing Holders pursuant to any Milestone
Payment paid in Buyer Ordinary Shares under this Agreement (the " _Registrable
Securities_ "). Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as
practicable. Within thirty (30) days of any subsequent issuance by Buyer of
Buyer Ordinary Shares to the Pre-Closing Holders pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, Buyer will amend such Registration Statement (or, if applicable,
file a new Registration Statement) covering the resale to the public of all
such additional Buyer Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this _Section 7.5(a)_, Buyer may
postpone the filing or the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of a
supplement or amendment thereto or suspend the use of an effective
Registration Statement if and to the extent the Board of Directors of Buyer
determines in good faith that such Registration Statement would (i) reasonably
be expected to materially impede, delay, interfere with or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on any material acquisition of assets (other than in
the ordinary course of business), merger, consolidation, tender offer,
financing or any other material business transaction by Buyer or (ii) require
disclosure of information that has not been, and is otherwise not required to
be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which Buyer, after
consultation with outside counsel to Buyer, believes would materially and
adversely affect Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may not invoke
this right more than twice, or for an aggregate period of more than 120 days,
in any twelve (12) month period.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification_. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Pre-
Closing Holder whose Buyer Ordinary Shares issued hereunder are included in
the Registration Statement against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities to which such Pre-Closing Holder may become subject by reason of
any untrue statement of a material fact

 



      
 

 



 

contained in the Registration Statement or any omission to state therein a
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities arise out of or are based upon information furnished to Buyer by
or on behalf of a Pre-Closing Holder for use in the Registration Statement.
Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense and settlement of any claim
or suit for which Buyer may be responsible for indemnification under this
Section.

 



 

7.6 _Conduct of Business of Buyer_. From the date of this Agreement through
the Closing, Buyer shall, except as would constitute a violation of applicable
Law, as contemplated by this Agreement or as consented to by the Company in
writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld,
delayed or denied), use commercially reasonable efforts to operate its
business in the ordinary course in accordance with past practice.

 



 

7.7 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Buyer Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement to be
approved for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to official notice of
issuance, no later than the date of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement.

 



 

7.8 _Shareholder Approval_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain Shareholder Approval. In furtherance (and without limitation) of the
foregoing, the Buyer will hold a meeting of shareholders no later than
December 31, 2018 at which a proposal for obtaining Shareholder Approval shall
be considered, with, subject to compliance with its fiduciary duties, the
recommendation of Buyers Board of Directors that such proposal be approved,
and Buyer shall solicit proxies from its shareholders in connection therewith
in the same manner as any other management proposals in such proxy statement
and all management-appointed proxyholders shall vote their proxies in
accordance with the recommendation of Buyers Board of Directors.

8.3 _Further Assurances._ Each party hereto agrees that, from time to time
after the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver, or cause its Affiliates
to execute and deliver, such further instruments, and take (or cause its
Affiliates to take) such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry
out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 



 

8.4 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by, on behalf of or with
respect to, the Company, the Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared, in
a manner consistent with past practice, and timely file or cause to be timely
filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all such
Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, and
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent
with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law), and file or cause to be
filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax
Returns that relate to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date but
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for a Straddle
Period; _provided_ , that Buyer shall in the case of any such Tax Returns (i)
provide any such Tax Returns to the Stockholder Representative for review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) for timely filing of any such income Tax Returns, or if
such Tax Return is not an income Tax Return, as promptly as practical prior to
the due date (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) for timely
filing of such Tax Return, and (ii) consider in good faith revisions to such
income and other material Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the portion of any Tax that is
allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date will
be: (i) in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes,
determined as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close
of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit or cause the Company or any of
Buyers Affiliates to, (i) file or amend (or cause to be filed or amended) any
Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Tax
Returns required to be filed by Buyer as described in _Section 8.4(a)_), (ii)
extend or waive the applicable statute of limitations for the assessment of
any Tax or deficiency relating to any Pre-Closing Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Period, (iii) make (or cause to be made) or change (or cause to be changed)
any Tax election or accounting method that has retroactive effect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (iv) engage in any voluntary disclosures or discussions
with any Tax Authority in respect of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that would reasonably be expected to result in any Tax liability for
which any Buyer Indemnified Party may be indemnified pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes
of this Agreement, any Taxes attributable to any transaction that Buyer causes
the Company to engage in after the Closing on the Closing Date that is both
outside the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement
shall be allocated to the Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Pre-Closing Holders shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes
(including any interest paid thereon by the applicable Governmental Authority)
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such Taxes were paid by the
Company prior to the Closing which refund is actually received by Buyer or its
Affiliates after the Closing, in each case except for any refund (i) that
results from the carry back of any Tax credit or attribute from any Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) that was included in Closing Date Net
Working Capital. Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Stockholder
Representative for payment to the Pre-Closing Holders in accordance with the
Payment Spreadsheet any amount to which the Pre-Closing Holders are entitled
pursuant to the prior sentence within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of
the applicable refund by Buyer or its Affiliates net of any reasonable costs
to Buyer or its Affiliates attributable to obtaining and the receipt of such
refund. To the extent requested by the Stockholder Representative, Buyer will
reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder Representative (at the Pre-Closing
Holders expense) in obtaining such refund, including through the filing of
amended Tax Returns for periods ending before or on the Closing Date or refund
claims. To the extent such refund is subsequently disallowed or required to be
returned to the applicable Governmental Authority, the Pre-Closing Holders
shall repay the amount of such refund, together with any interest, penalties
or other additional amounts imposed by such Governmental Authority, to Buyer
within ten (10) Business Days of such refund being disallowed or required to
be returned to the applicable Governmental Authority.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other parties such cooperation, documentation and information
relating to the Company or its assets as such parties may reasonably request
and that is reasonably necessary in (A) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund, (B) determining a liability for Taxes or a right
to refund of Taxes, (C) making any Tax election, or (D) prosecuting or
defending any audit, examination, contest, litigation, or other proceeding
relating to any Tax. In this regard, the parties hereto shall retain (or cause
to be retained) all books and records with respect to Tax matters of the
Company which are or may be pertinent to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative shall have no right to review or obtain information with
respect to any combined or consolidated Tax Return of Buyer except to the
extent the relevant information relates solely to the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) If, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or the Final Surviving Corporation
receives notice of any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or
judicial proceeding involving Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period which could reasonably be expected to result in any Tax liability for
which any Buyer Indemnified Party may be indemnified pursuant to this
Agreement (a " _Tax Contest_ "), then within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of such notice, Buyer shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such
notice, _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to notify the Stockholder
Representative will not relieve the Pre-Closing Holders of any liability they
may have to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, except to the extent the defense of
such Tax Contest is prejudiced by Buyers failure to give such notice. Buyer
shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Contest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall keep the Stockholder
Representative (who may participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense)
reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax Contest and shall not effect
any settlement or compromise of such Tax Contest without obtaining the
Stockholder Representatives prior written consent thereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event of
any conflict between the provisions of this _Section 8.4_ and _Section 11.3_
with respect to Tax Contests, the provisions of this _Section 8.4_ shall
control.

 



 

(g) Transfer Taxes shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Pre-
Closing Holders. Buyer will timely file all Tax Returns and other
documentation necessary with respect to all Transfer Taxes and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the parties hereto will cooperate in the execution
of such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(h) For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and to not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "). The parties adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations. Each of the parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify for the Intended
Tax Treatment. None of the parties shall (and each of the parties shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to take any
action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to
qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. The parties shall consider in good
faith such amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required to cause
the Merger to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment (it being understood that
no party will be required to agree to any such amendment). The parties shall
not file any U.S. federal, state or local Tax Return in a manner that is
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment of the Merger unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



 

8.5 _Private Placement._ Each of the Company and Buyer shall take all
reasonably necessary action on its part such that the issuance of Buyer
Ordinary Shares pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act in compliance with Rule 506 of
Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior to the Closing Date the Company shall (a) provide each
Company Stockholder with an investor questionnaire in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and (b) provide each Company Stockholder with either the
Support Agreement or, to the extent such Company Stockholder is not

 



      
 

 



 

a party to the Support Agreement, an Investment Agreement in the form attached
hereto as _Annex D_.

action. The provisions of this _Section 10.2_, _Article XI_ and _Article
XII_, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this

that, by its terms, provides for performance following the Closing shall
survive for the period provided in such covenant, if any, or until such

following the Closing) may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless on or
before the Survival Expiration Date, such claim is asserted by written notice
in accordance with this _Article XI_, and if such a notice is given, the
Survival Expiration Date with respect to such claim shall continue until the
claim is fully and finally resolved.

 



 

11.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 11.4_, from and after the Closing, the Pre-Closing
Holders, severally (and not jointly) in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company, the Final Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries) and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives (collectively,
the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") and will compensate and reimburse the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any
Buyer Indemnified Party (regardless of whether such Losses relate to any
Third-Party Claim) resulting from, relating to or constituting: (i) any breach
of any representation or warranty the Company has made in _Article IV_ of
this Agreement or in the Closing Certificate; (ii) any breach by the Company
of any covenant or agreement of the Company in this Agreement that, by its
terms, provides for performance by the Company prior to the Closing (other
than _Section 6.2_ or _8.1_ ); (iii) any Closing Indebtedness and any Excess
Transaction Expenses, in each case to the extent in excess of the amounts
included in the calculation of the Adjustment Amount; (iv) any inaccuracy in
the Payment Spreadsheet, as in effect from time to time; (v) any failure of
any Company Stockholder to have good, valid and marketable title to the issued
and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock issued in the name of such
Company Stockholder, free and clear of all Liens; (vi) any untrue statement of
a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission to
state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading to the extent such losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities arise out of or are based upon information furnished
by the Pre-Closing Holders to Buyer for use in the Registration Statement and
(vii) the following Taxes: (A) any Taxes for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date due and payable by the Company;
(B) any Taxes for which the Company has any liability under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or under any comparable or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Laws as a result of being a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group on or prior to the Closing
Date; (C) any Taxes for which the Company has any liability as a transferee or
successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation or otherwise, which Tax is

 



      
 

 



 

attributable to the operations of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date
or an event or transaction occurring before the Closing; and (D) any Transfer
Taxes that are the responsibility of the Pre-Closing Holders pursuant to
_Section 8.4(g)_.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 11.4_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative and the
Pre-Closing Holders (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") and
will compensate and reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties for any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party (regardless of
whether such Losses relate to any Third-Party Claim) resulting from, relating
to or constituting: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Buyer or
Merger Subs has made in this Agreement or in the Buyer Closing Certificate or
(ii) any breach by (A) Buyer or Merger Subs of any covenant or agreement of
Buyer or Merger Subs in this Agreement or (B) the Company of any covenant or
agreement of the Company in this Agreement that, by its terms, provides for
performance by the Company after the Closing.

 



 

(c) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this _Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it.

 



 

11.3 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If any Action is commenced or threatened by a third party that may give
rise to a claim for indemnification (an " _Third-Party Claim_ ") by any Person
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the
Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing
in reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified
Partys good faith estimate of the amount of Losses that may arise from such
Action, and (D) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified
Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify
the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 11.3(a)_ will not relieve the
Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except
to the extent (1) the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify the Indemnitor of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with this
_Section 11.3(a)_ prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

 



 

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Third-Party Claim with counsel of
the Indemnitors choice and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all
respects with the conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor (including the
making of any related claims, counterclaim or cross complaint against any
Person in connection with the Action) and the settlement of such Action by the
Indemnitor; _provided further_ , that (i) the Stockholder Representative may
only assume control of such defense if (A) the maximum amount of Losses
related to such Third-Party Claim, taken together with the

 



      
 

 



 

estimated costs of defense thereof and the Claimed Amount with respect to any
unresolved claims for indemnification then pending, is less than or equal to
the current market value of the available Holdback Shares (calculated based on
the volume weighted average price of a Buyer Ordinary Share over the twenty
(20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior to the date of
such determination, as reported by Bloomberg), and (B) it acknowledges in
writing to the Buyer on behalf of all of the Pre-Closing Holders that any
damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the
Buyer in connection with such Third Party Claim constitute Losses for which
the Buyer shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article XI, and (ii) the
Stockholder Representative may not assume control of (but may participate in,
at its sole cost and expense) the defense of any Third-Party Claim involving
Taxes, any Governmental Authority or criminal liability or in which equitable
relief is sought against the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_further_ that the Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without
the Indemnified Partys prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a
complete release of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor of
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of
a Third-Party Claim and either (A) the Indemnitor does not, within sixty (60)
days after such notice is given, (i) give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of the Action or Actions subject to such
Third-Party Claim and (ii) thereafter promptly assume such defense, (B) the
Stockholder Representative is the Indemnitor and the Indemnitors reasonable
assessment of the likely maximum amount of Losses related to such Action is
greater than the current market value (calculated based on the volume weighted
average price of a Buyer Ordinary Share over the twenty (20) trading-day
period ending three (3) trading days prior to the date of such determination,
as reported by Bloomberg) of the available Holdback Shares and not otherwise
subject to a claim for indemnification under this _Article XI_ or (C) the
Indemnitor does not otherwise have the right to assume defense of such Third-
Party Claim under the terms of this _Article XI_, then the Indemnified Party
may conduct the defense of such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action or Actions without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(c) In circumstances where the Indemnitor assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim in accordance with _Section 11.3(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which case the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstances that may give
rise to claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor
and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the circumstances giving rise to such claim,
(B) including the Indemnified Partys good faith estimate of the amount of
Losses that may arise from such circumstances, and (C) describing in
reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this _Section 11.3(d)_ will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to
give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails

 



      
 

 



 

to notify the Indemnitor of such claim in accordance with this _Section
11.3(d)_ prior to the Survival Expiration Date. If the Indemnitor disputes its
indemnity obligations for any Losses with respect to any such claim, the
parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute
and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to
_Section 13.14_.

 



 

(e) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable claim for
indemnification relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.

 



 

11.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party makes under
this _Article XI_ will be limited as follows:

 



 

(a) _Indemnification Cap_. Claims for indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)_
and _Section 11.2(b)_ shall, if applicable, be subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 11.4_, and then, with respect to claims under _Section
11.2(a)_, such claims for indemnification shall be satisfied (i) first, from
the Holdback Shares, for as long as Holdback Shares remain available to cover
the Buyer Indemnified Parties indemnifiable Losses and (ii) thereafter,
solely for claims in respect of (A) any Fundamental Representations, (B) in
cases of fraud or (C) under clauses (ii) through (vi) of _Section 11.2(a)_,
from Buyers right of set-off (if then available) in accordance with _Section
11.5_. Recovery (1) from the Holdback Shares shall serve as the sole and
exclusive source of indemnification from which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
may collect Losses for which they are entitled to indemnification from the
Pre-Closing Holders under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ (other than for breaches of
Fundamental Representations), and (2) from the Holdback Shares and from
Buyers right of set-off under _Section 11.5_ shall serve as the sole and
exclusive source of indemnification from which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
may collect Losses for which they are entitled to indemnification from the
Pre-Closing Holders in respect of any Fundamental Representations under
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_, in cases of fraud and under clauses (ii) through (vi)
of _Section 11.2(a)_. The aggregate liability of any Pre-Closing Holder under
_Section 11.2(a)_ shall not exceed the aggregate amount of Final Merger
Consideration paid or becomes due and payable to such Pre-Closing Holder under
this Agreement. The aggregate liability of the Buyer (x) under _Section
11.2(b)(i)_, other than for breaches of Fundamental Representations, shall not
exceed a cash amount equal to the number of Holdback Shares multiplied by the
Buyer Share Price, and (y) under _Section 11.2(b)_ shall not exceed the Final
Merger Consideration that is paid or becomes due and payable under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Claims Basket_. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ (except for claims based on
fraud, intentional or knowing misrepresentation or willful breach, and except
for claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations) unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article XI_ exceeds a dollar amount equal to the product of (A)
three quarters of one percent (0.75%) multiplied by (B) the Base Shares
multiplied by (C) the Buyer Share Price

 



      
 

 



 

(the " _Basket Amount_ "), and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be
entitled to indemnification for such Losses to the extent such Losses exceed
the Basket Amount. The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_ unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties for which the
Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XI_ exceeds the Basket Amount, and the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Losses to the extent such
Losses exceed the Basket Amount.

 



 

(c) _Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other Third-Party
Recoveries_. All Losses for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification under this _Article XI_ shall be reduced by the
amount of insurance proceeds to which any Indemnified Party actually received
in respect of any Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party (net of all costs
of collection and increases in insurance premiums). The amount of Losses
recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this Article XI with respect to an
indemnity claim shall be reduced by the amount of any tax savings actually
realized by such Indemnified Party, or any Affiliate thereof, for the tax year
in which such Losses are incurred and all prior tax years, which are clearly
attributable to the Losses to which such indemnity claim relates, net of (i)
all costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
realizing such amount, (ii) any increased tax liability which may result from
the receipt of the indemnity payment relating to such Losses and (iii) any
reduction in or offset to any other tax savings or benefit otherwise available
to such Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof. In the event that any
insurance or other recovery is made by any Buyer Indemnified Party with
respect to any Loss for which such Buyer Indemnified Party has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
insurance or other recovery shall be made promptly by such Buyer Indemnified
Party to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Pre-Closing Holders (
_provided_ , that amounts payable in respect of Company Options shall be paid
to the Final Surviving Corporation for payment through its payroll system) in
accordance with such Pre-Closing Holders Pro Rata Share of such amount.

 



 

(d) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XI_, at the election of the
Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its
claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Losses, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

 



 

(e) _Consequential, Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 11.2_ (other than claims based on fraud, intentional or
knowing misrepresentation or willful breach), no Losses shall be recoverable
under this _Article XI_ that constitute punitive, consequential, incidental,
indirect or special damages or lost profits, unless such Losses (i) are
required to be paid to a third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim for which
the Indemnified Parties were entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XI_ and such claim for indemnification was actually made or (ii)
except for punitive damages, were reasonably foreseeable as of the date hereof
and result proximately from the breach giving rise to such Losses.

 



 

(f) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, recovers Losses in respect of a claim
for indemnification, no other Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, may recover the
same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Materiality Qualifications_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, for purposes of determining the amount of Losses for which any
Buyer Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this _Article
XI_ (but not in determining the existence of a breach of any representation or
warranty), each such representation or warranty shall be deemed to have been
made without any qualifications or limitations as to materiality (including
any qualifications or limitations made by reference to a Material Adverse
Effect).

 



 

11.5 _Set Off_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
with respect to any claim for indemnification in respect of (A) any
Fundamental Representations pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_, (B) in cases of
fraud and (C) under clauses (ii) through (vi) of _Section 11.2(a)_, and only
to the extent that the Holdback Shares are no longer available to satisfy such
claims, Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to set off, in
whole or in part, against any Milestone Payment that becomes due and payable
(but not to the extent previously paid) any amounts owed or claimed in good
faith to be owed by any Pre-Closing Holder to any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection
herewith. Any Buyer Ordinary Share that becomes subject to such set-off right
shall be valued in accordance with Section 3.10(g).

 



 

11.6 _Holdback Shares_. Buyer may reduce the number of Buyer Ordinary Shares
constituting the Holdback Shares to account for any Losses indemnifiable
pursuant to this Article XI accrued and finally determined prior to the time
Buyer is otherwise required to deliver such Holdback Shares pursuant _Section
11.8_. Each Buyer Ordinary Share held as a Holdback Share shall be deemed to
have a value equal to the volume weighted average price of a Buyer Ordinary
Share over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days
prior to the date of release or retention by Buyer of such shares, as reported
by Bloomberg.

 



 

11.7 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to
claims based on fraud and claims for specific performance of covenants,
following the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties and any parties claiming by or
through any party (including the Indemnified Parties) related to or arising
from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement and none of Buyer,
Merger Subs, the Company, the Stockholder Representative or any Pre-Closing
Holder shall have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach
of this Agreement or any other liability arising out of the negotiation, entry
into or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise;
provided that no provision of this sentence shall operate as a release of any
Pre-Closing Holder from any claim against or liability of such Pre-Closing
Holder under any Contract delivered by such Pre-Closing Holder to Buyer or any
Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

11.8 _Issuance of Holdback Shares_. The Buyer Ordinary Shares constituting
Holdback Shares (to the extent so remaining) shall be issued to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with the Payment Spreadsheet on the first Business
Day following the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Holdback
Issuance Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

this _Article XI_ shall have been properly asserted by any Buyer Indemnified
Party in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the Survival Expiration
Date and remain pending on the Holdback Issuance Date (any such claim, a "
_Pending Claim_ "), (i) the number of Holdback Shares issued to the Company
Stockholders shall be the amount of Holdback Shares, _minus_ that number of
Holdback Shares that is equal to the aggregate amount of such Pending Claim
divided by the volume weighted average price of a Buyer Ordinary Share over
the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3) trading days prior such
date of issuance and (ii) any Buyer Ordinary Shares that remain as Holdback
Shares following the Holdback Issuance Date in respect of any such Pending
Claim shall be issued to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the
Payment Spreadsheet promptly upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction
of such Pending Claim to the extent the number of Holdback Shares is not
reduced upon satisfaction of such Pending Claim pursuant to _Section 11.6_;
_provided_ , in any event, that with respect to Holdback Shares that would
otherwise be issuable pursuant to this _Section 11.8_ to Company Stockholders
that are Cash-Out Holders, in lieu of issuing such Holdback Shares to such
Cash-Out Holders, Buyer shall retain such Holdback Shares and pay to such
Cash-Out Holders in lieu thereof an amount in cash equal to the number of such
Holdback Shares multiplied the volume weighted average price of a Buyer
Ordinary Share over the twenty (20) trading-day period ending three (3)
trading days prior to the date of such payment, as reported by Bloomberg.

 



 

11.9 _Tax Treatment_. All amounts paid with respect to claims for
indemnification under _Article XI_ of this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties hereto for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Closing Merger
Consideration to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Law, and shall be
reported as such by the parties hereto on their Tax Returns.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII.** ** 
STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

12.1 _Designation and Replacement of Stockholder Representative_. The parties
hereto have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act
on behalf of holders of the Company Capital Stock, Company Options and the
Company Warrant, as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf
of such Persons, for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the "
_Stockholder Representative_ "). The Company has designated Cam Gallagher as
the initial Stockholder Representative, and requisite approval of this
Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock shall constitute ratification
and approval of such designation. The Stockholder Representative may resign at
any time, and the Stockholder Representative may be removed by the vote of
Persons which collectively owned more than fifty percent (50%) of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and which collectively owned more
than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(or, in the case of a termination of this Agreement, as of such termination)
(the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Stockholder Representative
has resigned or been removed, a new Stockholder Representative shall be
appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Stockholder
Representative. The designation of any Person as the Stockholder
Representative is and shall be considered a power of attorney coupled with an
interest, and, except as set forth in this _Article XII_, such designation is
irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness,
bankruptcy, dissolution or other inability to act of any of the holders of
Company Capital Stock, Company Options or the Company Warrant.

 



      
 

 



 

12.2 _Authority and Rights of the Stockholder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Stockholder Representative shall have such powers and
authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholder Representative
shall have no obligation to act, except as expressly provided herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall
have full power, authority and discretion to (i) give and receive notices and
communications on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders, (ii) estimate and
determine the amounts of Stockholder Representative Expenses and to pay such
Stockholder Representative Expenses in accordance with _Section 3.5_, (iii)
to determine the occurrence of any Milestone, (iv) resolve on behalf of the
Pre-Closing Holders any disputes related to (A) the occurrence of any
Milestone or the payment of any Milestone Payment, (B) the adjustment of the
Closing Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.4_ or (C) any
indemnification in accordance with _Article XI_, (v) commence litigation in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to comply with Governmental
Orders and awards of any arbitrators related thereto, and to settle any such
disputes on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders, (vi) after the Closing, update
the Payment Spreadsheet in accordance with _Section 3.1(e)_ and (vii) after
the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement for and on
behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders. All actions taken by the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with this Agreement shall be binding upon the
Pre-Closing Holders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by each of them. The Stockholder Representative shall have
no liability to Buyer, the Company or any holder of Company Capital Stock,
Company Options or the Company Warrant with respect to actions taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith in its capacity as the Stockholder
Representative (except for those arising out of the Stockholder
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct). The Stockholder
Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction,
and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the
Stockholder Representative, unless the Stockholder Representative is holding
funds delivered to it under _Section 3.5_ and has been provided with other
funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the
Stockholder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Stockholder
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Stockholder Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to engage
such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem
necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
reimbursement for all Stockholder Representative Expenses solely from the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund. The Stockholder Representative shall
be entitled to indemnification by the Pre-Closing Holders against any loss,
liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative (except for those
arising out of the Stockholder Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII.** **

13.1 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may, at any time prior to the

conditions of this Agreement or (without limiting _Section 13.11_) agree to

Agreement. No waiver by any of the parties hereto of any default,
misrepresentation or breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the party
sought to be charged with such waiver.

Buyer may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other parties to
any Successor Entity (which shall be in accordance with _Section 3.10(f)_, if

of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



       
 

 



 

13.4 _Rights of Third Parties_. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other
than the parties hereto, any right or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing (i) in
the event the Closing occurs, the Indemnified Persons (and their successors,

Fund pursuant to _Section 3.5_), shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including all fees of

, that the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor, if any, shall be paid

disclosure is reasonably apparent based on a reading of the disclosure.
Certain information set forth in the Disclosure Schedules is included solely

otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist
between the parties, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the

part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company shall not
restrict the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to terminate

the extent permitted under Section 251(d) of the DGCL.

 



 

13.12 _Publicity_. The Company and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, the Company shall not make any public release or

necessary to comply with applicable Law or securities exchange regulations,
including, if applicable, filing a copy of this Agreement with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission or similar Governmental Authority.
The Company and Buyer and Merger Subs agree to keep the terms of this
Agreement confidential, except to the extent and to the Persons to whom
disclosure is required by applicable Law or securities exchange regulation or
for purposes of compliance with financial reporting obligations; _provided_ ,
that the parties may disclose such terms to their respective employees,
accountants, advisors and other representatives as necessary in connection
with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such
Persons agree to, or are bound by contract or professional or fiduciary
obligations to, keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and so long as
the parties shall be responsible to the other parties hereto for breach of
this _Section 13.12_ or such confidentiality obligations by the recipients of
its disclosure).

 



 

13.13 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held

 



      
 

 



 

invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this
Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid
or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the parties.

 



 

13.14 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) Any Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court
(or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be unavailable, any other court of
the State of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the federal courts
have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and, in each case,
appellate courts therefrom, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any
objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of such Action shall
be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner
permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against
any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments
obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 13.14(a)_.

 



 

(b) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this _Section 13.14(b)_.

 



 

13.15 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each party agrees to waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent any
party hereto brings an Action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an Action to enforce
specifically any provision that by its terms requires performance after the
Closing or expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the Outside Date
shall automatically be extended to (i)

 



      
 

 



 

the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such Action or
(ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Action.

 



 

13.16 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 



 

(a) _Conflicts of Interest_. Buyer acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP ("
_Prior Company Counsel_ ") has, on or prior to the Closing Date, represented
one or more of the Stockholder Representative, one or more Pre-Closing
Holders, the Company and other Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and directors (each such Person, other than the Company, a "
_Designated Person_ ") in one or more matters relating to this Agreement or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter
that may be related to a litigation, claim or dispute arising under or related
to this Agreement or such other agreements or in connection with such
transactions) (each, an " _Existing Representation_ "), and that, in the event
of any post-Closing matters relating to this Agreement or any other agreements
or transactions contemplated hereby (each, a " _Post-Closing Matter_ "), the
Designated Persons may request that Prior Company Counsel represent them in
connection with such matters (including matters which may be adverse to Buyer
or its Affiliates). Accordingly, each of Buyer and the Company hereby (i)
waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause its
Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of
or relating to the representation by Prior Company Counsel of one or more
Designated Persons in connection with one or more Post-Closing Matters (the "
_Post-Closing Representations_ ") _,_ and (ii) agrees that, in the event that
a Post-Closing Matter arises, Prior Company Counsel may represent one or more
Designated Persons in Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company), and even though Prior Company Counsel may (i) have represented
the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute or (ii) be
currently representing Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Each of Buyer and the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the
Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any communication between any Prior Company
Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company
(collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Designated Persons_ "), or any advice given
to any Pre-Closing Designated Person by any Prior Company Counsel, solely to
the extent occurring during (and relating to) one or more Existing
Representations (collectively, " _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation, including matters that may be adverse to
Buyer or the Company (after the Effective Time) or their Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and _Section 13.16(c)_, in the event that a
dispute arises between Buyer or the Company (after the Effective Time), on the
one hand, and a third party other than a Designated Person, on the other hand,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to ) assert the Pre-Closing
Privileges on behalf of the Designated Persons to prevent disclosure of
Privileged Materials to such third party; _provided_ , however that such
privilege may be waived only with the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Privileged Materials_. All Pre-Closing Privileges, and all books and
records and other documents of the Company containing any advice or
communication that is subject to any Pre-Closing Privilege (" _Privileged
Materials_ "), shall be excluded from the purchase, and shall be distributed
to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the applicable Designated
Persons) immediately prior to the Closing with (in the case of such books and
records) no copies retained by the Company. Absent the prior written consent
of the Stockholder Representative, neither Buyer nor (following the Closing)
the Company shall have a right of access to Privileged Materials.

 



 

13.17 _Tax Advice_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that it has not
received and is not relying upon Tax advice from any other party hereto, and
that it has and will continue to consult its own advisors with respect to
Taxes.
