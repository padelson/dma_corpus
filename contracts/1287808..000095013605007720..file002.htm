(e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratios. The numbers of shares of Parent  Common Stock that the holders of the Company Common Stock are entitled to  receive as a result of the Merger shall be equitably adjusted to reflect  appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock  dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible  into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash  dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,  exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock  or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to  the Effective Time.

(b) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or  other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with  respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time  will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company Certificates with  respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon surrender  thereof until the holders of record of such Company Certificates shall  surrender such Company Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following  surrender of any such Company Certificates with a properly completed letter  of transmittal, Parent shall promptly deliver to the record holders  thereof, without interest, the certificates representing shares of Parent  Common Stock issued in exchange therefor and the amount of any such  dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective  Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.   (c) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of  Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the  Company Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it  will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificates  so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for  transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to  Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required  by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent  Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the  Company Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of  Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not  payable.

Each Parent and the Surviving Corporation  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or  otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former  holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted  or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local  or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the  extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be  treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the  person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 1.6, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company nor any  other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common  Stock or Company Common Stock for    4     any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable  abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   1.7 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock.

If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.8 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

As the sole remedy for the indemnity obligations set forth in Article VII, at the Closing, the Persons receiving shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as a result of the Merger shall deposit in escrow twelve percent (12%) of the Base Shares received by such Persons as a result of the Merger (the "Escrow Shares"), which shares shall be allocated among the Persons entitled to receive them in the same proportions as the shares of Parent Common Stock are allocated among them, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement to be entered into at the Closing between Parent, the Company Stockholder Representative (the "Representative") (who shall be Irvin E.

On the first business day following the date (the "Escrow Termination Date") that is thirty (30) days after the date on which Parent has filed its Report on Form 10-K pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), for its 2006 fiscal year, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Basic Indemnity Shares, less any of such shares applied in satisfaction of a claim for indemnification and any of such shares related to a claim for indemnification that is then unresolved, to each such Person in the same proportions as initially deposited in escrow. Any Basic Indemnity Shares held with respect to any unresolved claim for indemnification and not applied as indemnification with respect to such claim upon its resolution shall be delivered to such Persons promptly upon such resolution. All Tax Indemnity Shares and any Basic Indemnity Shares, to the extent not applied in satisfaction of a claim for indemnification, will be so distributed to such Persons on the first business day following December 31, 2010 (the "Tax Escrow Termination Date"), notwithstanding that the claim to which they relate has not been resolved.

(b) Each Stockholder, for itself only, represents and warrants as  follows: (i) all Parent Common Stock to be acquired by such Stockholder  pursuant to this Agreement will be acquired for his, her or its account and  not with a view towards distribution thereof other than, with respect to  Stockholders that are entities, transfers to its stockholders, partners or  members; (ii) it understands that he, she or it must bear the economic risk  of the investment in the Parent Common Stock, which cannot be sold by he,  she or it unless it is registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption  therefrom is available thereunder; (iii) he, she or it has had both the  opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the officers and  directors of Parent and all persons acting on Parent\'s behalf concerning  the business and operations of Parent and to obtain any    6     additional information to the extent Parent possesses or may possess such  information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense  necessary to verify the accuracy of such information; and (iv) he, she or  it has had access to the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this  Agreement. Each Stockholder acknowledges, as to himself, herself or itself  only, that (v) he, she or it is either (A) an "accredited investor" as such  term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act or (B)  a person possessing sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and  business matters to enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of an  investment in Parent; and (vi) he, she or it understands that the  certificates representing the Parent Common Stock to be received by he, she  or it may bear legends to the effect that the Parent Common Stock may not  be transferred except upon compliance with (C) the registration  requirements of the Securities Act (or an exemption therefrom) and (D) the  provisions of this Agreement. Each Stockholder that is an entity, for  itself, represents, warrants and acknowledges, with respect to each holder  of its equity interests, to the same effect as the foregoing provisions of  this Section 1.13(b).

Richter  to represent the interests of the Persons entitled to receive cash and  Parent Common    7     Stock as a result of the Merger for purposes of the Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE VII   INDEMNIFICATION   7.1 Indemnification of Parent.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article VII (including  without limitation the limitations set forth in Section 7.4), Parent, the  Company and their respective representatives, successors and permitted  assigns (the "Parent Indemnitees") shall be indemnified, defended and held  harmless from and against all Losses asserted against, resulting to,  imposed upon, or incurred by any Parent Indemnitee by reason of, arising  out of or resulting from:   (i) subject to the provisions of Section 5.6(b)(iii), the  inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Company  contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, any Schedule or any  certificate delivered by the Company to Parent pursuant to this  Agreement with respect hereto or thereto in connection with the  Closing;   (ii) the non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement  of the Company contained in this Agreement;   (iii) the matters identified with an asterisk in Schedule 2.10 of  the Company Schedule to the extent not reserved for on the interim  balance sheet included in the Unaudited Financial Statements;    48     (iv) the matters referred to in Schedule 2.15 of the Company  Schedule;   (v) the failure of the Company to maintain Workers\' Compensation  Insurance in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; or   (vi) the failure to get consent of a contracting party to either  of the agreements listed on Schedule 2.5 if such consent is required  to (A) allow the continuation of such agreement following the Merger  on the same terms as existed immediately prior to the Merger and/or  (B) waive the right of any contracting party thereto to terminate such  agreement as a result of the Merger.   (b) As used in this Article VII, the term "Losses" shall include all  losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders, penalties,  settlements, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest,  penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses) including  those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of  investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,  proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether  or not ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the purpose of  determining the amount of any Losses (and not for determining any breach)  for which Parent Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to  Article VII, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement  that is qualified by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or  "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such  qualification and without giving effect to such words. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, "Losses" arising from the matters described in Section  7.1(a)(iii) above shall be limited to the amount of any actual judgment or  settlement in excess of reserves provided for in the Unaudited Financial  Statements and shall not include costs, expenses or legal fees incurred in  connection with such matters by the Company, or, following the Merger, the  Surviving Company (but would include any of the legal fees of other parties  ordered or agreed to be paid in such judgment or settlement).   7.2 Indemnification of Third Party Claims. The indemnification obligations and liabilities under this Article VII with respect to actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims brought against Parent by a Person other than the Company (a "Third Party Claim") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:   (a) Notice of Claim. Parent, acting through the Committee, will give  the Representative prompt written notice after receiving written notice of  any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability, obligation or facts  giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a "Notice of Claim") which Notice of  Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the nature of  the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-of-pocket  Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or expenses  which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith), and  (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any  insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under  such insurance, and the Representative shall be entitled to participate in  the defense of Third Party Claim at its expense.   (b) Defense. The Representative shall have the right, at its option  (subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c) below) and at  its own expense, by written notice to Parent, to assume the entire control  of, subject to the right of Parent to participate (at its expense and with  counsel of its choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the  Third Party Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and  shall be entitled to appoint a recognized and reputable counsel reasonably  acceptable to    49     Parent to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense. If the  Representative is permitted and elects to assume the defense of a Third  Party Claim:   (i) the Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend  such Third Party Claim and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of  the status of such defense; provided, however, that in the case of any  settlement providing for remedies other than monetary damages for  which indemnification is provided, Parent shall have the right to  approve the settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed; and   (ii) Parent shall cooperate fully in all respects with the  Representative in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,  including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and Parent  shall make available to the Representative all pertinent information  and documents under its control.   (c) Limitations of Right to Assume Defense. The Representative shall  not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the Third Party  Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,  action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim  seeks an injunction or equitable relief against Parent; or (iii) there is a  reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may materially and  adversely affect Parent other than as a result of money damages or other  money payments.   (d) Other Limitations. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to  provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant  available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any  Third Party Claim by Parent against the Representative and shall not affect  the Representative\'s duty or obligations under this Article VII, except to  the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have adversely  affected the ability of the Representative to defend against or reduce its  liability or caused or increased such liability or otherwise caused the  damages for which the Representative is obligated to be greater than such  damages would have been had Parent given the Representative prompt notice  hereunder. So long as the Representative is defending any such action  actively and in good faith, Parent shall not settle such action. Parent  shall make available to the Representative all relevant records and other  relevant materials required by them and in the possession or under the  control of Parent, for the use of the Representative and its  representatives in defending any such action, and shall in other respects  give reasonable cooperation in such defense.   (e) Failure to Defend. If the Representative, promptly after receiving  a Notice of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively and in  good faith, Parent will (upon further written notice) have the right to  undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim  as it may determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the  Representative shall have the right to approve any settlement, which  approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.    50     (f) Parent\'s Rights. Anything in this Section 7.3 to the contrary  notwithstanding, the Representative shall not, without the written consent  of Parent, settle or compromise any action or consent to the entry of any  judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving  by the claimant or the plaintiff to Parent of a full and unconditional  release from all liability and obligation in respect of such action without  any payment by Parent.   (g) Representative Consent. Unless the Representative has consented to  a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the settlement shall not  be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and such amount shall  be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement   7.3 Insurance Effect. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by insurance, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance; provided that Parent shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under this Article VII in respect of such Losses and the time limitations set forth in Section 7.4 hereof for bringing a claim of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by Parent for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by the Representative. If Parent has received the payment required by this Agreement from the Representative in respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from insurance or other amounts in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in trust for the benefit of the Representative and shall pay to the Representative, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from the Representative pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.   7.4 Limitations on Indemnification.   (a) Survival: Time Limitation. The representations, warranties,  covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any writing required to be  delivered by the Company to Parent in connection with this Agreement  (including the certificate required to be delivered by the Company pursuant  to Section 6.3(a)) shall survive the Closing for the period that ends on  the Escrow Termination Date (the "Survival Period") except that the  representations and warranties contained in Section 2.15 shall survive the  Closing for the period that ends on December 31, 2010 (the "Tax Survival  Period").   (b) Any claim made by a party hereunder for breach of a representation  or warranty prior to the termination of the Survival Period shall be  preserved despite the subsequent termination of the Survival Period and any  claim set forth in a Notice of    51     Claim sent prior to the expiration of the Survival Period shall survive  until final resolution thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately  preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification under this Article VII  shall be brought after the end of the Survival Period or the Tax Survival  Period, as the case may be.   (c) Deductible. No amount shall be payable under Article VII unless  and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise  payable exceeds $500,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event the amount  payable shall only be the amount in excess of the amount of the Deductible,  and, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.5(c), all future  amounts that become payable under Section 7.1 from time to time thereafter.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible shall not apply to Losses  that arise out of a Tax Indemnification Claim or an indemnification claim  made pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(iii) or Section 7.1(a)(v), all of which  shall be indemnifiable as to all Losses that so arise from the first dollar  thereof.   (d) Aggregate Amount Limitation. The aggregate liability for Losses  pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the Escrow Shares and  Parent shall have no claim against the Company\'s stockholders other than  for the Escrow Shares (and any proceeds of the shares or distributions with  respect to the Escrow Shares).   7.5 Exclusive Remedy. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Article VII shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit Parent\'s or Company\'s right to bring any claim, demand or suit against the other party based upon such other party\'s actual fraud or intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission, it being understood that a mere breach of a representation and warranty, without intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission, does not constitute fraud.   7.6 Adjustment to Merger Consideration. Amounts paid for indemnification under Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the value of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued by Parent as a result of the Merger, except as otherwise required by Law.   7.7 Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares. The parties acknowledge that the Representative\'s obligations under this Article VII are solely as a representative of the Company\'s stockholders in the manner set forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify Parent under this Article VII and that the Representative shall have no personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by him in such capacity and that all payments to Parent as a result of such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and to the extent of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of the Representative for attorneys\' fees and other costs shall be borne in the first instance by Parent, which may make a claim for reimbursement thereof against the Escrow Shares upon the claim with respect to which such expenses are incurred becoming an Established Claim (as defined in    52    the Escrow Agreement). The parties further acknowledge that all actions to be taken by Parent pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken on its behalf by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow Agent will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution of all claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, all Escrow Shares remaining in escrow on December 31, 2010 shall be released and delivered to the Persons entitled to them on the following business day.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION   8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company at any time;   (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been  consummated by June 30, 2006 for any reason; provided, however, that the  right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be  available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal  cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before  such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this  Agreement;   (c) by either Parent or the Company if a Governmental Entity shall  have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any  case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise  prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is  final and nonappealable;   (d) by the Company, upon a material breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this  Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have become  untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Article VI  would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such  representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such  breach by Parent is curable by Parent prior to the Closing Date, then the  Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) for  thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice from the Company to  Parent of such breach, provided Parent continues to exercise commercially  reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being understood that the  Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if  it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by  Parent is cured during such thirty (30)-day period);    53     (e) by Parent, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty,  covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this  Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have  become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Article  VI would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time  such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if  such breach is curable by the Company prior to the Closing Date, then  Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) for  thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice from Parent to the  Company of such breach, provided the Company continues to exercise  commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being understood  that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section  8.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such  breach by the Company is cured during such thirty (30)-day period); or   (f) by either Parent or the Company, if, at the Special Meeting  (including any adjournments thereof), this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated thereby shall fail to be approved and adopted by the  affirmative vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock required under  Parent\'s certificate of incorporation, or the holders of 20% or more of the  number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in Parent\'s initial public  offering and outstanding as of the date of the record date of the Special  Meeting exercise their rights to convert the shares of Parent Common Stock  held by them into cash in accordance with Parent\'s certificate of  incorporation.   8.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 above will be effective immediately upon (or, if the termination is pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e) and the proviso therein is applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and the Merger shall be abandoned, except for and subject to the following: (i) Sections 5.6, 5.13, 8.2 and 8.3 and Article X (General Provisions) shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement, including a breach by a party electing to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) caused by the action or failure to act of such party constituting a principal cause of or resulting in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the date stated therein.   8.3 Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.   10.11 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party    60    contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.   10.12 Arbitration. Any disputes or claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Notice of a demand to arbitrate a dispute by either party shall be given in writing to the other at their last known address. Arbitration shall be commenced by the filing by a party of an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in its office in New York City, New York. The arbitration and resolution of the dispute shall be resolved by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA pursuant to AAA rules. The arbitration shall in all respects be governed and conducted by applicable AAA rules, and any award and/or decision shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in New York City or such other place as the parties shall agree. The arbitrator shall supply a written opinion supporting any award, and judgment may be entered on the award in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall pay its own fees and expenses for the arbitration, except that any costs and charges imposed by the AAA and any fees of the arbitrator for his services shall be assessed against the losing party by the arbitrator. In the event that preliminary or permanent injunctive relief is necessary or desirable in order to prevent a party from acting contrary to this Agreement or to prevent irreparable harm prior to a confirmation of an arbitration award, then either party is authorized and entitled to commence a lawsuit solely to obtain equitable relief against the other pending the completion of the arbitration in a court having jurisdiction over the parties. Each party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of New York, New York County, for such purpose. All rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies obtainable from arbitration.
