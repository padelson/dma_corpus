outside legal counsel, that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure
to make a Change in Recommendation and/or to cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Acquisition Proposal would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Laws; (C) the Company delivers to Parent a
written notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") stating that the Company
Board intends to take such action and (in the event the Company Board
contemplates causing the Company to terminate this Agreement and enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, including

 



18  a copy of such Alternative Acquisition Agreement) specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including all information required under
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ (which notice shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation); (D) during the four (4) Business Day period commencing on the
date of Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (as may be extended
pursuant to clause "(F)" below, the "Notice Period"), the Company (1) shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, and (2) shall, and shall cause its representatives to negotiate
with Parent in good faith during the Notice Period (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the
Offer or a possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal
that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior
Proposal; (E) after the expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after taking into
account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that Parent and
Acquisition Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that (1) after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel, such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (2) after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ to enter into
such Alternative Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Laws; and (F) in the event of any material amendment to the terms of any
Superior Proposal (including any amendment to any financial terms or
conditions), the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause "(C)" above and a
new Notice Period under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(i)_ shall commence, during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(i)_ anew with respect to such additional notice,
except that such new Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days; or

 

(ii) make a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal
if: (A) any development or event arises after the date hereof materially
affecting the Company that does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal and was
not known to the Companys Board or reasonably foreseeable on or prior to the
date hereof (any such intervening event unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal
being referred to as an "Intervening Event"); (B) the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a failure to
effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Laws; (C) such Change in Recommendation is not effected prior to the fourth
(4th) Business Day after Parent receives written notice from the Company
confirming that the Company Board intends to effect such Change in
Recommendation (which notice shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation); (D) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement or the Offer or enter into an alternative transaction; and (E)
at the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Acquisition Sub have irrevocably
agreed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations

 



19  contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that, in light of such Intervening
Event, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Laws; _provided, however,_ that after compliance with clauses
"(C)" through "(E)" of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(ii)_ with respect to any
Intervening Event, the Company shall have no further obligations under clauses
"(C)" through "(E)" of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)(ii)_, and the Company Board
shall not be required to comply with such obligations with respect to any
other Intervening Event.

(e) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish to Acquisition Sub a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of all record and beneficial holders of Company Common Stock and their
addresses, as well as mailing labels containing such names and addresses. The
Company will furnish Acquisition Sub with such additional information
(including any security position listings in the Companys possession) and
assistance as Acquisition Sub may reasonably request for purposes of
communicating the Offer to the holders of Company Common Stock. All
information furnished in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ shall be
held in confidence by Parent and Acquisition Sub in accordance with the
requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall be used by Parent
and Acquisition Sub only in connection with the communication of the Offer to
the holders of Company Common Stock.

any Company Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and each holder
of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled only to receive such consideration as is
determined to be due with respect to such Appraisal Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Appraisal Shares shall not have and shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or shall
otherwise waive, withdraw or lose such holders right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) the right of such holder to be paid such
consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall cease, and (ii) such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into and have become exchangeable only for
the right to receive (upon the surrender of the Company Stock Certificate(s)
or Book Entry Shares previously representing such Appraisal Shares) the Merger
Consideration, without interest and reduced by the amount of any withholding
that is required under applicable Tax Law, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.11_.

(b) The Company (i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demand,
or any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of such demand, by any stockholder
of the Company for appraisal of such stockholders Company Common Stock

appraisal or agree to do any of the foregoing) without the consent of Parent.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Appraisal Shares" shall refer to
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL.

Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 

Section 3.10 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall (in
the name of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company or otherwise) take
such action.

 

Section 3.11 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, after consultation with and providing adequate
written notice to the Company, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, any of the Acquired Companies, any Affiliate thereof or the
Paying Agent (each, a "Withholding Party") shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory Awards such
amount as such Withholding Party is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
a Withholding Party and withheld amounts are paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law, then for
all purposes of this Agreement such amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to the former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.12 _Lost Company Stock Certificates_. If any Company
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Stock Certificate without any interest thereon.

Time. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 6.1_ shall restrict the Acquired Companies from, or require the consent
of Parent prior to, engaging in any transaction or entering into any
agreement exclusively among the Acquired Companies.

 

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company will not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, and will
instruct, and use reasonable best efforts, to cause its representatives not
to:

 

(i) solicit, initiate, endorse or knowingly encourage or facilitate the
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
or any proposals or offers that constitute or would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including by approving any transaction, or
approving any Person becoming an "interested stockholder," for purposes of
Section 203 of the DGCL);

(ii) furnish any information regarding the Company to any Person in
connection with, or in response to, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry;

 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to

Proposal (other than any confidentiality agreement contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_).

 



51 _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company and its representatives may engage in any such
discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent
that: prior to providing any non-public information and/or engaging in any
discussions or negotiations with any Third Party in response to such
Acquisition Proposal, (A) the Company receives from such Third Party (or there
is then in effect with such party) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; and (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. Prior to or concurrent with providing any non-public information to
such Third Party, the Company shall make such non-public information
available to Parent (to the extent such material non-public information has
not been previously made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
representatives).

(b) If the Company or any of its officers, directors, affiliates and
representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, then
the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry)
notify Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
(which notification shall include the material terms and conditions thereof),
and shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed of any material change to
the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

(c) The Company shall, and shall ensure that its
representatives, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party relating
to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; _provided, however_ , that
the foregoing shall not in any way limit or modify any of the Companys
rights under the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Section_ __
_ 2.3(d)_. The Company also agrees that (i) to the extent it has not
previously done so, it will promptly request each Third Party that has
executed a confidentiality agreement since September 1, 2017 in connection
with such Persons consideration of a transaction involving, or the
acquisition of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any portion
thereof) to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person or its representatives by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
release any Third Party from, or terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality or standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, unless the Company Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, and
(iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their
representatives from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder, provided that any such

 



52  disclosure does not contain an express Change in Recommendation; (ii)
disclosing to the Companys stockholders any factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, in each case, only if the Company in good faith determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such information, facts
identity or terms are required to be disclosed under applicable Law (and no
such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be a Change
in Recommendation; _provided_ that such disclosure reaffirms the Company
Boards recommendation of the Offer and does not otherwise amount to a Change
in Recommendation); or (iii) communicating with any Person (or the
representatives of such Person) that makes any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry to the extent necessary to direct such Person to the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_; _provided, however_ , in each of
subclauses (i) through (iii), that the Company Board shall not in connection
with such disclosure make any Change in Recommendation except in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_.

 

(e) Any breach of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ by any of the
Companys directors, officers, affiliates or representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach by the Company.

 

Section 6.3 _Filings; Other Action_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i) promptly
(and (in the case of filings required pursuant to the HSR Act) in no event
later than the date that is five (5) Business Days after the date hereof) use
reasonable best efforts to make and effect all registrations, filings and
submissions required to be made or effected by it or otherwise advisable
pursuant to the HSR Act, other applicable Antitrust Laws, the Exchange Act and
other applicable Laws with respect to the Offer and the Merger; (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required
from Third Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a
timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose
of consummating and effectuating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any Person for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (A) shall promptly provide all information requested by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly take, and cause its Affiliates to take,
all actions and steps necessary to obtain and secure the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws and obtain any clearance or approval required to be
obtained from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of
Justice, any state attorney general, any foreign competition authority or any
other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any applicable Antitrust Law, the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall include: (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, hold separate or other disposition, contemporaneously
with or subsequent to the Effective Time, of any asset or business of the

 



53  Parent or its Subsidiaries or Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) permitting
the Company and its Subsidiaries to sell, divest, license, hold separate or
otherwise dispose any of its or their assets or businesses prior to the
Effective Time; (iii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying, transferring,
assigning, restructuring, or waiving existing agreements, collaborations,
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Parent, Acquisition Sub or Company or their respective
Subsidiaries; and (iv) any other behavioral undertakings and commitments
whatsoever including but not limited to creating or consenting to create any
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations, or other
arrangements of Parent, Acquisition Sub or Company or their respective
Subsidiaries and, in each case, to enter, or offer to enter, into agreements
and stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate
applications with any Governmental Entity in connection with any of the
foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, by consenting to such
action by the Company in any such case of clauses (i)-(iv), so as to obtain
the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Law,
to obtain any required consent or other approval from any Governmental Entity
under any Law, or to prevent the entry of, or have vacated, lifted, reversed
or otherwise overturned, any applicable injunction, judgment or other Order
issued under any Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or
anything else in this Agreement shall require Parent or Acquisition Sub or any
of their Affiliates to take any of the actions described in the preceding
clauses (i)-(iv) if such action would, or would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole; and provided further, that in no event
shall Company proffer, take or agree to take any of the actions described in
the preceding clauses (i)-(iv) without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental
approvals or clearances (including under any Antitrust Law), nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates to sell, divest,
license, hold separate or otherwise dispose any of its or their assets or
businesses, or enter into any license or similar agreement with respect to,
or agree to restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to conduct or
operate in a specified manner, any portion of the business or assets of Parent
or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries after
the Closing), if such action would have more than a minimal adverse effect on
Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section_ __ _
6.3(a)_, subject to applicable Laws, each Party shall: (i) give the other
Parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other Parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or
the Merger. Each Party will consult and cooperate with the other Parties and
will consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with
any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion
or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, each Party
will permit authorized representatives of 

 



54  the other Parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

 

(c) Subject to _Sections 3.8_ , _6.1_ and _6.11_ and the provisos of 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, in the event that any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging
the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding seeks, or
would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall take any and all action to resolve any such
litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to contest any such litigation, action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer or
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.4 _Access_. Upon reasonable advance written notice, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to the Acquired Companies employees, customers, vendors,
partners, properties, books, real properties, records and contracts and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all available
information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that the Acquired Companies shall not be required to
permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company could: (a) result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of Third Parties; (b) violate any obligation of the
Acquired Companies with respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy;
(c) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client
privilege or the attorney work product doctrine; (d) violate any Law (it
being agreed that, with respect to clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d), that the
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to
be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy, contravention
or violation); or (e) materially interfere with the conduct of the Acquired
Companies business. No investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any Party or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available to
Parent. All requests for access pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ must be
directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or another person
designated in writing by the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not, and shall cause their
respective representatives not to, contact any customer or supplier of the
Company in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the Companys prior
consent (such

 



55  consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Parent
and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that any such contact shall be
arranged by and with a representative of the Company participating. All
information obtained by Parent and its representatives pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" of the Acquired
Companies for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5 _Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub_. During the period
from the date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of

Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent,
and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other Parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that (i) a
Party may, without the prior consent of the other Parties, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or
the applicable rules of the NYSE if it has used its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Parties and to obtain such partys consent
but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public
statement is so required to be issued or made, (ii) the Company will not be
obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communication that
are (1) principally directed to employees, customers, partners or vendors so
long as such communications are consistent with previous releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or
individually, if approved the other party), or, (2) subject to _Section_ __ _
6.2_, relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Change in
Recommendation or "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and in
compliance with applicable Laws, Parent and the Company shall develop a joint
plan for communication to the Companys employees, Workers, customers,
suppliers and other strategic Persons about this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and upon development of such plan,
Parent and the Company shall comply with such plan. Prior to making any
written or oral communications to the employees or Workers of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall
have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication,
and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication.

 

Section 6.7 _Other Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
(or, if shorter, during the period of employment), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee of the Acquired
Companies who continues employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") with (i) an
annual base salary or hourly wage rate (as applicable) that

 



56  is at least equal to that provided to the Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash incentive opportunity and
commission opportunity that is at least equal to that provided to the
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) long-term
incentives that are comparable to the long-term incentives provide to
similarly situated employees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and (iv)
other benefits, including, without limitation, employee health, welfare,
retirement and severance benefits (other than defined benefit pension or
retiree medical benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to those provided (A) to similarly situated employees of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or (B) to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whichever is more favorable to the Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide for terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to ensure that,
as of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation
entitlement and severance benefits for service with the Acquired Companies (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past service
credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in which such employees
are eligible to participate; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply (i) with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or
retiree medical benefits or (ii) to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to each health or welfare
benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for the
benefit of Continuing Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause to be waived
any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements
and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan,
and (y) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for
all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company
Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor in accordance with their terms all deferred compensation plans,
agreements and arrangements, severance and separation pay plans, agreements
and arrangements, and all written employment, severance,
retention, incentive, change in control and termination agreements (including
any change in control provisions therein) applicable to employees of the
Acquired Companies and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective
not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time. In
the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval
by Parent).

 



57 (e) The Acquired Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to
satisfy all legal or contractual requirements to provide notice to, or to
carry out any consultation procedure with, any employee or groups of employees
of the Acquired Companies, or any labor or trade union, labor organization,
works council or other employee-representative body, which is representing
any employee of any of the Acquired Companies, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is
intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or
terminating any of its benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a
right in any employee to employment with the Acquired Companies, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights
in any employee of the Company with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any benefit plan which
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation may maintain.

 

Section 6.8 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
compensation committee of the Company Board (the "Compensation Committee")
will cause each Company Benefit Plan and Company employment agreement pursuant
to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is
a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Acceptance Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount substantially similar to those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per
annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof
(the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Acceptance Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered
by such policies with

 



58  coverage for an aggregate period of six years (6) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Acceptance Time,
including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not
exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), for a period of six (6)
years from the Acceptance Time, maintain such policies in full force and
effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Acceptance Time is, or at any time prior to the Acceptance Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each an
"Indemnified Party") for any and all costs and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred;
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay
such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was
not entitled to indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_),
judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action, suit
or other Legal Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such
Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened
(regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a
named party, including as a witness) (an "Indemnified Party Proceeding") (A)
by reason of such Indemnified Partys being or having been such director or
officer or an employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the
request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (B) arising out of
such Indemnified Partys service in connection with any other corporation or
organization for which he or she serves or has served as a director, officer,
employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the Company (including
in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan), in each of (A) or
(B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such position at the
time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at
any time prior to, the Acceptance Time (including any Indemnified Party
Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each
indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the Company
and any Indemnified Party; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on the
date hereof. Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by Indemnified Parties in connection with their
enforcement of their rights provided under this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_. Parents
and the Surviving Corporations obligations under the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation fails to
comply with its obligations in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_ and an
Indemnified Party commences a suit which results in a determination that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation failed to comply with such obligation,

 



59  Parent shall pay such Indemnified Party his or her costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit, together with interest thereon at the "prime rate" as published in
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the
basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding).

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws,
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Party unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to
such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties shall be Third Party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
6.9_). Parent and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree to
pay or advance, upon written request of an Indemnified Party, all costs, fees
and expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in enforcing their indemnity rights and other rights
provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock
(including any Company Options or shares of Company Restricted Stock) by each
Person who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.11 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable notify Parent in writing of any Transaction
Litigation and shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis
regarding any such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to (a) participate in the defense of any Transaction Litigation,
and (b) consult with counsel to the Company regarding the defense, settlement
or compromise with respect to any such Transaction Litigation. For purposes of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept
reasonably apprised on a prompt basis of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not undermined or otherwise adversely affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the
Company shall consider in good faith; _provided_ that the Company shall not
settle or compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction

 



60  Litigation without Parents prior written consent. Without otherwise
limiting the Indemnified Parties rights with regard to the right to counsel,
following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
continue to retain Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel selected by such
Indemnified Parties

 

Section 6.12 _Payoff of Credit Facility_. The Company shall obtain prior
to the Closing a payoff letter (the "Payoff Letter") for the Credit Facility,
which will provide the dollar amount of all Indebtedness required to be paid
under the Credit Facility in order to fully pay off the Credit Facility as of
the Closing and to release all Encumbrances thereunder upon such payment.
Parent shall pay in full at Closing such amount set forth in the Payoff
Letter.

 

Section 6.13 _Tax Receivable Agreement Matters_. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to furnish Parent with information that Parent may
reasonably request relating to the Tax Receivable Agreement and the

61 (c) by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the other at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there shall be any law enacted after

_provided, however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ if the non-satisfaction of

8.1(e)_ unless such written notice otherwise constitutes a Change in
Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ unless

Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall be a condition to the right of the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_;

 



62 (g) by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty
in _Article 4_ or failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in
this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred that would cause
a failure of any of the conditions set forth in clauses "2(d)," "2(e)" and
"2(f)" of _Annex I_ to exist; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, if such a breach is curable by the Company within

failure would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Acquisition Sub from
consummating the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
8.1(h)_, if such a breach is curable by Parent within twenty (20) Business
Days of the date the Company gives Parent written notice of such breach and

breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_
__ _ 8.1(h)_ on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain
uncured upon the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period;
_provided further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ if the
Company is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that Parent
would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _

(i) by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent if Acquisition Sub
fails to consummate the Offer within five (5) Business Days of when required

_Section_ __ _ 8.1(_ _i_ _)_  shall not be available to the Company if the

set forth in this Agreement that has been the cause of, or resulted in,
Acquisition Subs failure to consummate the Offer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of

(a) this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Article 1_ and the applicable definitions
elsewhere in this Agreement, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.4_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Article 9_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) the termination
of this Agreement shall not

 



63  relieve any Party from any liabilities or damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the
bargain lost by such party or such partys equity holders (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the aggregate amount of the Offer
Price, the Merger Consideration, consideration in respect of Company
Compensatory Awards, other combination opportunities and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such party) arising out of its
knowing or intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement delivered in connection herewith or any fraud, subject only, with
respect to any such liabilities of the Company, to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_
and  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that any failure
of Parent or Acquisition Sub to satisfy its obligation to accept for payment
or pay for Company Common Stock or the Company Compensatory Awards when
required pursuant to this Agreement following satisfaction of all of the Offer
Conditions, and any failure of Parent to cause the Merger to be effected
following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ , will be
deemed to constitute an intentional and material breach of a covenant of this
Agreement. The Parties rights and remedies under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring
such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are consummated. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees payable for filings
required or otherwise made pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Laws, and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments
to any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings under the HSR Act
or such other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) If: (i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, (B) following the date hereof and prior to the time
of the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
announced, made or delivered to the Company and (C) the Company consummates
an Acquisition Proposal (with all references to fifteen percent (15%) in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as 50% for purposes of this
clause "(i)") (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal) within twelve
(12) months after such termination or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement within twelve (12) months after such termination to effect an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal); (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_; or
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_, then in the case of each of clauses "(i)" through "(iii)," the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent, in cash at the time specified
in the next sentence, a termination fee in the amount of $31,400,000
(the "Termination Fee"). Any Termination Fee shall be paid: (x) in the case
of clause "(i)" of the preceding sentence of this (b), upon the earlier of
entry into the agreement for, or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, such Acquisition Proposal, (y) in the case of
clause "(ii)" of the preceding sentence of this (b), within two (2) Business
Days following termination of this Agreement and (z) in the case of clause
"(iii)" of the preceding sentence of this (b), concurrently with a termination
of this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_.

 



64 Any Termination Fee due under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be
payable only once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may
be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that Parent
shall receive full payment of the Termination Fee, the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub, any
of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Offer and the Merger (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of
the transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter into this Agreement. In the
event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, Parent
shall be entitled to receive interest on such unpaid Termination Fee,
commencing on the date that the Termination Fee became due, at a rate equal to
the "prime rate" as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition,
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual
number of days elapsed, without compounding) and in the event the Parent or
Acquisition Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee (or portion thereof), the Company shall pay
Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit.

Section 9.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the

 



68  Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power
to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree
to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to
comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Acquisition Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As a material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into
this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Acquisition Sub of
each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed
by Acquisition Sub under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in
this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such
breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance
of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Acquisition Sub
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company
shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and
all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Acquisition Sub
in the first instance. As applicable, references in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_
to "Acquisition Sub" shall also include the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
except as expressly provided in the following sentence. It is accordingly
agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Courts and, in any action for specific performance, each Party
waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement). The Parties
further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 9.11_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ are not
available or otherwise

 



69  are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_
shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Partys
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.11_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ restrict or limit
any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article 8_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available at any time.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 9.12 _Construction_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders.

 

(b) The Parties agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word
"or" is not exclusive.

(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement.

 

(e) All references to a document or instrument having been made available
to Parent shall be deemed to include the making available of such document or
instrument to Parents counsel, to Parents legal or financial advisor or to
any other representative of Parent, including by posting such document in an
electronic data room.

 

(f) All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S.
dollars.

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex_ __ _ I_ and not otherwise defined
herein will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger to which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

(1) Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of the Offer or the
Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall not be obligated to irrevocably accept for
purchase, or, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Acquisition Subs
obligation to purchase or return the tendered Company Common Stock promptly
after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), purchase any Company Common
Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration
Date) pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for), unless (i) there shall have been validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, considered together with all other shares of
Company Common Stock (if any) beneficially owned by Parent and its controlled
Affiliates (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been received), represent one
more than 50% of the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer, plus (y) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then issuable to holders of
Company Options from which the Company has received notices of exercise prior
to the expiration of the Offer (and as to which such shares have not yet been
issued to such exercising holders of Company Options) (such condition, the
"Minimum Condition") and (ii) the waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act
or other applicable Antitrust Laws shall have expired or been terminated.

(2) In addition and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, Acquisition
Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Acquisition Sub to, irrevocably accept for purchase or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to Acquisition Subs obligation to pay for or return
tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), purchase any shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date) pursuant to
the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for purchase) if at any time on or
after the date of the commencement of the Offer and prior to the Expiration
Date, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing at the
Expiration Date:

 

(a) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

 

(b) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law that is in effect and
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits, or issued a final and nonappealable
Order, or taken any other action, that is in effect and permanently restrains,
enjoins or otherwise prohibits, in each case, the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



A-1 (c) (i) other than representations set forth in clauses (ii), (iii)
and (iv) below, the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in the Agreement shall not have been true and correct (in each case,
disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or similar standard or
qualification) as of the date of the Agreement or as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty shall not have been true and
correct as of such earlier date), except where the failure of any such
representation or warranty to be so true and correct would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) the representation and warranty of the Company set forth
in clause (b) of the first sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ (Absence of
Certain Changes) shall not have been true and correct of the date of the
Agreement or as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
and time (except to the extent that such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such earlier date); (iii)
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 4.3(a)_ (Capitalization) and _Section_ __ _ 4.17_ (Authority; Binding
Nature of Agreement) shall not have been true and correct as of the date of
the Agreement or as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such
date and time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such earlier date),
except for _de_ _minimis_ inaccuracies; and (iv) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (Due Organization and Good
Standing) and _Section_ __ _ 4.22_ (Brokers) shall not have been true and
correct (in each case, disregarding all qualifications and exceptions
contained therein regarding materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or
similar standard or qualification) in all material respects as of the date of
the Agreement or as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such
date and time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall not have been true and correct in all material respects as of
such earlier date);

(d) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material
respects with the obligations or covenants required to be performed by it
under the Agreement and such failure to perform or comply shall not have been
cured prior to the Expiration Date;

 

(e) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent, dated as of the
Expiration Date, a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior
executive officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth
in the foregoing clauses (2)(c) and (2)(d) have been satisfied as of
immediately prior to the Expiration Date; or

 

(f) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred and be
continuing any event, change, effect, occurrence, circumstance or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



A-2 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Sub and may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and
Acquisition Sub; _provided_ that the Minimum Condition may be waived by Parent
and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company, which
may be granted or withheld in the Companys sole discretion, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.
