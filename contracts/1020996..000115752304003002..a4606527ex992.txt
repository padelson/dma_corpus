or Article  10 which are for the benefit of any other Party.  (2) The
Purchasers shall keep the Shareholders informed as to the status of the 
proceedings related to the application, notification and filings, relating

otherwise, including management\'s  discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations  (the "Company Information"), provided
that neither the Shareholders nor the  Company shall incur any out of pocket
expense (other than in respect of  which they shall have been reimbursed) in

unreasonably withheld. For  greater certainty, if no comments or objections
are received from the  Reviewers by the end of such two Business Day period,
then the Reviewers  shall be deemed to have consented to the disclosure. In
addition, the  Shareholders and the Company shall instruct the Auditors and
use  commercially reasonable efforts to otherwise cause the Auditors to

requisite consents required to enable the Purchaser to fulfill any 
requirements imposed on it by the United States Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   Section 10.4

timely make or prepare all Tax  Returns required to be made or prepared by
them and to duly and timely file  all Tax Returns required to be filed by
them for periods (each, a  "Continuing Period") beginning before and ending
after the Share Purchase  Closing Time. If income taxes would be payable by a
Filing Entity for a  Stub Period or a Continuing Period in the absence of the
Filing Entity  claiming the maximum amount of any discretionary deductions
available to  it, the Tax Return of the Filing Entity for that Stub Period or
Continuing  Period, as the case may be, shall be prepared on the basis that
the Filing  Entity will claim such portion of the maximum amount of any
discretionary  deductions available to it for that Stub Period or Continuing
Period, as  the case may be, that would result in either the least amount of
income  taxes or in no income taxes being payable by the Filing Entity for
that  Stub Period or Continuing Period, as the case may be.  (2) The
Shareholders, on the one hand, and the Share Purchaser, on the other  hand,
shall cooperate fully with each other and make available to each  other in a
timely fashion such data and other information as may reasonably  be required
for the preparation of any Tax Return of the applicable Filing  Entity for a
Stub Period or Continuing Period and shall preserve such data  and other
information until the expiration of any applicable limitation  period under
any applicable Law with respect to Taxes.  (3) Tax Returns required to be
prepared by the Share Purchaser for Stub Periods  or Continuing Periods shall
be submitted in draft form to the Shareholders  (in respect of the Company),
at least 30 days before the date on which such  Tax Returns are required by
Law to be filed with the relevant Governmental  Authority. The Shareholders
shall, subject to Law, have the right to  require the Share Purchaser to
cause reasonable changes to be made to any  such Tax Return by communicating
such changes in writing to the Share  Purchaser at least 15 days before the
date on which such Tax Return is  required by Law to be filed with the
relevant Governmental Authority. The  Share Purchaser shall make, or cause to
be made, such changes required by  the Shareholders and file only such Tax

receives an assessment, a reassessment, an indication in writing that an
assessment or reassessment is being considered or proposed or any other

Agreement, will (i) make, or cause to be made, all such filings

reasonably, considers highly confidential and sensitive which may be filed on
a confidential basis), and all notices and correspondence received from any
Governmental Authority.  Section 10.10 Risk of Loss.  If the assets of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, are damaged or destroyed or appropriated,

be, in which event to  the extent that the representations and warranties of
the Shareholders are  not true and correct in all material respects as of the
Closing Date solely  as a result of such damage, destruction, expropriation

shall be deemed to be true and correct in  all material respects as of the
Closing Date for all purposes under this  Agreement and all proceeds of any
insurance or compensation for  expropriation or seizure in respect thereof
will be payable to the  Purchasers, and all right and claim of the

which  indemnification is sought, the Party or Parties seeking
indemnification (in  this Section, the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt
notice, and in any  event within 20 days, to the Party from whom
indemnification is being  sought (in this Section, the "Indemnifying Party")
of any such Claims made  upon it. If the Indemnified Party fails to give such
notice, such failure  shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from obtaining
such  indemnification but the Indemnified Party\'s right to indemnification
may be  reduced to the extent that such delay prejudiced the defence of the
Claim  or increased the amount of liability or cost of defence and provided
that  no claim for indemnity in respect of the breach of any representation
or  warranty contained in this Agreement may be made unless notice of such 
Claim has been given prior to the expiry of the survival period applicable 
to such representation and warranty pursuant to Article 7.  (2) The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by notice to the Indemnified  Party
given not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice described in 
Section 11.2(1), to assume the control of the defence, compromise or 
settlement of the Claim, provided that (i) such assumption shall, by its 
terms, be without cost to the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying 
Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified 
Party in accordance with the terms contained in this Section in respect of 
that Claim.; and (iii) where the Claim is in respect of or relating to 
Taxes, the Indemnifying Party\'s right to so contest shall only apply after 
the Indemnifying Party has paid such Taxes to the Governmental Authority or 
has otherwise provided security for the payment of such Taxes in a manner 
that is satisfactory to the Indemnified Party acting reasonably.  (3) Upon
the assumption of control of any Claim by the Indemnifying Party as  set out
in Section 11.2(1), the Indemnifying Party shall diligently proceed  with the
defence, compromise or settlement of the Claim at its sole  expense,
including if necessary, employment of counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and, in connection therewith, the  Indemnified Party shall
cooperate fully, but at the expense of the  Indemnifying Party with respect
to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred, to  make available to the
Indemnifying Party all pertinent information and  witnesses under the
Indemnified Party\'s control, make such assignments and  take such other
steps as in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnifying  Party are reasonably
necessary to enable the Indemnifying Party to conduct  such defence. The
Indemnified Party shall also have the right to  participate in the
negotiation, settlement or defence of any Claim at its  own expense.    
-77-  (4) The final determination of any Claim pursuant to this Section
11.2,  including all related costs and expenses, shall be binding and
conclusive  upon the Parties as to the validity or invalidity, as the case
may be of  such Claim against the Indemnifying Party.  (5) If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume control of a Claim as permitted  in
Section 11.2(1), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make such 
settlement of the Claim as in its sole discretion may appear advisable, and 
such settlement or any other final determination of the Claim shall be 
binding upon the Indemnifying Party.  (6) If there is more than one
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Parties  which face the greatest share
of any liability for indemnification in  connection with the Claim shall be
entitled to act on behalf of the  remaining Indemnifying Parties and all
Indemnifying Parties in respect of  such Claim agree to be bound by their
actions in connection therewith.  Section 11.3 Share Purchase Price and
Purchase for Cancellation Price  Adjustment.  For greater certainty, the
Shareholders and Purchasers agree that the Share Vendors\' Proportionate
Share of any payment made pursuant to this Article 11 shall constitute and
shall be treated by such parties as an adjustment to the Share Purchase Price
payable by Purchaser hereunder in respect of the Purchased Shares and that
the Purchase for Cancellation Shareholders\' Proportionate Share of any
payment made pursuant to this Article 11 shall constitute and be treated by
such parties as an adjustment to the Purchase for Cancellation Price
payable by the Company pursuant to the Purchase for Cancellation contemplated
hereby.  Section 11.4 Mitigation and Exclusive Remedies.  Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall affect the obligation of a Party seeking
indemnification to take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its losses.
The provisions of this Article 11 shall apply to any Claim for breach of
covenant, representation, warranty or other provision of this Agreement

provisions of this Section.  Section 12.4 Assignment.  The Purchaser shall
be entitled, upon giving written notice to the Shareholders at any time not
less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Time, to assign some or all
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the
Purchaser. To the extent of such assignment, such assignee shall have and may
exercise all the rights of the Purchaser under this Agreement. Such
assignment shall be on the basis that no assignment shall release the
Purchaser from liability for its obligations as Purchaser under
this Agreement and the Purchaser shall be and remain jointly and severally
liable with the assignee for all of the obligations of the Purchaser
hereunder. In the event of such an assignment, the Shareholders, the Company
and such assignee shall execute an agreement confirming such assignment and
the assumption of obligations contemplated in this Section and, upon
execution and delivery of such agreement to the Shareholders and the Company,
any reference to the Purchaser in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to
such assignee, to the extent of such assignment. Except as hereinbefore
provided, neither this Agreement nor any benefits or burdens under this
Agreement shall be assignable by any Party without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall enure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective
successors (including any successor by reason of amalgamation of any Party)
and permitted assigns.  Section 12.5 Amendment.  No amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver or termination of this Agreement and, unless otherwise
specified, no consent or approval by any Party, shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the Party to be bound thereby.  Section 12.6 Further
Assurances.  The Parties shall, with reasonable diligence, do all such things
and provide all such reasonable assurances as may be required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall provide
such further documents or instruments required by any other Party as may
be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the purpose of this Agreement
and carry out its provisions, whether before or after the Closings provided
that the costs and expenses of any actions taken after the Closings at the
request of a Party shall be the responsibility of the requesting Party. For
greater certainty, the Purchaser shall cause the Share Purchaser to comply
with all of its obligations under this Agreement.     -81-  Section
12.7 Execution and Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by the
Parties in counterparts and may be executed and delivered by facsimile and
all such counterparts and facsimiles shall together constitute one and the
same agreement.  Section 12.8 Disclosure on Schedules.  The Parties agree
that disclosure of a fact or matter by the Purchaser or the Shareholders in
any Schedule attached hereto shall be sufficient disclosure for purposes of
all other Schedules attached hereto.  Section 12.9 Independent Legal
Advice.  Each Shareholder acknowledges that he or it has been advised to
obtain, and that he or it has obtained or has been afforded the opportunity
to obtain, independent legal advice with respect to this Agreement and
understands the nature and consequences of this Agreement, including without
limitation any tax consequences.  Section 12.10 Release of Shareholder
Claims.  Effective as of the Share Purchase Closing Time, each
Shareholder hereby remises, releases and forever discharges the Company and
its employees, officers, directors and shareholders from any and all actions,
causes of action, suits, covenants, contracts, claims and demands whatsoever,
whether contingent or otherwise, which as at the Share Purchase Closing Time
he or it had, has or thereafter can, shall or may have solely in his or its
capacity as a shareholder of the Company.  Section 12.11 Withholding. 
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement but, for greater certainty,
subject to Section 3.16, the Purchasers and the Company are entitled to
withhold from any payment required to be made hereunder any and all Taxes
or other amounts required to be withheld by any Law and the Purchaser,
Share Purchaser and the Company, as the case may be, agree to remit such
withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority within the time
required by Law.      -82-   IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Parties have
