STOCK AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

This STOCK AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made this 16th
day of April, 2014 by and between (i) Chemtura Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Chemtura"; Chemtura and each of the entities listed on Schedule
A, a "Seller" and collectively, "Sellers"), and (ii) Platform Specialty
Products Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") (on its own behalf
and as agent on behalf of certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries to be
formed prior to the Closing (as defined herein)).

  

  

WHEREAS, Chemtura desires to sell and cause the other Sellers to sell, and
Purchaser desires to purchase, Sellers' "Chemtura AgroSolutions" business,
consisting of the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of seed
treatments, fungicides, miticides, insecticides, growth regulators and
herbicides (but excluding fumigant products sold by Sellers' Great Lakes
Solutions business, including fumigant products based on methyl bromide and/or
chloropicrin and the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of any
materials for use in battery applications) (the "Business");

  

  

WHEREAS, Sellers currently conduct the Business directly and indirectly
through the entities listed on Schedule B (the "Transferred Entities" and each
a "Transferred Entity"); and

  

  

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this
Agreement, Purchaser desires to acquire from Sellers certain assets (including
certain equity interests) used in the conduct of the Business, and to assume
certain Liabilities (as defined below) relating to the Business, and Sellers
desire to transfer such assets and Liabilities to Purchaser, in each case as
more particularly set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and
agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS;

  

ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

  

  

Section 1.1. Purchase and Sale.

  

  

(a) General. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and, pursuant to the International Asset Purchase Agreements or the
International Stock Purchase Agreements (in any jurisdiction where such
agreements are required by applicable Law or deemed necessary or advisable by
the parties), at the Closing, Chemtura shall, and shall cause the other
Sellers to, sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from Sellers, all of Sellers'
right, title and interest in and to (i) the Equity Interests of the
Transferred Entities, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and (ii) the
Transferred Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances), in exchange for (A) a cash payment equal to the Estimated Cash
Consideration, payable and subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 1.8,
(B) 2,000,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (the "Purchaser Common Stock"), free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable securities Laws,
rules and regulations) (the "Stock Consideration") and (C) Purchaser's
assumption (including, where applicable, through a Country-Specific Purchaser)
of the Assumed Liabilities and its agreement to cause all Assumed Liabilities
to be paid, performed and discharged when due, without recourse to Sellers or
their respective Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities or to the
extent set forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Country-Specific Purchasers. Promptly following the date hereof and in any
event prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate, as applicable, the acquisition of the International
Transferred Assets and the assumption of the International Assumed Liabilities
or the acquisition of the International Transferred Shares, on the Closing
Date in accordance with this Agreement, including the formation of new
Subsidiaries in each jurisdiction where a local Subsidiary is necessary (or
desirable in the sole discretion of Purchaser) to acquire International
Transferred Assets and assume International Assumed Liabilities, or acquire
the International Transferred Shares, and in which Purchaser does not have
(or, where not necessary, does not desire to use in its sole discretion) an
existing local Subsidiary capable of acquiring such International Transferred
Assets or the International Transferred Shares or assuming International
Assumed Liabilities (such new Subsidiaries and existing Subsidiaries as
acquire any International Transferred Assets or International Transferred
Shares, the "Country-Specific Purchasers"). Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that, prior to Closing, each of the Country-
Specific Purchasers (i) has a bank account, (ii) is fully licensed and
qualified and authorized to acquire the applicable International Transferred
Assets and assume the applicable International Assumed Liabilities, or acquire
the International Transferred Shares, as the case may be, (iii) has one or
more officers who have been duly authorized to execute on behalf of such
Country-Specific Purchaser the applicable International Asset Purchase
Agreement and/or International Stock Purchase Agreement and any other
documents required in connection therewith, and (iv) has obtained all required
licenses, approvals and registrations related to Taxes. Purchaser acknowledges
that its failure to complete any of the actions contemplated by this Section
1.1(b), including the formation of any Country-Specific Purchaser, shall not
relieve Purchaser of its obligation to close when required by Section 2.1.
Promptly following the date hereof, Purchaser and Sellers shall comply with
and perform all of their respective obligations set forth in Section 1.1(b) of
the Disclosure Schedules that each is required to comply with and perform
prior to the Closing. Any agreements to be entered into as contemplated by
Section 1.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedules shall be on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Chemtura and Purchaser.

  

  

(c) Restructuring Transactions. Prior to the Closing, Chemtura shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the actions and transactions
described in Section 1.1(c) of the Disclosure Schedules ("Post-Signing
Restructuring Transactions") to be implemented as set forth therein, subject
to such changes or modifications as Chemtura deems necessary, appropriate or
desirable; provided that Chemtura shall not make any such changes or
modifications that may adversely affect the Transferred Assets, Transferred
Entities, the Business or Purchaser (economic or otherwise), whether before or
after Closing, without Purchaser's prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(xiii) all prepaid expenses and deposits to the extent primarily relating to

used by Sellers or their Affiliates solely in connection with the provision of

Section 1.3. Consent to Assignment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or convey any
Transferred Asset or any claim, right or benefit thereunder or arising
therefrom, if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance of such
Transferred Asset or such claim, right or benefit thereunder or arising
therefrom (collectively, the "Interests") would constitute a breach or a
violation of any applicable Law, or would in any way adversely affect the
rights of Purchaser or any Seller thereunder, or if such Interest is not
capable of being sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed without any third
party consent which has not been obtained by (or does not remain in full force
and effect at) the Closing, unless and until (i) such Interest (a "Excluded
Interest") can be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed in accordance with
Section 1.2(a) without such a breach, violation of Law or adverse effect on
Purchaser or any Seller's rights thereunder or (ii) such third party consent
is obtained, at which time, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), such Excluded
Interest shall be deemed to be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed in
accordance with Section 1.2(a) and shall cease to be a Excluded Interest.

  

  

(b) Sellers and Chemtura shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all consents required to assign any Interests to Purchaser. To the extent that
any Interest cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed without a
breach or violation of any applicable Law or any adverse effect on the rights
of Purchaser or any Seller thereunder, or to the extent any Interest cannot be
sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed without any third party consent which
has not been obtained by (or which does not remain in full force and effect
at) the Closing, (i) the parties shall, while such Interest remains an
Excluded Interest, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in
any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide the benefits of
such Excluded Interest to Purchaser, and (ii) Purchaser shall promptly pay or
satisfy the corresponding liabilities and obligations (including annual state
maintenance fees for Product Registrations) for such period of time as
Purchaser receives such benefits (or to the extent such liabilities and
obligations are otherwise attributable to Purchaser's receipt of such
benefits), to the extent Purchaser would have been responsible therefor if
there had been no such breach or violation of Law, adverse effect or required
third party consent, and as if such Excluded Interest had been transferred to
Purchaser as of the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Chemtura nor any Seller shall have any obligation to seek
any third party consent or to cooperate in providing the benefits of any
Excluded Interest to Purchaser, in either case, following the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date. The failure of any third party consent to be
obtained or the failure of any Interest to constitute a Transferred Asset or
any circumstances resulting therefrom shall not, in and of itself, constitute
a Business Material Adverse Effect or a breach by Chemtura of any
representation, warranty, condition, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) In furtherance of the parties' obligations contained in Section 1.3(b),
each of Chemtura and Purchaser shall comply with and perform all of their
respective obligations set forth in Section 1.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedules
in all material respects in accordance with the timeframes set forth therein.
Subject to the following sentence, Chemtura shall between the date hereof and
the Closing cause the employees that regularly coordinate and manage the
technical aspects of obtaining consents from third parties or Governmental
Authorities necessary in connection with the assignment or transfer (or re-
registration in jurisdictions where assignment or transfer is not permitted)
of any Product Registrations for the Business to use reasonable efforts to
prepare the appropriate documentation necessary for the assignment or transfer
of all such Product Registrations to Purchaser for filing by Purchaser
promptly following the Closing; provided that the foregoing shall be
subordinate in priority to, and shall not require any action that would hinder
or delay, the actions required to cause the closing condition set forth in
Section 6.2(h) to be satisfied. Purchaser shall provide Chemtura and its
employees with such information and assistance as shall be reasonably
requested by Chemtura in connection with the preparation of such
documentation. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that after Closing, Chemtura
will not have the employees or assets necessary for managing the technical
aspects of obtaining consents from third parties or Governmental Authorities
necessary in connection with the assignment or transfer (or re-registration in
jurisdictions where assignment or transfer is not permitted) of any Product
Registration to (or in the name of) Purchaser as such employees and assets are
being transferred to Purchaser hereunder. Chemtura hereby consents to, and
waives any conflict arising out of Purchaser's retention of Eversheds LLP and
Keller Heckman to assist Purchaser in connection with assignment or transfer
of the Product Registrations to Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby consents to,
and waives any conflict arising out of Chemtura's retention of Eversheds LLP
and Keller Heckman to assist Chemtura in connection with any matter after the
Closing; provided that, in each case, such consents and waivers shall not
apply to any litigation matters.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Promptly following the date hereof and in any event prior to the Closing,
Chemtura shall, at its sole cost and expense (except with respect to any Data
Call-in Costs required in connection with such transfers, which shall be borne
equally by Chemtura and Purchaser), (i) take such actions as are necessary to
form a new U.S. Subsidiary (the "U.S. Product Registration Transferred
Entity"), (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the U.S.
Product Registrations to the U.S. Product Registrations Transferred Entity,
and, (iii) upon the completion of the transfer of each of the U.S. Product
Registrations, prepare and file the appropriate documentation necessary for
the transfer of the state level Product Registrations associated with such
U.S. Product Registrations to the U.S. Product Registrations Transferred
Entity. Prior to formation, Chemtura agrees to reasonably consult with
Purchaser regarding the entity type, entity name and capitalization structure
of the U.S. Product Registration Transferred Entity. Upon formation, the U.S.
Product Registration Transferred Entity shall be deemed a Transferred Entity
for purposes of this Agreement, including with respect to the representations
and warranties of Chemtura set forth in Article III.

  

  

(e) Promptly following the date hereof and in any event prior to the Closing,
Chemtura shall, at its sole cost and expense (except with respect to any Data
Call-in Costs required in connection with such transfers, which shall be borne
equally by Chemtura and Purchaser), (i) take such actions as are necessary to
form a new Canadian Subsidiary (the "Canadian Product Registration Transferred
Entity"), (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the Canadian
Product Registrations to the Canadian Product Registrations Transferred
Entity, and (iii) upon the completion of the transfer of each of the Canadian
Product Registrations, prepare and file the appropriate documentation
necessary for the transfer of the Canadian province level Product
Registrations (if any) associated with such Canadian Product Registrations to
the Canadian Product Registrations Transferred Entity. Prior to formation,
Chemtura agrees to reasonably consult with Purchaser regarding the entity
type, entity name and capitalization structure of the Canadian Product
Registration Transferred Entity. Upon formation, the Canadian Product
Registration Transferred Entity shall be deemed a Transferred Entity for
purposes of this Agreement, including with respect to the representations and
warranties of Chemtura set forth in Article III.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Each of Chemtura and Purchaser shall bear its own fees and expenses in
connection with seeking consents from third parties or Governmental
Authorities that are necessary to assign or otherwise transfer to Purchaser
any Transferred Asset, except that all costs, fees and expenses paid (whether
before, on or after Closing) to any third party or any Governmental Authority
to obtain any such consent (including costs paid to obtain consent to transfer
to Purchaser the right to use data on which any Product Registration
transferred to Purchaser relies) shall be shared equally by Chemtura and
Purchaser; provided that Chemtura and Purchaser agree to cooperate with each
other to seek to minimize the amount of such costs, fees and expenses to the
extent practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Governmental
Authority requires a "data call-in" (or similar request for additional data in
support of the Product Registration) as a condition to consenting to the
assignment or transfer (or re-registration in jurisdictions where assignment
or transfer is not permitted) of any Product Registration to (or in the name
of) Purchaser, the costs, fees and expenses attributable to such "data call-
in" (or similar request for additional data in support of a Product
Registration) ("Data Call-in Costs") shall be borne by Purchaser, except in
the event of any such "data call-in" (or similar request for additional data
in support of a Product Registration) made prior to the Closing, in which case
such Data Call-in Costs shall be borne equally by Chemtura and Purchaser.

(a) Assumed Liabilities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall (including, where applicable,

Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) to the extent relating to or

9  

  

 

 

 

  

(vii) all Liabilities relating to the Transferred U.S. Employees and the

after the Closing Date;

  

  

(xi) subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(a), all Liabilities arising out
of or relating to the Business arising under Environmental Laws (except to the
extent such Liabilities are deemed Excluded Liabilities under Section
1.4(b)(ii)).

  

  

(b) Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.4(a),
Purchaser shall not assume any Liabilities of the Business or the Sellers
other than Assumed Liabilities (the "Excluded Liabilities"). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Excluded Liabilities shall include the
following:

  

  

(i) all Liabilities (other than Liabilities of the Transferred Entities)
relating to Taxes for which Chemtura is required to provide indemnification to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.14(a);

  

  

(ii) all Liabilities, including Liabilities arising under Environmental Laws,

10  

  

 

 

 

  

(vi) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.9, any Liabilities arising in
connection with or relating to (A) any U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit

agreement or Multiemployer Plan.

  

  

(c) Liabilities of the Transferred Entities. The parties agree that none of
the Liabilities of the Transferred Entities shall be assumed by Purchaser

that, any Excluded Liabilities held by any Transferred Entity shall be assumed
by a Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than any other Transferred Entity)
immediately prior to Closing.

  

  

Section 1.5. Payment of Aggregate Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, at Closing, Purchaser shall (A) pay or cause to be paid to
Chemtura, as agent for all Sellers, an amount in cash equal to (a)
$950,000,000, plus (b) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if
such amount is positive), minus (c) the absolute value of the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if such amount is negative), plus (d) the
Estimated Retained Cash, minus (e) the absolute value of the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness (if any) (the sum of the foregoing clauses (a) through (d), the

funds to the account designated by the Company and (B) issue to Chemtura the
Stock Consideration. In addition, at Closing Purchaser shall, on behalf of the
Sellers, pay the Closing Indebtedness by wire transfer in accordance with
payoff letters relating thereto. The Estimated Cash Consideration shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.8.

  

  

Section 1.6. Pre-Closing Estimated Adjustment of Cash Consideration. No later
than five Business Days prior to Closing, Chemtura shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser (a) a statement setting forth the Pre-Closing Working Capital and
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount, which statement shall be
prepared in good faith and contain a reasonable summary of the calculation of
such amounts, (b) a statement setting forth an estimated calculation of
Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), which statement
shall be prepared in good faith and contain a reasonable summary of the
calculation of such amount, and (c) a statement setting forth an estimated
calculation of the Retained Cash, which statement shall be prepared in good
faith and contain a reasonable summary of the calculation of such amount
("Estimated Retained Cash" and such statements, collectively, the "Estimate").
The Pre-Closing Working Capital, the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
Amount, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the Estimated Retained Cash shall
be set forth in U.S. dollars after any applicable portion thereof denominated
in a currency other than U.S. dollars has been converted to U.S. dollars at
the foreign exchange reference rate with respect to such currency published in
the Wall Street Journal on the date that the Estimate is delivered pursuant to
this Section 1.6. Purchaser shall be permitted to review the Estimate and, to
the extent it disagrees with any calculations set forth therein, Purchaser and
Chemtura shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement prior
to Closing; provided, however, that if the parties are not able to resolve any
such disagreements the parties shall close using the Estimate as delivered by
Chemtura to Purchaser. The Estimate shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
subject to the Calculation Principles set forth on Schedule C (the
"Calculation Principles").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 1.7. Closing Adjustments Schedule.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 90 days, after the Closing
Date, Chemtura will prepare and deliver to Purchaser a schedule setting forth
Chemtura's calculation of Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness,
if any, and the Retained Cash, if any (the "Closing Adjustments Schedule"). In
connection with Chemtura's preparation of the Closing Adjustments Schedule,
Purchaser shall be permitted to make available to Chemtura any documentation
or data that Purchaser deems reasonably relevant to the preparation thereof,
and Purchaser shall cooperate in providing such information as Chemtura may
reasonably request from Purchaser to assist Chemtura with the preparation
thereof. The Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness, the
Final Retained Cash and the Final Cash Consideration Adjustment set forth in
Section 1.8, if any, shall be set forth in U.S. dollars after any applicable
portion thereof denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars has been
converted to U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange reference rate with respect
to such currency published in the Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date. The
Closing Adjustments Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
subject to the Calculation Principles.

  

  

(b) If Purchaser disagrees with Chemtura's calculation of Closing Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness or Retained Cash delivered pursuant to Section
1.7(a), Purchaser may, within 90 days after delivery of the documents referred
to in Section 1.7(a), deliver a notice to Chemtura disagreeing with any such
calculation and setting forth Purchaser's calculation of the applicable
amounts and, in reasonable detail, Purchaser's grounds for such disagreement.
Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to
which Purchaser disagrees, and Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with
all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Adjustments Schedule and
the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or the
Retained Cash, as applicable, delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(a).

  

  

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(a),
Purchaser and Chemtura shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of (i)
Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be more than the amount
thereof shown in Chemtura's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(a)
nor less than the amount thereof shown in Purchaser's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 1.7(b), (ii) Closing Indebtedness, which amount shall not
be more than the amount thereof shown in Chemtura's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 1.7(a) nor less than the amount thereof shown in
Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(b) and (iii) the
Retained Cash, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in
Chemtura's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(a) nor less than the
amount thereof shown in Purchaser's calculation delivered pursuant to Section
1.7(b). If, during such period, Purchaser and Chemtura are unable to reach
such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Grant Thornton or another
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing acceptable to
Purchaser and Chemtura (the "Accountant"), promptly to review this Agreement
and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or the Retained Cash, as applicable.
In making such calculation(s), the Accountant shall consider only those items
or amounts in the Closing Adjustments Schedule or Chemtura's calculation of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or the Retained Cash, as
applicable, as to which Purchaser has disagreed. Purchaser and Chemtura shall
be permitted to make available to the Accountant a supporting schedule and
analysis with respect to its calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and/or the Retained Cash (and shall provide any such supporting
documentation as the Accountant may reasonably request). The Accountant shall
deliver to Purchaser and Chemtura, as promptly as practicable, a report
setting forth its calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
and/or the Retained Cash, as applicable. Such report shall be final and
binding upon Purchaser and Chemtura. The party (either Purchaser, on the one
hand, or Chemtura, on the other hand) whose calculation of the disputed items
and amounts of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and/or the
Retained Cash, as applicable (the "Disputed Calculation"), is closer in amount
to the Disputed Calculation as finally determined by the Accountant in
accordance with this Section 1.7(c) (the "Objection Dispute Prevailing Party")
shall pay a percentage of the fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant (as
well as the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of outside counsel and
consultants engaged by the parties in connection with the dispute) calculated
by dividing (x) the amount of the difference between the Objection Dispute
Prevailing Party's calculation of Disputed Calculation and the Disputed
Calculation as finally determined by the Accountant, by (y) the amount of the
difference between the Objection Dispute Prevailing Party's calculation of
Disputed Calculation and the non-Objection Dispute Prevailing Party's
calculation of the Disputed Calculation. The non-Objection Dispute Prevailing
Party shall pay the remainder of the fees, costs and expenses of the
Accountant (as well as the remainder of such reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of outside counsel and consultants engaged by the parties in
connection with the dispute). For example, if Chemtura claims that the
Disputed Calculation is $1,000 greater than the Disputed Calculation as
determined by Purchaser and if the Accountant ultimately resolves the
Objections Dispute by awarding to Chemtura $300 of the $1,000 contested, then
the fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant (as well as the reasonable out-
of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of outside counsel and consultants engaged
by the parties in connection with the dispute) will be allocated 30% (i.e.,
300 ÷ 1,000) to Purchaser and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to Chemtura.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Purchaser and Chemtura agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and the Transferred Entities and the
personnel of the Business to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Adjustments Schedule and the calculation of Closing Working Capital
and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section,
including the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work
papers and personnel.

  

  

Section 1.8. Post-Closing Adjustment of Cash Consideration.

  

  

(a) Following the determination of Final Closing Working Capital, Final
Closing Indebtedness and the Final Retained Cash, a payment shall be made by
Chemtura, on behalf of all Sellers, to Purchaser, or by Purchaser to Chemtura,
on behalf of all Sellers, as applicable, as an adjustment to the Estimated
Cash Consideration and shall be paid in the manner and with interest as
provided in Section 1.8(b) (the "Final Cash Consideration Adjustment"), in
accordance with the following:

  

  

(i) if (A) Base Closing Working Capital exceeds Final Closing Working Capital
(such excess, the "Base Closing Working Capital Excess"), (B) the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount was negative, and (C) the absolute value of
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount was less than the Base Closing
Working Capital Excess, then Chemtura shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to the Base Closing Working Capital Excess minus the absolute value of the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) if (A) Base Closing Working Capital exceeds Final Closing Working
Capital, (B) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount was negative, and
(C) the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount was
greater than the Base Closing Working Capital Excess, then Purchaser shall pay
to Chemtura an amount equal to the absolute value of the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment Amount minus the Base Closing Working Capital Excess;

  

  

(iii) if (A) Base Closing Working Capital exceeds Final Closing Working
Capital, and (B) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount was positive,
then Chemtura shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount plus the Base Closing Working
Capital Excess;

  

  

(iv) if (A) Final Closing Working Capital exceeds Base Closing Working Capital
(such excess, the "Final Closing Working Capital Excess"), (B) the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount was positive, and (C) the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment Amount was less than the Final Closing Working Capital
Excess, then Purchaser shall pay to Chemtura an amount equal to the Final
Closing Working Capital Excess minus the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
Amount;

  

  

(v) if (A) Final Closing Working Capital exceeds Base Closing Working Capital
and Pre-Closing Working Capital and (B) the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Amount was negative, then Purchaser shall pay to Chemtura an amount
equal to the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount
plus the Final Closing Working Capital Excess;

  

  

(vi) if (A) Final Closing Working Capital exceeds Base Closing Working
Capital, (B) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount was positive, and
(C) the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount was greater than the Final
Closing Working Capital Excess, Chemtura shall pay to Purchaser an amount
equal to the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount minus the Final
Closing Working Capital Excess;

  

  

(vii) if Final Closing Indebtedness exceeds Estimated Closing Indebtedness,
Chemtura shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such excess;

  

  

(viii) if Final Closing Indebtedness is less than Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, Chemtura shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such
difference.

  

  

(ix) if Final Retained Cash exceeds Estimated Retained Cash, Purchaser shall
pay to Chemtura, as agent for all Sellers, an amount equal to such excess; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

(x) if Final Retained Cash is less than the Estimated Retained Cash, Chemtura
shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such difference.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (A) Purchaser and
Chemtura, on behalf of the Sellers, agree that the Final Cash Consideration
Adjustment shall be settled in U.S. dollars, and (B) any payments due and
owing pursuant to Section 1.8(a) shall be paid within ten days following the
determination of Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and
Final Retained Cash and (C) any amounts due and owing pursuant to Sections
1.8(a)(i) through 1.8(a)(viii) may be set off against each other to the extent
applicable such that one payment is due thereunder.

  

  

"Final Closing Working Capital", "Final Closing Indebtedness" and "Final
Retained Cash" mean Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and the
Retained Cash, respectively, as shown in Chemtura's calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 1.7(a), if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto
is duly delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(a); or if such a notice of
disagreement is delivered, as agreed by Purchaser and Chemtura, on behalf of
Sellers, pursuant to Section 1.7(c) or in the absence of such agreement, as
shown in the Accountant's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 1.7(c).

  

  

(b) Method of Payment, Interest, etc. Any payments pursuant to Section 1.8(a)
shall be made in U.S. dollars in accordance with the currency conversion set
forth in Section 1.7(a) and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the receiving party
within ten days after Final Closing Working Capital has been determined. The
amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section shall bear interest
from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a
rate equal to the Prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to
the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the
payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a
year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the purchase price adjustment is not intended
to be used by Purchaser to dispute the accounting principles, policies,
methods or practices applied by Chemtura in preparing the Audited Financial
Statements, Business Balance Sheet or Base Closing Working Capital in each
case, to the extent such principles, policies, methods or practices were
applied in accordance with (i) GAAP, (ii) the adjustments set forth on Section
3.5(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules (in the case of the Business Balance
Sheet) or (iii) the Calculation Principles (in the case of the Base Closing
Working Capital). Payments made pursuant to this Section 1.8 will be made and
treated by the parties for all purposes as an adjustment to the Aggregate
Purchase Price and will not be subject to setoff in respect of any amount
owing or claimed to be owing among the parties or any of their Affiliates for
any reason, other than any amounts set off pursuant to clause (C) of the last
paragraph of Section 1.8(a).

  

  

Section 1.9. Withholding. Purchaser shall not withhold any Tax from the
Aggregate Purchase Price actually paid to Chemtura, as agent for all Sellers,
pursuant to Sections 1.5 or 1.8 except to the extent that Purchaser is
required by applicable Law (taking into account any applicable Tax treaty) to
withhold and remit to the applicable Taxing Authority any such Tax (in which
case any such amount withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid);
provided that if either party becomes aware that any amount is required to be
so withheld, it shall promptly (in any event, no later than two Business Days
prior to any such withholding) notify the other party of any such required
withholding and the parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith
(including by taking all commercially reasonable actions requested by the
other party to the extent such actions would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse impact on the requested party) to minimize or
eliminate such withholding Taxes; provided, further, that Purchaser shall
provide to Chemtura within 30 days of any such payment to the applicable
Taxing Authority a certified copy of a receipt issued by the Taxing Authority
evidencing the payment of such Taxes to the extent such a receipt is
available, a copy of the return reporting the payment of such Taxes or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory Chemtura.

Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Chemtura shall deliver to
Purchaser, in writing, a proposed allocation of the Aggregate Purchase Price
among the Equity Interests of the Transferred Entities and the Transferred
Assets. For U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, such proposal
will further allocate the Aggregate Purchase Price among the assets of any
Transferred Entity that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (other than such a Transferred Entity that is a subsidiary
of a Transferred Entity that is not itself a disregarded entity) and
references to Transferred Assets for purposes of this Section 2.4 shall
include references to any assets of a Transferred Entity for which such
further allocation is made, as the context requires. No later than the tenth
Business Day following Purchaser's receipt of such proposed allocation,
Purchaser shall deliver to Chemtura, in writing, any good faith objections to
such proposed allocation. If Purchaser does not deliver to Chemtura any such
objections, the allocation proposed by Chemtura shall become final. If
Purchaser delivers to Chemtura any such objections pursuant to this Section
2.4, the parties shall resolve any disagreements in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 1.7(c), provided that the parties acknowledge
and agree that, to the extent applicable, the provisions of Section 1060 of
the Code shall govern the purchase of the Transferred Assets. In the event an
adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price is made pursuant to Section 1.6 or
otherwise under this Agreement (and any distributions, refunds and/or other
payments are made in connection therewith), the allocation of the Aggregate
Purchase Price shall be revised to allocate such adjustment to the Equity
Interests of the Transferred Entities or Transferred Assets, as the case may
be, based upon the item to which such adjustment is attributable. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, to the extent any such adjustment to the Aggregate
Purchase Price cannot be allocated to a specific asset or jurisdiction, and
the parties cannot agree to a method to allocate such unallocated Aggregate
Purchase Price, the parties shall resolve the issues in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 1.7(c). To the extent permitted by Law, (a)
the allocation described above shall be binding on the parties for U.S.
federal, state, local, foreign and other Tax reporting purposes, (b) no party
will assert or maintain a position inconsistent with such allocation and (c)
the applicable Tax Returns to be filed by any of the parties or their
Subsidiaries shall reflect such allocation.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CHEMTURA

  

  

Chemtura hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser that, as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date, except as set forth on the disclosure
schedules delivered by Chemtura to Purchaser concurrently herewith (the
"Disclosure Schedules"):

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 3.1. Due Organization. Each Seller and Transferred Entity is a legal
entity of the type described in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedules, duly
organized, validly existing and, with respect to entities organized within the
United States and any other jurisdiction outside the United States in which
the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is applicable, in
good standing or its functional equivalent under the Laws of the jurisdiction
indicated in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedules. Sellers and the
Transferred Entities (a) have all requisite power and authority under their
respective organizational documents to conduct the Business as it is conducted
as of the date hereof, and (b) are duly qualified or otherwise authorized to
do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the ownership, operation or
leasing of the Transferred Assets or the assets of any Transferred Entity and
the conduct of the Business requires such entity to be so qualified or
otherwise authorized, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified
or otherwise authorized or in good standing would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.2. Authority.

  

  

(a) Each Seller has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of the Transaction Documents to which such Seller
is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the applicable Seller, and no other corporate or other proceedings on
the part of any Seller are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been, and upon their
execution the Transaction Documents shall have been, duly executed and
delivered by each Seller party thereto, and, assuming due authorization and
delivery by Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution
the Transaction Documents shall constitute, a valid and binding obligation of
each Seller party thereto, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
their respective terms, except (a) as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or
by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (b) that specific
performance may not be available (collectively, the "Enforceability
Exceptions").

  

  

(b) All corporate actions taken by the Transferred Entities in connection with
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will be duly authorized on
or prior to the Closing.

  

  

Section 3.3. Transferred Entities; Title to Equity Interests. Section 3.3 of
the Disclosure Schedules sets forth, with respect to each Transferred Entity,
as of the date hereof, (a) the number of authorized equity interests, (b) the
total number of equity interests thereof that are outstanding, (c) the
identity of each holder of such equity interests, (d) the number of equity
interests held by each such holder, and (e) the percentage of the total
outstanding equity interests held by Sellers or other Transferred Entities, as
the case may be (each such equity interest held by a Seller or Transferred
Entity, an "Equity Interest"). As of the date hereof, there are no other
authorized or outstanding equity interests of any Transferred Entity, and
there are no authorized or outstanding equity interests convertible into or
exchangeable for any other equity interests of any Transferred Entity. Sellers
and the Transferred Entities are not, and prior to the Closing Date will not
become, a party to or subject to any contract or obligation wherein any third
party has, or will have, a right, option or warrant to purchase or acquire any
rights in any equity interests of the Transferred Entities. There are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or proxies or other agreements or
understandings in effect with respect to the voting of the Equity Interests.
All Equity Interests held by Sellers or a Transferred Entity have been duly
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any
Encumbrances, except for Encumbrances arising in connection with this
Agreement and those imposed by Purchaser. None of the Equity Interests held by
Sellers or a Transferred Entity was issued in violation of any preemptive
rights. Each Seller which holds an Equity Interest in a Transferred Entity has
good title thereto and full beneficial ownership thereof and upon delivery of
such Equity Interest against payment therefor pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (or the applicable International Stock Purchase Agreement),
Purchaser will receive good title thereto and full beneficial ownership
thereof, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 3.4. No Conflict; Government Authorizations.

  

  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents by Sellers and the consummation by Sellers of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i) violate or conflict
with any organizational documents of any Seller or Transferred Entity, (ii)
violate, conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a default by
(or create an event which, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default by) Seller or any Transferred Entity, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Encumbrance (except for Permitted Encumbrances) upon any of the Transferred
Assets or any assets of any Transferred Entity under, any Material Contract or
Business Real Property Lease, or (iii) violate or result in a breach of any
Permit primarily relating to the Business or used or held for use primarily in
connection with the Business or of any Governmental Order or, subject to the
matters described in Section 3.4(b), Law applicable to the Business, in each
case except as set forth on Section 3.4(a) of the Disclosure Schedules and, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), except as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Except as provided in Section 5.6(a) with respect to the HSR Act and
required foreign antitrust filings and/or notices, no consent of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Authority
is required to be obtained or made by any of the Sellers in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, other than such consents, registrations, declarations,
notices or filings that, if not obtained, would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

related audited combined statements of income, comprehensive income (loss),
net parent investment and cash flows of the Business for the twelve months

(i) Liabilities disclosed on the Business Balance Sheet or in the balance
sheet as at December 31, 2012 included in the Audited Financial Statements,
(ii) Liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since December

and the other Transaction Documents, (a) since December 31, 2013 until the
date hereof, (i) Sellers have operated the Business in the Ordinary Course of
Business in all material respects, and (ii) neither any Seller nor any
Transferred Entity, in each case only as it relates to the Business, has taken
or agreed to take any action that, if taken or agreed to after the date hereof
without Purchaser's consent, would be a violation of Section 5.1, and (b)

21  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) There are no material Encumbrances for Taxes upon any of the Transferred
Assets or any of the assets of the Transferred Entities, except for any
Encumbrances for Taxes not yet due and payable, or which are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings or may thereafter be paid without
penalty, and for which adequate reserves have been maintained.

  

  

(c) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Chemtura, threatened audits,
examinations or other administrative or court proceedings for the assessment,
adjustment or collection of a material amount of Taxes of the Transferred
Entities or of Sellers specifically relating to the Business, and none of the
Sellers nor any of the Transferred Entities has received, within the past five
years, any written notice of any claims, actions, suits, proceedings or

amount of Taxes specifically relating to the Business that have not been
withdrawn, settled or paid in full.

  

  

(d) There are no outstanding written requests, agreements, consents or waivers

corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law); (ii)
installment sale or open transaction disposition occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date; (iii) any method of accounting; or (iv) prepaid amount received

of all private letter rulings, revenue agent reports, information document
requests, notices of proposed deficiencies, deficiency notices, protests,
petitions, closing agreements, settlement agreements, pending ruling requests
and any similar documents submitted by, received by, or agreed to by or on
behalf of any Transferred Entity relating to Taxes for the current taxable

States trade or Business.

  

  

(k) Each of the Transferred Entities listed in Section 3.7(k) of the

be treated as, or is otherwise classified by default under Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-3(b)(2) as, a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. With the exception of the Transferred Entities listed in
Section 3.7(k) of the Disclosure Schedules, all of the Transferred Entities
are characterized as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

  

  

(l) No Transferred Entity has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (i)
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Law) by virtue of such Transferred Entity
having been a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary, affiliated or
similar Tax group prior to Closing, (ii) as a transferee or successor, or
(iii) by contract entered into prior to Closing (other than any customary

Section 3.8. Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) Section 3.8(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules contains a list of all
Registered Intellectual Property and Software owned by the Sellers and the
Transferred Entities that is necessary for the conduct of the Business as
conducted on the date hereof.

  

  

(b) Sellers and the Transferred Entities own or have rights to use all
Business Intellectual Property that is material to the Business, free and
clear of any Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. To the Knowledge
of Chemtura, no valid intellectual property rights held by any third party are
infringed by the manufacture, sale and/or use as recommended by the Business
of any of the products offered for sale by the Business. To the Knowledge of
Chemtura, all of the Sellers' and Transferred Entities' Registered
Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable. There are no pending, or to
the Knowledge of Chemtura, threatened, actions, suits or proceedings pending
against Sellers alleging that the conduct of the Business infringes or
otherwise misappropriates Intellectual Property of any third Person and, to
the Knowledge of Chemtura, no third Person is infringing any Business
Intellectual Property owned or exclusively licensed by the Sellers or the
Transferred Entities, except in each case as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. No current and former
employees or independent contractors have any ownership interest in or right
to any Transferred Intellectual Property or any Business Intellectual Property
owned by the Sellers or any of the Transferred Entities that, if asserted
successfully, would burden, impair or prevent the use of such Intellectual

Section 4.6. Financing.

  

  

(a) Attached hereto as Exhibit C is a true and complete copy, including all
exhibits, schedules or amendments thereto, of the fully executed commitment
letter from Barclays Bank PLC, dated as of the date hereof (the "Debt
Commitment Letter") from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the
"Lenders") relating to the commitment of the Lenders to provide debt financing
in the aggregate amount, and subject to the terms and conditions, set forth
therein (the "Debt Financing"), and any fee letters related thereto (provided,
that the amount of fees, "market flex" provisions, pricing terms and pricing
caps set forth in the fee letters, none of which would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing, or reduce the aggregate principal amount
thereof, may be redacted in a customary manner from any such fee letters,
including from any amendments thereto). Subject to the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter and closing the financing set forth therein,
Purchaser will have at the Closing, sufficient funds on hand to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and
deliver the Aggregate Purchase Price and all fees and expenses related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents at
Closing.

  

  

(b) The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is valid and
enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms, except
(i) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) that the
availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be
brought. The aggregate proceeds contemplated to be provided by the Debt
Commitment Letter, together with any cash on hand of the Purchaser at Closing
and the Stock Consideration, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all of Purchaser's related fees and
expenses. The obligations of the Lenders to fund the commitments under the
Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or any contingencies that
would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing.
There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements
(except for customary fee letters and engagement letters) relating to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set
forth in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent the same are due and
payable. As of the date of this Agreement, (x) the Debt Commitment Letter has
not been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and the respective commitments have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any way and (ii) no event has occurred that (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or default under the
Debt Commitment Letter by Purchaser. Purchaser has no knowledge of any facts
or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in (A) any of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter not being satisfied or (ii)
the funding contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter not being made
available to Purchaser on a timely basis in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

promulgated thereunder applicable to the Purchaser SEC Documents. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such amendment), the Purchaser SEC Documents did not, and any Purchaser SEC
Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any
Purchaser SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed
Purchaser SEC Document, none of the Purchaser SEC Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. For purposes of this Section 4.7, "Purchaser" shall be deemed to
include MacDermid, Incorporated.

  

  

(b) There are no Liabilities of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that would

and prior to the Closing Date will not, become a party to or subject to any
contract or obligation wherein any third party has, or will have, a right,
option or warrant to purchase or acquire any rights in any equity interests of
Purchaser. Except as set forth on Section 4.8 of the Disclosure Schedules,
there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or proxies or other
agreements or understandings in effect with respect to the voting of the

other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which holders
of Purchaser Common Stock may vote. Since December 31, 2013 through the date

(d) Chemtura and Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, all records and
other information relating to the Business and all employees and auditors
(including by making them available for depositions, interrogatories,
testimony, investigation and preparation in connection with any legal or
arbitration proceeding) available to the other as may be reasonably required
by such party (i) in connection with, among other things, any audit or
investigation of, insurance claims by, legal proceedings against, disputes
involving or governmental investigations of any Seller or Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates, (ii) in order to enable any Seller or Purchaser
to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and each
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or
(iii) for any other reasonable business purpose relating to any Seller,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries, but
excluding, in each case, any dispute between Chemtura or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, except as would be required by applicable civil process or
applicable discovery rules.

  

  

Section 5.5. Post-Closing Confidential Information. Chemtura agrees that for a
period of five years from and after the Closing Date (except with respect to
Trade Secrets of the Business, in which case the confidentiality obligations
in this Section 5.5. will remain in effect so long as such Trade Secrets
remain trade secrets under applicable Law), it and the other Sellers shall
hold and maintain the confidentiality of all confidential or proprietary
information concerning the Business or the Transferred Assets (the
"Confidential Information"), and shall not use disclose or cause or permit to
be used or disclosed to any third party any of the Confidential Information
for any reason or purpose whatsoever, except to the extent any disclosure of
Confidential Information is required by Law or appropriate Governmental Order
and sufficient advance written notice of such use or disclosure, if reasonably
practicable and permitted by Law, is provided to Purchaser so that Purchaser
may seek, at its own expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy;
provided that the term "Confidential Information" shall not include
information that (a) does not relate primarily to the Business, (b) relates to
any Transferred Entities Excluded Asset, Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability,
(c) becomes available to any Seller or any of its Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser, (d) is independently
developed by any Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective employees
under circumstances not involving a breach of this Section 5.5, (e) is
publicly disclosed pursuant to a lawful requirement or request from a
Governmental Authority acting within its jurisdiction, or non-confidential
disclosure is otherwise required by Law, (f) is publicly available as of the
Closing Date, or which becomes publicly available after the Closing Date
through no fault of any Seller or its Affiliates, (g) is disclosed on a
confidential basis to Sellers' attorneys, accountants, lenders and investment

protect or enforce their rights or perform their obligations under this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, in connection with tax or other
regulatory filings, litigation (excluding in connection with any dispute
between Chemtura or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, except as would be acquired by
applicable civil process or applicable discovery rules), financial reporting
or other reasonable business purposes, or the conduct of their own businesses
if, and to the extent, not otherwise prohibited by this Section 5.5.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.6. Required Approvals; Consents.

  

  

(a) Governmental Approvals.

  

  

(i) Without limiting Purchaser's obligations set forth in this Section 5.6,
each of the parties agrees to use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties hereto shall cooperate to make, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, all filings and applications with and to, and
obtain all licenses, permits, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of, applicable Governmental Authorities to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including under
applicable Antitrust Laws).

  

  

(ii) In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereto shall (A) file or
cause to be filed as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the United States
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and any other applicable Governmental
Authority all notification and report forms that may be required for the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter provide as promptly as
practicable any supplemental information requested in connection therewith
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and (B) include in each
such filing, notification and report form referred to in the immediately
preceding clause (A) a request for early termination or acceleration of any
applicable waiting or review periods, to the extent available under the
applicable Antitrust Law. In connection therewith, each party hereto shall (1)
furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as any such other party may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law, (2) subject to applicable Laws, provide the
other parties with a draft of any filing or submission and a reasonable
opportunity to review such draft before making or causing to be made such
filing or submission, and consider in good faith the views of such other
parties regarding such filing or submission, (3) not extend any applicable
waiting or review periods or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Authority to delay or not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated on the Closing Date, except with the prior written consent
of the other parties, (4) not have any substantive contact with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by
this Section 5.6(a) unless such party has engaged in prior consultation with
the other parties and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
given the other parties the opportunity to participate and (5) keep the other
parties apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries
or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other
applicable Governmental Authority.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

(iii) Purchaser further agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to take,
any action to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, including (A) the prompt use of its best efforts to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or
judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (1)
the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any
court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental
Authority, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of such transactions, (2) the proffer and agreement by Purchaser
or its Affiliates of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect
the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets,
rights, product lines, categories of assets or businesses or other operations
or interests therein of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, any Transferred Entity) (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect
thereto) no later than 60 days from the date of this Agreement and (3) the
proffer and agreement by Purchaser and its Affiliates of their willingness to
take such other actions, and promptly to effect such other actions (and the
entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Governmental Authority giving effect thereto) no later than 60 days from the
date of this Agreement, in each case if such action should be reasonably
necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual,
anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or
(y) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority
and (B) the prompt use of its best efforts to take, in the event that any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind
that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal
thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or
threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.6(a)(iii) shall
obligate Purchaser or its Affiliates to agree to any divestitures or other
remedy not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing. Neither Purchaser
nor Chemtura shall, nor shall they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries
to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the
applicable clearance, approval, consent or waiver from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(iv) The filing fees under the HSR Act, other Antitrust Laws and all other
applicable Laws shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Chemtura.

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Third-Party Consents. Purchaser and Chemtura shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents required
under any Transferred Contracts or Transferred Real Property Leases with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as promptly as possible after the date hereof; provided that (i)
neither Purchaser nor Chemtura (or any of its Affiliates, including the other
Sellers or the Transferred Entities) shall be obligated to pay any
consideration to any third party from whom consent is requested, and (ii)
obtaining any such consent shall not be a condition to Closing. In furtherance
of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to provide such assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any third party whose consent is sought hereunder.

  

  

Section 5.7. Further Action.

  

  

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Purchaser and Chemtura shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions (within their respective control) necessary or appropriate
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from time to time after the Closing
Date, and for no further consideration, Purchaser and Chemtura shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered,
such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents and
instruments and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to
appropriately consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including (a)
transferring back to any Seller (or Affiliate of any Seller) designated by
Chemtura any asset or Liability which was not contemplated by this Agreement
to be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing but was so transferred at the
Closing and, (b) transferring to Purchaser any asset or Liability contemplated
by this Agreement to be transferred to Purchaser and which was not so
transferred at the Closing (such transfers to be deemed to have been made at
or prior to the Closing).

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Chemtura will amend, or cause to be amended, any
organizational documents (including articles of association, bylaws, limited
liability company agreements, and other similar documents) of certain
Transferred Entities and Sellers so that the consummation of the Closing will
not violate or conflict with such organizational documents.

  

  

(c) Thirty days prior to the anticipated Closing Date and, again at the
Closing, Chemtura shall notify Purchaser in writing of any actions that, to
the Knowledge of Chemtura, must be taken within 120 days after the Closing
Date to maintain, preserve, or renew any Transferred Intellectual Property,
including the payment of any registration, annuity, maintenance or renewal
fees or the filing of any responsive documents.

  

 

  

Section 5.8. Expenses.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party hereto incurring
such expenses, except as expressly indicated otherwise in this Agreement.
Other than in respect of VAT (which shall be governed exclusively by Section
5.8(b)), Purchaser and Chemtura shall each pay 50% of any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes or
notarial fees incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement (all such items so incurred are referred to herein collectively
as "Transfer Taxes"). All necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall be filed by Purchaser; provided that
the relevant Seller will reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in the
preparation, execution and filing of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation as necessary.

  

  

(b) All consideration specified for supplies of goods or services made, or
deemed to be made, under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents
(including any transfer of assets contemplated hereunder, but excluding any
transfer of assets or services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement
or the Supply Agreement which transfers shall be governed by the terms of such
agreements) shall be exclusive of any and all applicable VAT. With respect to
each such supply of goods or services, the party hereto that makes such supply
(or whose Affiliate makes such supply) (the "Supply Provider") shall provide,
or cause its Affiliate making such supply to provide, to the party hereto that
receives such supply (or whose Affiliate receives such supply) (the "Supply
Recipient"), or to the Affiliate of the Supply Recipient receiving such
supply, a properly completed and executed VAT invoice (or other valid and
customary VAT documentation) with respect to the relevant supply of goods or
services, promptly and in accordance with applicable Law. After the receipt of
such invoice or documentation, the Supply Recipient shall pay on the Closing
Date, or cause its Affiliate receiving such supply to pay on the Closing Date,
to the Supply Provider or its Affiliate making such supply, in addition to the
specified consideration, all VAT required under applicable Law to be charged
by the Supply Provider or its Affiliate in relation to such supply, in
accordance with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
the Supply Recipient applies for but does not receive a refund of such VAT
payments from the appropriate Governmental Authority, the Supply Provider
shall reimburse the Supply Recipient for 50% of the amount of such VAT
payments not refunded.

  

  

Section 5.9. Employees and Employee Benefit Plans. This Section 5.9 contains
the covenants and agreements of the parties with respect to (i) the status of
employment of the employees employed in the Business as of the Closing Date,
including Shared Employees but excluding Excluded Employees ("Employees"),
upon the sale of the Business to Purchaser, and (ii) the employee benefits
provided to and employee benefit plans covering such Employees and former
employees of Chemtura and its Affiliates who terminated employment with
Chemtura and its Affiliates while employed in the Business by a Transferred
Entity or who retired from the Transferred Entity prior to the Closing Date
("Former Employees").

  

  

(a) United States Employees. This Section 5.9(a) applies to Employees employed
in the United States Business as of the Closing Date, and Former Employees who
terminated employment with Chemtura and its Affiliates while employed in the
United States Business.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) Continuation of Employment; Assumption of Current Liabilities for
Employees. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
an Affiliate to, offer employment to (A) all Dedicated Employees with respect
to the United States Business and the Shared Employees with respect to the
United States Business in either case if then actively at work, or on any form
of leave other than employees on long-term disability leave or leave for
military service. Such Employees accepting Purchaser's or its Affiliate's
offer, will become "Transferred U.S. Employees" as of the Effective Time. For
those Employees who would otherwise be required to be offered employment by
Purchaser or an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 5.9(a)(i) but who are on
long-term disability leave as of the Effective Time and described on Section
5.9(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliate to, offer employment to each such Employee to the extent he recovers
from his disability and presents himself to Purchaser or such Affiliate for
active employment prior to the Closing Date. For those Employees who would
otherwise be required to be offered employment by Purchaser or an Affiliate
pursuant to this Section 5.9(a)(i) but who are on leave for military service
as of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to,
offer employment to each such Employee to the extent he presents himself to
Purchaser or such Affiliate for active employment within the period his
reemployment rights are guaranteed by applicable Law. Each Employee described
in the two preceding sentences who accepts Purchaser's (or its Affiliate's)
offer of employment will become a Transferred U.S. Employee as of the date he
returns to work with Purchaser or its Affiliate. Terms of employment
continuation for each Transferred U.S. Employee (I) shall require employment
at the same work location and (II) shall, for the one year period commencing
on the Closing Date, provide (a) a base wage rate, (b) an incentive
compensation opportunity and (c) health (including medical, dental and vision
care), life insurance, disability, flexible spending account, and retirement
savings (but not defined benefit retirement) benefits that are not less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Transferred U.S.
Employees by Chemtura and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (III) otherwise comply with all other applicable provisions of this
Section 5.9(a). Purchaser shall credit, or shall cause its Affiliates to
credit, each Transferred U.S. Employee's service with Chemtura and its
Affiliates for eligibility, participation, benefit accrual and vesting.
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall honor any recall or re-employment rights
mandated by applicable Law or by contract of any Employees or Former
Employees. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall comply at its
expense with all employment Laws with respect to the period of employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates of the Transferred U.S. Employees, including the
Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and federal
or state Laws on military leave. Purchaser shall likewise honor and assume all
liability for accrued wages (other than the retention bonuses listed on
Section 5.9(a)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules) and current year bonus
entitlement through the Closing Date for all Transferred U.S. Employees to the
extent such liabilities are taken into account and reflected in the Closing
Working Capital. Nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed to,
limit the ability of Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Transferred
U.S. Employee at any time after the Closing Date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) Severance Protection. From and after the Closing Date, Transferred U.S.
Employees shall be entitled to the benefit of such severance plan or policy,
if any, as Purchaser or its Affiliates may have in effect from time to time;
provided that service with Chemtura, Purchaser, and their respective
Affiliates shall be taken into account in computing the amount of such
benefit; provided, further, that if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
terminates the employment of any Transferred U.S. Employee on or before the
first anniversary of the Closing Date (including as a result of refusal of any
Transferred U.S. Employee to accept a work relocation that is greater than
fifty miles from his work location as of the Closing Date), Purchaser or its
Affiliate shall provide a severance benefit consisting of salary continuation
and continued insurance coverage that shall be no less than the severance
benefit the Transferred U.S. Employee would have received under the terms of
an Employee Transferor's severance plan(s), as applicable, in effect on the
Closing Date, calculated as though the Transferred U.S. Employee worked
continuously (by combining such Transferred U.S. Employee's service for
Chemtura and its Affiliates on the one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates
on the other hand) until his termination date with Purchaser or its Affiliate.

  

  

(iii) Cooperation. To the extent permitted by Law and subject to Purchaser
entering into a business associate agreement satisfactory to Chemtura, the
United States Business agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate the transition of Transferred U.S. Employees to employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliate as of the Effective Time or such later time as may
be required by Section 5.9(a)(i), including without limitation providing a
list to the Purchaser of the salaried and hourly persons who are designated on
the records of any Employee Transferor as of the Closing Date as dedicated
Employees with respect to the United States Business.

  

  

(iv) Savings Plan. Effective as of the time the Employees become Transferred
U.S. Employees, Transferred U.S. Employees shall cease to be eligible to
contribute to the Chemtura 401(k) Plan ("Sellers' Savings Plan"). Effective as
of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or otherwise maintain, or shall
cause its Affiliate to establish or otherwise maintain, one or more tax-
qualified defined contribution savings plans ("Purchaser's Savings Plans")
that shall (1) permit participation as promptly as practicable for the
Transferred U.S. Employees who were eligible to participate in Sellers'
Savings Plan as of the day before the Closing Date; (2) credit all service
that was credited under Sellers' Savings Plan for purposes of the eligibility,
vesting and match eligibility requirements of the Purchaser's Savings Plans;
(3) provide for tax-deferred contributions pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
Code and (4) accept elective direct rollovers of Transferred U.S. Employees'
accounts and loans under Sellers' Savings Plan to the extent payable in cash.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser's Savings Plan shall not be
required to offer participation to any Transferred U.S. Employee prior to the
date he becomes a Transferred U.S. Employee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

(v) Employee Welfare Plans.

  

  

(A) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, not later than the Closing Date,
provide the Transferred U.S. Employees and their spouses, domestic partners,
dependents and beneficiaries with health and life insurance, disability,
severance, and other welfare benefit plans and programs as Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall determine, subject to the requirements of this Section 5.9.
Subject to any specific provision of this Section 5.9 to the contrary, Sellers
shall remain solely responsible for liabilities or obligations incurred with
respect to each Transferred U.S. Employee or Former Employee and their
spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under any of Sellers' medical and life
insurance, disability, severance and other welfare benefit plans and programs
for liabilities or obligations incurred prior to the Closing Date; and
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for liabilities or
obligations incurred with respect to each Transferred U.S. Employee and their
spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under any of the Purchaser's, or any
Transferred Entity's health (including medical, dental and vision care) and
life insurance, disability, severance and other welfare benefit plans and
programs for liabilities incurred on or after the Closing Date. For purposes
of this Section 5.9(a)(v), a liability or obligation shall be deemed to be
incurred upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to the liability or
obligation and the liability or obligation will include any covered expenses
for any related claims or series of related claims giving rise to such
liability or obligation; provided that in the case of medical and dental
expenses, including under any flexible spending account plan, a liability and
obligation shall be deemed to be incurred only as and when the service(s) in
respect of such expense occurs.

  

  

(B) Any plans or programs established or maintained by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to provide health (including medical, dental and vision care) and
life insurance, disability, severance, vacation, cafeteria, flexible spending,
dependent care and other welfare benefits for the benefit of the Transferred
U.S. Employees shall, (1) credit all service credited by Chemtura and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility, participation,
benefit accrual and benefit entitlement, (2) waive any pre-existing condition
limitation or exclusion or any actively-at-work requirement, (3) credit all
payments made for healthcare expenses during the current plan year for
purposes of deductibles, co-payments and maximum out-of-pocket limits and (4)
subject to Section 5.9(a) and Section 5.9(c), until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date provide benefit plan designs and cost sharing features that
are the same as those provided to other similarly situated employees of
Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

(vi) Severance and WARN Act Liability. Purchaser agrees to pay and be
responsible for (A) except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
all liability, cost or expense for severance, salary continuation, special
bonuses and like costs under Purchaser's and its Subsidiaries' (including the
Transferred Entities') severance pay plans, retention agreements, policies or
arrangements and (B) any payment obligations described in Section 5.9(a)(ii)
with respect to any of the Transferred U.S. Employees that arise on or after
the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not at any time prior to
90 days after the Closing Date effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
as such terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act of 1988 ("WARN") or effectuate any similar triggering event under any
other applicable Law, affecting in whole or in part any site of employment,
facility, operating unit or Transferred U.S. Employee. Purchaser agrees to
provide any required notice under WARN and any other applicable Law and to
otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or any similar triggering event under any
other applicable Law occurring on or after the Closing or arising as a result
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(vii) Health Care Continuation Coverage. With respect to all health plans
maintained for Transferred U.S. Employees, Purchaser agrees to provide
(directly or through its Affiliates) continuation coverage required by COBRA
to all Transferred U.S. Employees and their covered beneficiaries who are
entitled to COBRA coverage with respect to qualifying events that occur after
the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to pay and be responsible for all
liability, cost, expense, taxes and sanctions under Section 4980B of the Code,
and interest and penalties imposed upon, incurred by, or assessed against
Purchaser or an Employee Transferor that arise with respect to the Transferred
U.S. Employees and their covered beneficiaries after the Closing Date by
reason of, or relating to, any failure by Purchaser and its Affiliates to
comply with the health care continuation coverage requirements of COBRA.

  

  

(viii) Worker's Compensation. Purchaser shall be responsible for the
administration and the financial obligation of all worker's compensation
claims with respect to the Transferred U.S. Employees arising out of or
relating to occurrences on or after the Closing Date and Sellers shall be
responsible for the administration and the financial obligation of all
worker's compensation claims arising out of or relating to occurrences before
the Closing Date; provided that the following specific principles shall apply
to the following specific claims:

  

  

(A) Modified Duty. If, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser fails to continue to accommodate the modified or alternative work
arrangements that are currently in place for a Transferred U.S. Employee (the
"Modified Duty Employees"), except if such failure to accommodate is the
result of a termination of such Modified Duty Employee's employment for cause,
then the Employee Transferors and Purchaser shall share the applicable
worker's compensation liability, as determined by the applicable worker's
compensation state Law, in proportion to the length of time such Modified Duty
Employee was on modified duty with an Employee Transferor before the Closing
Date and Purchaser after the Closing Date. If such failure to accommodate
described in the preceding sentence occurs with respect to a Modified Duty
Employee following the first anniversary of the Closing Date or if a Modified
Duty Employee voluntarily leaves employment at any time for any reason other
than an unjustified failure by Purchaser to accommodate, then the Employee
Transferors shall bear all applicable worker's compensation liability with
respect to such Modified Duty Employee and Purchaser shall not share any of
such liability with the Employee Transferors.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

(B) Aggravated Injury. In the event that a Transferred U.S. Employee notifies
Purchaser after the Closing Date of a worker's compensation injury that is the
result of an aggravation of an injury that occurred prior to the Closing Date,
the responsibility for the administration and financial obligation of this
claim (i.e., the allocation between Sellers' worker's compensation coverage
and Purchaser's worker's compensation coverage) will be determined by the
applicable worker's compensation Law and is subject to the final
interpretation of the appropriate court.

  

  

(ix) No Assumption of Plans. Except for the assumption of the Labor Contracts
as provided in Section 5.9(c)(i)(A), and except as set forth on Section
5.9(a)(ix) of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans"),
neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates nor any Transferred Entity shall assume
any U.S. Benefit Plan. To the extent Chemtura deems necessary in its
reasonable judgment, Sellers shall cause each Transferred Entity to (A)
withdraw from or otherwise terminate its participation under each U.S. Benefit
Plan (other than the Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans) or (B) if any U.S.
Benefit Plan other than a Transferred U.S. Benefit Plan is maintained or
sponsored solely by one or more Transferred Entities, terminate such plan,
with such withdrawal or termination of participation or plan termination
effective no later than the Closing Date.

  

  

(x) Paid-Time Off. Effective with the date an Employee becomes a Transferred
U.S. Employee, Purchaser shall assume liability for any earned but not taken
paid-time off time (including any non-forfeitable paid-time off entitlement
otherwise payable only on termination of employment) of the Transferred U.S.
Employee prior to the Closing Date to the extent such liabilities are taken
into account and reflected in the Closing Working Capital. For a period of at
least one year following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Transferred U.S.
Employees with an annual paid-time off entitlement that is no less favorable
than the more favorable of (i) the entitlement provided by Purchaser to its
similarly situated employees as of the Closing Date and (ii) the entitlement
required to be provided by applicable Law. Upon any Transferred U.S. Employee
ceasing to be employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate at any time after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, pay in full
the value of the Transferred U.S. Employee\'s accrued but unused annual paid-
time off entitlement, and remaining carried over paid-time off entitlement, if
any, to the Transferred U.S. Employee.

(b) Non-U.S. Employees. This Section 5.9(b) applies only to Employees employed
in the Non-United States Business as of the Closing Date, and Former Employees
who terminated employment with Chemtura or its Affiliates while employed in
the Non-United States Business.

  

  

(i) Employment. Each Dedicated Employee employed by the Employee Transferors
or the Transferred Entities or any Affiliate of either whose working time is
dedicated to the Non-United States Business, whether hourly or salaried, and
who is actively at work on the Closing Date, or who is absent on the Closing
Date due to a recognized leave of absence, whether paid or unpaid, and the
Shared Employees with respect to the Non-United States Business, shall be
referred to as a "Non-U.S. Employee." Wherever legally permissible, on the
Closing Date, Non-U.S. Employees shall become employees of Purchaser or
continue to be employees of a Transferred Entity by operation of the
applicable Laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which such employment is
located (the "National Laws", which term shall include the EU Acquired Rights
Directive, where applicable) and/or pursuant to the terms of any necessary
transfer agreement relating to that jurisdiction. Where such continuation of
employment or transfer is not possible in the manner described in the previous
sentence, Purchaser shall offer the Non-U.S. Employees employment in
accordance with the procedures required by applicable National Laws to
effectuate their employment with Purchaser or a Transferred Entity commencing
on the Closing Date. Each Non-U.S. Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is
employed by, or otherwise has his employment continued with, a Transferred
Entity, otherwise transfers to the employ of Purchaser or a Transferred Entity
pursuant to National Laws or accepts Purchaser's offer of employment shall be
referred to as a "Transferred Non-U.S. Employee." No provision herein shall
impair, deny or limit the right of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to
change the employment terms or to terminate the employment of any Transferred
Non-U.S. Employee at any time, to the extent permissible under applicable
National Laws and any applicable Labor Contract.

Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide Transferred Non-U.S.
Employees with terms and conditions of employment, compensation and employee
benefits that are consistent with those (A) provided under the Transferred
Non-U.S. Employee's employment contract, if applicable or (B) if more
favorable (or if the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee does not have a contract),
required by applicable National Laws or an applicable Labor Contract. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section
5.9(b)(iii)(C) below, if applicable, from and after the Closing Date,
Transferred Non-U.S. Employees shall be entitled to at least the benefit of
such severance plan or policy, if any, as Purchaser or its Affiliates may have
in effect from time to time; provided that service with Chemtura, Purchaser,
and their respective Affiliates shall be taken into account in computing the
amount of such benefit, and, provided, further, that if Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates terminates the employment of any Transferred Non-U.S. Employee
on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date (including as a result
of refusal of any Transferred Non-U.S. Employee to accept a work relocation
that is greater than 50 miles from his work location as of the Closing Date),
Purchaser or its Affiliate shall provide at least a severance benefit
consisting of salary continuation and continued insurance coverage, if any,
that shall be no less than the severance benefit and insurance coverage the
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee would have received under the terms of an
Employer Transferor's or a Transferred Entity's severance plan(s), as
applicable, in effect on the Closing Date, calculated as though the
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee worked continuously (by combining such
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee's service for Chemtura and its Affiliates on the
one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates on the other hand) until his
termination date with Purchaser or its Affiliate.

  

  

(iii) Foreign Benefit Plans. "Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans" means those
Foreign Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedules to
the extent they cover the Transferred Non-U.S. Employees.

  

  

(A) Except to the extent otherwise required by Law and except for those of
Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans set forth on Section 5.9(b)(iii)(A) of the
Disclosure Schedules (the "Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans"), as of the
Closing Date, each Transferred Non-U.S. Employee shall cease to be an active
participant in Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

(B) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall establish or
maintain employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements outside of the
United States in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable
National Laws that, in accordance with the obligation to provide total
compensation and employee benefits as provided in Section 5.9(b)(ii), (1)
provide employee benefits on the same terms and conditions as provided under
the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee's employment contract, if applicable or (2)
if more favorable than the employee benefits described in clause (1) (or if
the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee does not have a contract), provide employee
benefits as required by applicable National Laws (collectively, "Purchaser's
Foreign Benefit Plans"). The Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans and the

liabilities under or with respect to such plans) will be transferred or
assigned to Purchaser or its Affiliates (or, in the case of such assets,
property or funds, to the applicable plan or plans so established or
maintained) no later than the Closing Date. With respect to any Sellers'
Foreign Benefit Plans that are not transferred to Purchaser as provided in the
preceding sentence and to the extent not otherwise required by Law, Sellers
shall cooperate to cause each Transferred Entity to (x) withdraw from or
otherwise terminate its participation under such Foreign Benefit Plans or (y)
if any such Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plan is maintained or sponsored solely by
one or more Transferred Entities, terminate such plan or merge such plan with
another plan of an Employee Transferor such that the obligations of the
Transferred Entity are assumed by an Employee Transferor, with such withdrawal
or termination of participation or plan termination or merger effective no
later than the Closing Date.

  

  

(C) Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Non-U.S. Employee with full
credit for service with Chemtura and its Affiliates and Purchaser for purposes
of eligibility to participate, and vesting and solely with respect to the
Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans (inclusive of related asset, contracts,
property and funds) that are transferred or assigned to Purchaser.

  

  

(D) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall establish or otherwise maintain pension,
retirement and savings plans for Transferred Non-U.S. Employees ("Purchaser's
Foreign Retirement Plans") that shall (1) permit participation as promptly as
practicable on or following the Closing Date, (2) credit all service credited
by Chemtura and its Affiliates as of the Closing, and credit all service with
Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing, for purposes of the
eligibility and vesting and (iii) otherwise fulfill the obligations of
Purchaser as set forth in Section 5.9(b)(iii)(B). With respect to those
Transferred Non-U.S. Employees who were eligible to participate in the
pension, retirement and savings plans set forth on Section 5.9(b)(iii)(D) of
the Disclosure Schedules (collectively "Sellers' Foreign Retirement Plans") as
of the Closing Date, the applicable Purchaser's Foreign Retirement Plans shall
(1) credit all service that was credited under Sellers' Foreign Retirement
Plans, along with future service with Purchaser, for purposes of the
eligibility and vesting; and (2) provide a defined benefit pension benefit,
net of each participating Transferred Non-U.S. Employee's vested accrued
pension benefit as of the Closing Date under Sellers' Foreign Retirement Plans
(unless liability for such benefit is transferred pursuant to Section
5.9(b)(vi) below), on the same terms and conditions, including early
retirement and disability subsidies, as provided under the applicable Sellers'
Foreign Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

(E) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no provision herein shall
impair Purchaser's ability to amend or terminate any such plan at any time to
the extent permissible under applicable National Laws or Labor Contracts.

  

  

(F) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.9(b)(iii) to the contrary,
Seller shall take any necessary actions to cause any Transferred Non-U.S.
Employee in Canada who is covered by the Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans in
Canada to cease participation in such Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans effective
as of the Closing Date. Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, effective as of and
from the Closing Date, establish or designate a replacement defined
contribution registered pension plan for Transferred Non-U.S. Employees in
Canada who, immediately prior to the Closing Date, participate in such
Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans that is a registered pension plan (the "New
Canadian Retirement Plan"). The New Canadian Retirement Plan shall be
identical to the defined contribution provisions of the Sellers' Foreign
Benefit Plans that is a registered pension plan and shall recognize each
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee in Canada\'s period of service prior to the
Closing Date (as recognized in the corresponding Seller's Foreign Benefit Plan
that is a registered pension plan) for purposes of eligibility to join,
vesting and eligibility for benefits under the New Canadian Retirement Plan,
and for purposes of any service based contribution rate for defined
contribution benefits. The benefits accrued to the Closing Date by each
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee in Canada under such Seller Foreign Benefit
Plans shall remain the responsibility and liability of Sellers.

  

  

(iv) Termination and Severance Liabilities. Purchaser shall be responsible for
all amounts becoming payable to Non-U.S. Employees under applicable National
Laws, Purchaser's severance plans or arrangements or any employment contracts
as a result of their being dismissed by (A) Sellers in connection with the
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (B) Purchaser at any time on
or after the Closing Date, notwithstanding that such amounts are calculated
under applicable National Laws, plans, arrangements or employment contracts by
reference to periods of employment with Chemtura and its Affiliates as well as
periods of employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold Sellers harmless against all liability that Sellers may
suffer, incur, sustain or pay arising from any dismissal of the Non-US
Employees described herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

(v) Responsibility for Non-U.S. Employees. Except as otherwise set forth
herein, for employees who are Transferred Non-U.S. Employees as of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall assume and thereafter pay, perform and discharge when
due any and all employment, compensation and employee benefit liabilities,
responsibilities and obligations with respect to such Transferred Non-U.S.
Employees, including any and all claims under National Laws, which
liabilities, responsibilities and obligations are incurred as the result of
incidents, events, acts or failures to act, occurring on or after the Closing
Date.

  

  

(vi) Foreign Benefit Plan Asset Transfers. Sellers may agree to transfer, and
Purchaser may agree to accept in its sole discretion, assets from or with
respect to certain of Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans other than Transferred
Foreign Benefit Plans. If any such plan asset transfers are agreed, Sellers
and Purchaser shall mutually agree upon the terms and conditions of such
transfers, subject to the provisions of each such plan and the requirements of
National Laws. In addition, Sellers and Purchaser may mutually agree to
transfer the liability with respect to benefits accrued or account balances
accumulated as of the applicable transfer date by Transferred Non-U.S.
Employees under such Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans other than Transferred
Foreign Benefit Plans. Where any transfer of assets or liability is agreed to
in respect of a defined benefit pension plan, Sellers' actuaries will
determine, in accordance with reasonable actuarial assumptions approved by
Purchaser's actuaries (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), the
liabilities and assets to be allocated to each of the transferee and
transferor plan or plans consistent with applicable National Laws. Following
the payment or transfer of assets, and to the extent of the liability
attributable to such payment or transfer, Sellers and Sellers' Foreign
Retirement Plans will be discharged from such liability under such Sellers'
Foreign Benefit Plans.

  

  

(vii) Non-U.S. Employee Communications. Each party to this Agreement shall
comply with all obligations under applicable National Laws to provide
information to the other parties for onward transmission to Non-U.S. Employees
or their representatives and/or to provide such information directly to the
Non-U.S. Employees or their representatives. Each party to this Agreement
shall comply with all obligations under applicable National Law to inform
and/or consult trade unions, works councils or other employee representative
bodies in connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

(viii) Cooperation. To the extent permitted by Law and subject to Purchaser
entering into a data privacy agreement satisfactory to Chemtura, Purchaser
shall give to the Employee Transferors, and Sellers shall give, or cause to be
given, to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all requisite and pertinent
information which the Employee Transferors and Purchaser, respectively, may
require in order to comply with their respective obligations with respect to
Employees. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, to the extent
permitted by Law and subject to Purchaser entering into a data privacy
agreement satisfactory to Chemtura, Sellers shall give, or cause to be given,

the transfer to or employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates shall remain (or,
in the case of an employee of a Transferred Entity, shall be) employed by the
Employee Transferors; provided that the Employee Transferors may terminate
such Non-U.S. Employee immediately after Closing, subject to applicable legal
constraints, if any, and shall be solely responsible for any severance payment
or compensation or other benefit to or with respect to such Non-U.S. Employee.
Without prejudice to the generality of Section 5.9(b)(iv), Purchaser shall be
responsible for all costs with respect to such terminations to the extent such
costs arise as a result of Purchaser's failure to comply with the obligations
set forth in Section 5.9(b)(i) and (ii).

  

  

(x) Paid-Time Off. Purchaser shall assume liability for any earned but not
taken paid-time off time (including any non-forfeitable paid-time off
entitlement otherwise payable only on termination of employment) of the
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee prior to the Closing Date to the extent such
liabilities are taken into account and reflected in the Closing Working
Capital. For a period of at least one year following the Closing, Purchaser
shall provide Transferred Non-U.S. Employees with an annual paid-time off
entitlement that is no less favorable than the more favorable of (i) the
entitlement provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees as of
the Closing Date and (ii) the entitlement required to be provided by
applicable Law. Upon any Transferred Non-U.S. Employee ceasing to be employed
by Purchaser or an Affiliate at any time after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, pay in full the value of the
Transferred Non-U.S. Employee\'s accrued but unused annual paid-time off
entitlement, and remaining carried over paid-time off entitlement, if any, to
the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee.

  

  

(c) Labor Contracts.

  

  

(i) Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, assume each of (A) those

Disclosure Schedules (individually, a "Labor Contract" and collectively, the
"Labor Contracts"), and honor and fulfill all of the Employee Transferors'
obligations under each of the Labor Contracts after the Closing Date.
Purchaser and Chemtura shall each cooperate for the purposes of, including
providing the relevant representative of any group covered by a Labor Contract
with required notices, bargaining with the representative, if required by the

any other necessary actions in connection with negotiating any changes in the
terms of employment of the Employees covered by such Labor Contract necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the transfer of employment and Liabilities for
such Employees on terms and conditions consistent with this Section 5.9.
Purchaser shall be exclusively responsible for any Liability incurred in
connection with any negotiated change to such Labor Contracts.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, employ each Employee
whose terms of employment are covered by a Labor Contract on the all terms and
conditions of employment of the applicable Labor Contract on the Closing Date,
including wages, benefits, severance protection (if any), provision of
pension, health and other benefit plans, vacation, leave, hours or work and
other terms and conditions of employment in effect with respect to such
Employee on the Closing Date, and honor and fulfill all applicable obligations
under the applicable Labor Contract in respect to such Employee, except as the
same may be modified consistent with applicable Law or National Law.

  

  

(iii) Effect. This Section 5.9(c) shall supersede any contrary provisions of
Section 5.9(a).

  

  

(d) Non-U.S. Employee Communications. Each party to this Agreement shall
comply with all obligations under applicable National Laws to provide

Non-U.S. Employees or their representatives.

  

  

(e) Indemnification. Purchaser shall indemnify Chemtura and its Affiliates
against all Losses arising out of or in connection with (i) the employment of
the Transferred U.S. Employees and the Transferred Non-U.S. Employees with
Purchaser or its Affiliates; or (ii) any claim by an Employee in connection
with such Employee's employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates (whether in
contract or in tort or under statute for any remedy including for breach of
contract, unfair dismissal, redundancy, statutory redundancy, equal pay, sex,
race or disability discrimination, unlawful deductions from wages or for
breach of statutory duty or of any nature). Furthermore, Purchaser
acknowledges that its, its Affiliates', and its or their plans' (e.g.,
Purchaser U.S. Pension Plan) assumption of the Liabilities specified in this
Section 5.9, the transfer of the Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans and
Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans and the elimination of Chemtura's and its
Affiliates' responsibility for OPEB Benefits to the extent to be provided by
Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.9 is an essential part
of the consideration for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, Purchaser shall indemnify Chemtura and its Affiliates against all
Losses arising out of or in connection with the failure of Purchaser, an
Affiliate, or any plan of Purchaser or an Affiliate to satisfy, timely and in
full, (A) all such Liabilities, (B) any Liabilities arising out of or in
connection with the Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans or Transferred Foreign
Benefit Plans, (C) any wind-up Liability incurred in respect of Sellers'
Foreign Retirement Plans occasioned by actions, events or conditions occurring
or arising after Closing in respect of Purchaser's Foreign Retirement Plans
and (D) any Liabilities for the provision of OPEB Benefits occasioned by
reason of the failure of Purchaser and its Affiliates to provide at any time
after Closing OPEB Benefits to the extent and on the terms and conditions set
out in this Section 5.9. For avoidance of doubt any claims for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall be governed by the administrative
provisions set forth in Section 8.3.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Temporary, Etc. Employees. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take
reasonable steps to enter into an agreement with the provider of subcontracted
employees to the Business described in Section 5.9(f) of the Disclosure
Schedules to enable the transfer of such subcontracted employees from the
related contract of the Employee Transferors to a contract of Purchaser as of
the Closing Date. Sellers will cooperate with Purchaser to affect this
transfer.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Purchaser shall have no obligation for, or assume any
Liabilities with respect to, any Former Employees, whether with respect to the
United States Business or Non-United States Business, other than (i) any such
Former Employee of a Transferred Entity and (ii) in respect of any Transferred
U.S. Benefit Plan and any Transferred Foreign Benefit Plan. In addition, to
the extent Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser elects, in its sole
discretion, not to offer employment to any Employee who would otherwise be
required to be offered employment by Purchaser or an Affiliate pursuant to
Section 5.9(a)(i) or Section 5.9(b)(i), and such Employee is terminated by
Chemtura (or one of its Affiliates) in connection with the Closing, Purchaser
shall be responsible for (x) the severance benefit (if any) payable to such
terminated Employee under applicable Law and under the terms of the applicable
Employee Transferor's severance plan(s) in effect on the Closing Date and (y)
all costs (including legal expenses), fine or penalties associated with any
claim made by such Employee or otherwise in connection with the Employee's
termination of employment.

be settled; provided that this sentence shall not apply to any trade accounts
payable or trade accounts receivable (solely to the extent such trade accounts
payable and trade accounts receivable are taken into account and reflected in
the Closing Working Capital). Prior to Closing, Sellers may (but are not
required to) cause any amounts owed to or by any Seller related to the
Business or any Transferred Entity, on the one hand, from or to any other
Transferred Entity, on the other hand, to be settled.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60

transactions between Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities), on the one hand, and the Transferred Entities, on the other hand,
as set forth on Section 3.22 of the Disclosure Schedules or with respect to
which there could be further or continuing Liability or obligation on the part
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities
after the Closing), other than the Transition Services Agreement and the

terminated prior to the Closing without any further or continuing Liability on

its Affiliates have no active participation in the business of such
corporation or (ii) acquiring any Person or business that engages in a
Competing Business; provided that (A) (1) the Competing Business constitutes

acquisition of such Person or business) and (2) the revenues of such Competing
Business do not increase by more than 7.5% annually or (B) if the Competing

the portion that engages in the Competing Business in accordance with
subsection (ii)(B) above (whether through stock sale, asset sale, merger or
otherwise), then Chemtura or its applicable Affiliates (as the case may be)
shall discuss in good faith with Purchaser selling such Competing Business to
Purchaser.

directly or indirectly, target, solicit for employment or employ any
Transferred U.S. Employee or Transferred Non-U.S. Employee whose annual base
salary exceeds $100,000 (or the equivalent thereof) (the "Purchaser Restricted

Affiliates from targeting, soliciting for employment or employing any Seller
Restricted Employee (A) who responds to a general solicitation or

entities have not been specifically instructed by such Person to solicit
Seller Restricted Employees, (C) who contacts Purchaser or its Affiliates on
his or her own initiative, or (D) who is no longer employed by Seller or any
of its Affiliates and has not been employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates
during the three-month period immediately prior to the time of Purchaser's or
its Affiliate's, as the case may be, first contact with such Seller Restricted
Employee regarding future employment, and provided that such Seller Restricted
Employee has not terminated his or her employment with Seller or its Affiliate
at the encouragement of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained in this Section
5.11 (the "Restrictive Covenants"), a court shall hold that the duration,
scope or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances
then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area
restrictions reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the
stated duration, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed and
directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum
period, scope and area permitted by law. Sellers have determined and hereby
acknowledge that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in terms of
duration, scope and area restrictions and are necessary to protect the
goodwill of the Business and the substantial investment in the Business made
by Purchaser and hereunder. Each Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, further acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are
being entered into by it in connection with the sale by it and the Sellers of
the Business and the goodwill of the Business pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(f) If a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a
breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, Purchaser shall have the right to
an injunction or injunctions in the manner provided in Section 9.8 hereof,
which right and remedy shall be independent of the others and severally
enforceable, and which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights
and remedies available to Purchaser at law or in equity.

  

  

(g) In the event of any breach or violation by a Seller or any of its
Affiliates of any of the Restrictive Covenants in Section 5.11(a), the
expiration of such covenant shall be extended to the date that is three years
after the Closing Date, plus the number of days from the date on which Seller
is notified in writing of the alleged breach or violation until the earlier of
(i) the date on which such breach or violation ceases and (ii) the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that it is determined in a final,
non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction that Seller of
one of its Affiliates (as applicable) has violated or breached such
Restrictive Covenants.

  

  

Section 5.12. Payments Received. Chemtura and Purchaser agree that, after the
Closing Date, they shall hold and shall promptly transfer and deliver to the
other party, from time to time as and when received by it and in the currency
received, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using commercially
reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash), or other property
that they may receive after the Closing Date which property belongs to the
other party, including any payments of accounts receivable and insurance
proceeds, and shall account to the other party for all such receipts. In the
event of a dispute between the parties regarding any party's obligations under
this Section 5.11(e), the parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to
promptly resolve such dispute and, in connection with such cooperation, allow
each other reasonable access to the records of the other relating to such
disputed item.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.13. Sellers' Marks. Except as expressly set forth herein, each of
Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, successors, assigns, agents, or
representatives shall not register or own, or attempt to register or own, and
shall not directly or indirectly use, in any fashion, including in signage,
corporate letterhead, business cards, internet websites, marketing material
and the like, or seek to register or own, in connection with any products or
services anywhere in the world in any medium, any (a) Intellectual Property
that includes, is identical to, is confusingly similar to, or is a derivation
of any of the trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, trade
dress, trade styles or other indicia of origin set forth on Section 5.13 of
the Disclosure Schedules (the "Sellers' Marks") either alone or in
combinations or (b) any other Excluded Intellectual Property, nor shall any of
them challenge or assist any third party in opposing the rights of Chemtura
anywhere in the world in, or with respect to, any such Intellectual Property.
As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Purchaser shall take all steps
necessary to (i) change the registered and business names of the Transferred
Entities, (ii) re-register products under a new business name with the
applicable Governmental Authority and (iii) cease all use of any of the
Sellers' Marks, provided, however, that subject to the restrictions set forth
herein, Chemtura hereby extends to Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date,
a personal, nonexclusive, royalty-free transition license for fifteen months
after the Closing Date to continue to use the Sellers' Marks: (x) on existing
signage, marketing materials and other materials, in each case included in the
Transferred Assets as of the Closing Date, (y) in the Transferred Inventory
and (z) for the Transferred Entities. No new use of Sellers' Marks shall be
made by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall in any event transition away from all
use of Sellers' Marks as soon as is reasonably practicable, after the Closing
Date. If after the license granted pursuant to this Section 5.13 expires
Purchaser still possesses signage, symbols, and marks bearing the Sellers'
Marks, Purchaser shall affix labels to such signage, symbols, and marks that
cover the Sellers' Marks, to the extent possible. All use of Sellers' Marks as
permitted hereunder shall inure solely to the benefit of Chemtura. Purchaser
shall incur all costs associated with the re-branding of the Transferred
Inventory or the Transferred Entities, including, but not limited to, costs
associated with transitioning signage, symbols and marks to signage, symbols
and marks not constituting Excluded Intellectual Property during the term, and
after the expiration, of the license granted under this Section 5.13.

  

  

Section 5.14. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Indemnity. From and after the Closing, Chemtura agrees to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against, and to pay and hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties harmless from, all Losses arising out of (i) any Taxes of
or payable by any Transferred Entity or with respect to the Business or the
Transferred Assets, in each case, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including, without limitation, any such pre-Closing Taxes arising from any
breach of Section 3.7 hereof, which Taxes shall be governed exclusively by
this Section 5.14), (ii) any Liability of any Transferred Entity for the Taxes
of any Person that is or was a member of a Seller Tax Group (other than
another Transferred Entity) pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury
Regulations (or comparable provision under any other applicable Law) by reason
of being affiliated with such Person prior to the Closing, (iii) any Taxes
attributable to any failure by Chemtura or any of the Sellers to perform or
comply with any covenant in this Agreement relating to Taxes, (iv) any and all
(A) income, franchise or similar Taxes of Sellers or any of their Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Entities) for any taxable period or (B) Taxes of
Sellers not arising out of the Business (including Taxes arising out of the
Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets) for any taxable period; and (v) any
Transfer Taxes or VAT that are Chemtura's responsibility pursuant to Sections
5.8(a) or 5.8(b); provided that Chemtura shall have no obligation to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against, or pay or hold the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties harmless from, any Losses described in this Section
5.14(a) to the extent such Losses are reflected as a liability in the Closing
Adjustments Schedule. Purchaser agrees to indemnify Chemtura against, and to
pay and hold Chemtura harmless from, any and all Losses arising out of (i) any
Taxes of or payable by any Transferred Entity, or with respect to the Business
or the Transferred Assets, in each case other than any such Taxes for which
Chemtura is required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant
to the previous sentence, and (ii) Transfer Taxes or VAT that are the
responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to Sections 5.8(a) or 5.8(b)).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Tax Returns. Sellers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed all Tax Returns (i) of Sellers that include the Business or the
Transferred Assets for all taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) of any Transferred Entity for any taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (iii) that are Consolidated
Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be timely prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Tax
Law and filed at Sellers' expense (taking into account any extension of a
required filing date), and all Taxes shown as due thereon will be timely paid
by Sellers. Other than in respect of a Consolidated Tax Return, (x) 30 days
prior to filing any income Tax Return with respect to any Straddle Period and
(y) ten days prior to the filing of a non-income Tax Return with respect to
any Straddle Period, Sellers shall deliver a draft thereof to Purchaser for
Purchaser's review and comment. Purchaser shall have ten Business Days to
provide Chemtura with a statement of any disputed items with respect to such
Tax Return. If the disputed items are not resolved by Chemtura and Purchaser
within five days following Purchaser's submission of its statement of disputed
items, the matter shall be submitted to the Accountant who shall be directed
to, within ten days after such submission, render a decision with respect to
all matters in dispute, and such decision shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. The fees and disbursements of such
accounting firm shall be shared equally by Chemtura and Purchaser. Purchaser
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed with respect to the Business, the
Transferred Assets or the Transferred Entities. At least (x) 30 days prior to
filing any income Tax Return with respect to any Straddle Period and (y) ten
days prior to the filing of a non-income Tax Return with respect to any
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall deliver a draft thereof to Chemtura for
Chemtura's review and comment. Chemtura shall have ten Business Days to
provide Purchaser with a statement of any disputed items with respect to such
Tax Return. If the disputed items are not resolved by Chemtura and Purchaser
within five days following Chemtura's submission of its statement of disputed
items, the matter shall be submitted to the Accountant who shall be directed
to, within ten days after such submission, render a decision with respect to
all matters in dispute, and such decision shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. The fees and disbursements of such
accounting firm shall be shared equally by Chemtura and Purchaser. Purchaser
shall not file or cause or permit any Transferred Entity to file any amended
Tax Return after the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of Chemtura, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if such amendment is required by
applicable Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Allocation of Taxes. For purposes of this Section 5.14, in the case of any
Straddle Period, the amount of any (i) Taxes based on or measured by income or
receipts of the Transferred Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii)
all other Taxes that otherwise can be reasonably allocated to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of any Taxes of the
Transferred Entities for a Straddle Period to be attributed to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period that is not susceptible to allocation based on the methodology
described in the preceding sentence shall be determined by multiplying the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. Any credits (including prepayments and deposits of Taxes) relating to
a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though such Straddle Period
ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Transferred Entities and the Sellers.

  

  

(d) Group Tax Returns. With respect to a Transferred Entity that is a member
of a Seller Tax Group for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, Chemtura, other Sellers or their Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Entities) (i) may, if permitted by applicable Law, use
any of their losses, credits or other tax attributes to reduce the Tax
liability of the Transferred Entity for taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) may, if permitted by applicable
Law, use any losses, credits or other tax attributes of the Transferred Entity
arising in a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date to reduce their own Tax liability and shall not be required to
compensate the Transferred Entity or Purchaser for any such losses, credits or
other tax attributes.

  

  

(e) Refunds. Any overpayments, refunds or credits of, Taxes attributable to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Transferred Entities (including in respect of a
Straddle Period), and any other Taxes for which Chemtura is responsible
pursuant to Section 5.14(a) to the extent not taken into account in the
Closing Adjustments Schedule, plus any interest actually received with respect
thereto from an applicable Taxing Authority (and including refunds or credits
in respect of such Taxes arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after
the Closing Date), shall be for the account of Chemtura. Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid such amount to Chemtura less reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such refunds less any Taxes
incurred by Purchaser or any Transferred Entity as a result of such refunds or
credits (including interest thereon). Purchaser shall, if reasonably requested
by Chemtura and solely at Chemtura's cost, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to file for, or cause to be filed for, and to obtain the receipt of,
any refund to which Chemtura is entitled under this Section 5.14(e).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) Settlement of Deficiencies and Adjustments. If any Tax Claim shall be made
by any Taxing Authority on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify
Chemtura in writing of such Tax Claim within 15 Business Days after receipt of
such Tax Claim. If Purchaser does not give notice of a Tax Claim to Chemtura
within such period or in detail sufficient to apprise Chemtura of the nature
of the Tax Claim, Chemtura shall not be liable to Purchaser to the extent that
Chemtura's position is prejudiced as a result thereof. Chemtura shall control
all proceedings in connection with any Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel) related to a Consolidated Tax Return and, without limiting the
foregoing, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect
thereto, and may either pay the Tax Claim and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest such Tax Claim in any
permissible manner. With respect to any Tax Claim (or proceeding arising
therefrom) relating exclusively to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion
of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (other than any such claim or
proceeding related to a Consolidated Tax Return), Chemtura shall control all
proceedings in connection with any such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forgo any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing
Authority with respect thereto, and may either pay the Tax Claim and sue for a
refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest such Tax
Claim in any permissible manner; provided that Chemtura shall keep Purchaser
regularly informed as to the status of such proceedings (including by
providing copies of all notices received from the relevant Taxing Authority)
and Purchaser shall have the right to review and comment on any correspondence
from Chemtura to the relevant Taxing Authority prior to submission of such
correspondence to such Taxing Authority, provided that Chemtura may not settle
or compromise any Tax Claim without the consent of the Purchaser, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such settlement or
compromise will adversely affect the Purchaser or any Transferred Entity after
the Closing Date in any material respect. With respect to any Tax Claim that
relates to a Straddle Period and could give rise to Tax some but not all of
which is subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 5.14(a), Purchaser and
Chemtura shall jointly control and participate in any proceedings in
connection with any such Tax Claim and shall keep the other party reasonably
informed as to the status of such proceedings (including by providing copies
of all notices received from the relevant Taxing Authority), provided that (i)
Chemtura and Purchaser shall bear their own respective costs and expenses in
connection with any such proceedings and (ii) neither Chemtura nor Purchaser
shall settle or compromise such Tax Claim without the other's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  

  

(g) Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Sellers and Purchaser shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended return
or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund of
Taxes or in conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant Tax
Returns, together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers,
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities
and records concerning the ownership and tax basis of property, which either
party may possess. Each party shall make its employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanation of any documents or information
provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be
required to prepare any documents (except tax data packages referred to
below), or determine any information not then in its possession, in response
to a request under this Section 5.14(g). Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other
for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing any return,
document or other written information, and shall compensate the other for any
reasonable costs (excluding wages and salaries) of making employees available,
upon receipt of reasonable documentation of such costs. Each party will retain
and maintain all returns, schedules and workpapers and all material records,
computer software and data maintained there under, or other documents relating
thereto, until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including
extensions) of the taxable years to which such returns and other documents
relate and, unless such returns and other documents are offered to the other
party, until the final determination of any payments which may be required in
respect of such years under this Agreement and to give the other party
reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such
book and records or computer software and data maintained there under, and, if
the other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records or computer software and data maintained thereunder.
Any information obtained under this Section 5.14(g) shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of returns or claims for refund or in conducting any audit or other
proceeding. Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall fully and accurately
complete and submit any tax data packages required by Sellers within the time
periods established by the tax department of Chemtura consistent with past
practices, provided that Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall be
entitled to reimbursement by the Sellers for reasonable incremental out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in the preparation of such data packages.
Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

(h) Termination of Prior Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax sharing agreements,
whether or not written, to which any Seller and a Transferred Entity are
parties shall be terminated at or prior to the Closing. After such time such
Transferred Entity shall have no further rights or obligations thereunder, and
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern the rights and obligations of
Sellers, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities to make or receive payments
with respect to Taxes or refunds of Taxes of the Transferred Entities. Sellers
shall execute (and shall cause the Transferred Entities to execute) any
documents that may be reasonably required to evidence agreement with this
Section 5.14(h).

  

  

(i) Code Section 338(g) Elections. Purchaser may at its option make any
election under Code Section 338(g) with respect to the purchase of any
Transferred Entity.

  

  

(j) Post-Closing Transactions. Purchaser shall not cause or permit any
Transferred Entity to engage in any transaction during the period after the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2014 (the "Short Period") which will
cause Chemtura to realize any United States federal or state income tax,
without the prior written consent of Chemtura, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld by Chemtura, so long as Purchaser indemnifies Chemtura
for any such tax as a result of such transaction. Transactions during the
Short Period that could impact Chemtura and cause Chemtura to realize United
States federal or state income taxes include a distribution of earnings by a
Transferred Entity to Purchaser, its Affiliates or another Transferred Entity,
an election to change the classification of any Transferred Entity and/or any
transaction that would reduce the amount of Chemtura's "Section 1248 amount."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

(k) To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 5.14 and Article
VIII, this Section 5.14 shall control as to Tax matters provided that the
limitations set forth in Section 8.4(a)(iv) shall apply to Chemtura's
obligations under Section 5.14(a).

  

  

Section 5.15. Bulk Sales Laws. Chemtura and Purchaser each hereby waive
compliance by Chemtura with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk
transfer" or similar Laws of any state.

  

  

Section 5.16. Credit and Performance Support Obligations. Purchaser agrees to
take commercially reasonable efforts to cause Sellers and their Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Entities) to be absolutely and unconditionally
relieved, on or prior to the Closing Date, of all Liabilities arising out of
the letters of credit, performance bonds, corporate guarantees and other
similar items issued and outstanding in connection with the Business and set
forth on Section 5.16 of the Disclosure Schedules (collectively, "Credit
Support Obligations"). To the extent Sellers and their Affiliates are not
absolutely and unconditionally relieved of all such Liabilities on or prior to
the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees (a) to continue after the Closing to take
commercially reasonable efforts to absolutely and unconditionally relieve
Sellers and their Affiliates of all such Liabilities and (b) with respect to
any Credit Support Obligation for which Purchaser has not obtained an absolute
and unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates by the Closing Date
(each such Credit Support Obligation, until such time as such Credit Support
Obligation is released in accordance with this Section 5.16, a "Continuing
Credit Support Obligation"), to indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates for any
demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Credit Support
Obligation or any cash or other collateral posted by Sellers or their
Affiliates in connection with or in the place of any such Continuing Credit
Support Obligation and for the carrying costs of any cash collateral not
replaced by Purchaser, the fronting fee costs, and any other out-of-pocket
third party costs and expenses resulting from each such Continuing Credit
Support Obligation.

  

  

Section 5.17. Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII hereof (the "Exclusive Period"), no Seller shall
and it shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, through any
representative or other agent, take any action to solicit, initiate, seek,
entertain, encourage or accept any inquiry, proposal or offer from, furnish
any information to, or participate in any discussions or negotiations with,
any third party (other than Purchaser) regarding any Third Party Acquisition.
Each Seller agrees that any such discussions or negotiations (other than
negotiations with Purchaser) in progress as of the date of this Agreement will
be immediately terminated and that in no event will a Seller accept or enter
into an agreement concerning any Third Party Acquisition during the Exclusive
Period.

  

  

Section 5.18. Actions with Respect to Financing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including by using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on
terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Purchaser, taken
as a whole (including with respect to the conditionality thereof), than the
terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter), (ii) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions
(including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any fee letter)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (any such agreements, the "Debt
Financing Agreements"), (iii) ensure the accuracy of all representations and
warranties of Purchaser set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt
Financing Agreements, (iv) comply with all covenants and agreements of
Purchaser set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing
Agreements, (v) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the
Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing
Agreements, and (vi) upon satisfaction of such conditions and the other
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 and (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, subject to
the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), consummate the Debt Financing
at or prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the Termination Date).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser shall
have no obligation to formally seek to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreement (including any obligation to
file suit against the lenders thereunder).

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall promptly inform Chemtura in reasonable detail regarding
all material activity and timing considerations concerning the Debt Financing,
including any material adverse change with respect to the Debt Financing.
Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to notify Chemtura promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the
Closing Date (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is terminated for any reason, (ii)
Purchaser becomes aware of any material breach or default by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreements, (iii) a counterparty
indicates in writing or orally that it will not provide, or it refuses to
provide, all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein, (iii) Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates or any other Loan Party (as defined in the Purchaser Credit
Agreement) notifies the Administrative Agent and any Lender (each as defined
in the Purchaser Credit Agreement) that an officer of a Loan Party has
obtained knowledge of (x) the occurrence of any Default (as defined in the
Purchaser Credit Agreement), or (y) any matter that has a resulted or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
the Purchaser Credit Agreement), and (iv) Purchaser receives any communication
from the Administrative Agent or any Lender (each as defined in the Purchaser
Credit Agreement) that relates in any respect to Purchaser's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, if Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or any Loan Party delivers any
Compliance Certificate (as defined in the Purchaser Credit Agreement) to the
Administrative Agent (as defined in the Purchaser Credit Agreement), Purchaser
shall cause a true and complete copy of such Compliance Certificate to be
promptly (and in any event within one Business Day following delivery to the
Administrative Agent) delivered to Chemtura. Purchaser shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of Sellers,
take any action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably be
expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any portion of the
Debt Financing including, without limitation, creating, incurring, assuming or
guaranteeing any Indebtedness, other than pursuant to the Dollar Revolving
Credit Facility (as defined in the Purchaser Credit Agreement) or the
Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in the Purchaser Credit
Agreement), in each case, in the Ordinary Course of Business. Without the
prior written consent of Sellers, Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt
Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification, joinder, termination or
waiver (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on
the Closing, (B) expand upon in any material respect the conditions precedent
or contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of the Debt Financing as
set forth in the Financial Letters, or (C) prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser
shall promptly deliver to Sellers copies of any amendment, modification,
waiver, joinder, termination or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Debt Financing Agreements, provided, that the amount of fees, "market
flex" provisions, pricing terms and pricing caps set forth in any fee letters
delivered to Sellers may be redacted in a customary manner.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) Purchaser
shall have the right to substitute other debt or equity financing for all or
any portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative financing
sources, and (ii) if any portion or all of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to promptly
obtain such Debt Financing from alternative sources, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), on terms not less favorable to Purchaser (including with
respect to the conditionality thereof) and which would not have any of the
effects described in clauses (A)-(D) of Section 5.18(b), in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing that is available
to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Alternative Financing"),
and, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), Purchaser shall obtain a new
financing commitment letter (the "Alternative Commitment Letter") and a new
definitive agreement with respect thereto (the "Alternative Financing
Agreement"). In such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 5.18(c)) shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Financing, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" as used in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 5.18(c)) shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Commitment Letter, and the term "Debt Financing Agreement" as used
in this Agreement (other than in this Section 5.18(c)) shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Financing Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Seller
Related Party (other than Purchaser) shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing,
the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any Seller
Related Party (other than Purchaser) in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or

Section 5.19. Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser all reasonable cooperation
reasonably requested by Purchaser that is necessary in connection with the
Debt Financing, including (x) using reasonable best efforts to (a)
participate, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, in a reasonable
number of meetings (including customary meetings with the parties acting as
lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Debt Financing), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt
Financing, (b) assist Purchaser and its Financing Sources in the preparation
of customary offering memoranda, bank information memoranda, rating agency
presentations and lender presentations relating to the Debt Financing, (c)
cooperate with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and its Financing Sources
for all or any portion of the Debt Financing, (d) provide and execute
documents as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or its Financing
Sources, (e) execute and deliver any pledge and security documents and
otherwise facilitate the pledging of collateral, and (f) provide such
information about powers of attorney executed on behalf of the Transferred
Entities as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or its Financing Sources,
and (y) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist in obtaining
accountant\'s comfort letters and legal opinions reasonably requested by
Purchaser and customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing;
provided, however, that, (i) irrespective of the above, no obligation of the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates under any certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Closing and none of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates shall be required to take or commit to take any action
under any certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the
Closing (including the entry into any agreement that is effective before the
Closing) or that would be effective prior to the Closing, (ii) nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Sellers or their Affiliates or encumber
any assets of the Sellers or their Affiliates, and (iii) none of the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates shall be required to issue any offering or
information document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including the Alternative Financing contemplated by Section
5.18(c)), in no event shall Sellers or any of their Affiliates be obligated to
provide Purchaser with any cooperation that would not otherwise be necessary
in connection with the type of Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter entered into by Purchaser as of the date hereof and attached
as Exhibit C. None of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall be required
to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
make any other payment (unless such payment is promptly reimbursed by
Purchaser) or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing
or any of the foregoing prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 5.19) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Sellers or their Subsidiaries provided by the
Sellers in writing specifically for use in the Debt Financing offering
documents). Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the Sellers, reimburse
the Sellers for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel and other advisors) incurred
by the Sellers or their Affiliates in connection with this Section 5.19. The
Sellers hereby consent to the use of their and their Subsidiaries' logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos shall be used
solely in a manner customary for financing transactions of this type and in a
manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or
otherwise adversely affect the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the representations and warranties in
Section 3.5(a) shall be made mutatis mutandis with respect to the 2013 Audited
Financial Statements as if the 2013 Audited Financial Statements were the
Audited Financial Statements as of the date hereof, and (ii) the
representations and warranties in Section 3.5(b) shall be made mutatis
mutandis with respect to the 2013 Business Balance Sheet as if the 2013

Purchaser an unaudited balance sheet of the Business as held and conducted by
Chemtura and its Subsidiaries as of the Stub Financial Date, and the related
unaudited combined statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), net
parent investment and cash flows of the Business as held and conducted by
Chemtura and its Subsidiaries for the period commencing January 1, 2014 and
ending on the Stub Financial Date (the "Stub Period Financials"). The "Stub
Financial Date" shall mean June 30, 2014, provided however if the Closing has
not occurred by November 5, 2014, then the Stub Financial Date shall mean a
quarter end date that occurs no more than 135 days prior to the fourth

with respect to each Transferred Entity shall be the amount that is reasonably
required to provide for the ordinary course liquidity needs of such
Transferred Entity.

  

  

(b) In addition, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Purchaser
shall deliver to Chemtura its reasonable good faith determination of the
percentages to be set forth on Schedule H-2, and thereafter Chemtura and
Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to promptly prepare Schedule H-2. The
Retained Cash Repatriation Percentage with respect to each Transferred Entity
shall be the tax rate that would reasonably be expected to apply under current
Law in connection with the repatriation of cash held by such Transferred
Entity to the United States, using reasonable available means of minimizing
such tax rates. Purchaser shall provide Chemtura with reasonable supporting
documentation with respect to Purchaser\'s determinations, and Purchaser shall
cooperate with Chemtura as may be reasonably requested in connection with
Chemtura\'s review thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) If at any time after the date that is 60 days after the date hereof the
parties have not reached agreement with respect to the amounts to be set forth
on Schedule H-1 or Schedule H-2, each of Chemtura and Purchaser may elect to
cause the Accountant to be retained (in the manner and on the terms set forth
in Section 1.7(c)) to determine such amounts prior to Closing and such
determination shall be final.

  

  

Section 5.22. Brazilian Arrangements. The parties shall (a) prior to the
Closing Date, negotiate in good faith one or more agreements (i) providing for
the arrangements to be entered into by them or their respective Affiliates
(including, in the case of Purchaser from and after the Closing, Chemtura
Industria Quimica do Brasil Ltda.) at Closing (each, a "Brazilian Closing
Agreement") and (ii) providing for the arrangements to be entered into by them
or their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser from and
after the Closing, Chemtura Industria Quimica do Brasil Ltda.) after the
Closing Date, in each case reflecting the terms and conditions described in
Schedule I and (b) otherwise take the actions set forth in Schedule I hereto.

  

  

Section 5.23. Pre-Closing Transition Services. During the period from the date
hereof until the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement, Chemtura
shall, and shall cause the other Sellers and the Transferred Entities to,
cooperate with Purchaser as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser from time
to time (including Purchaser's reasonable requests to train Purchaser's
personnel) to prepare for the orderly transfer and transition of the Business,
on a standalone basis, to Purchaser at the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and Chemtura shall take the actions set
forth on Schedule J hereto. Further, Chemtura and Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that Chemtura and Purchaser are continuing to discuss and finalize the
schedules to the Transition Service Agreement, and that Purchaser shall have
the right to make additions, deletions and other changes to the schedules to
the Transition Services Agreement prior to the Closing Date to the same extent
as Purchaser would be permitted to make such additions, deletions and other
changes after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement.

herein, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated
hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Chemtura;

  

  

(b) by Purchaser by written notice to Chemtura, if the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated on or before November 1, 2014 (the
"Termination Date") unless such failure or incapacity to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Termination Date was primarily
attributable by Purchaser's breach of any covenant or agreement contained
herein;

  

  

(c) by Chemtura by written notice to Purchaser, if the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated on or before the Termination Date
unless such failure or incapacity to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby by the Termination Date was primarily attributable by Sellers' breach
of any covenant or agreement contained herein;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) by Purchaser by notice to Chemtura, if a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Chemtura set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition set forth in
Section 6.2 not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured
by the Termination Date; provided that Purchaser shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) if Purchaser is then
in breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that would cause any condition set forth in
Section 6.3 not to be satisfied; or

  

  

(e) by Chemtura by notice to Purchaser, if a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition set forth in
Section 6.3 not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured
by the Termination Date; provided that Chemtura shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if Chemtura is then
in breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that would cause any condition set forth in
Section 6.2 not to be satisfied.

  

  

(f) by the Chemtura if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but each of which is
capable at the time of termination of being satisfied), (ii) Chemtura has
notified Purchaser in writing that Chemtura is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing, and (iii) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing
within one Business Day following the date the Closing was required to be

Section 7.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect, and none of the parties hereto (nor their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, shareholders, officers, employees,
agents, consultants, attorneys in fact or other representatives) nor any
Financing Source shall have any liability in respect of such termination,
except, with respect to the parties hereto, as provided in this Section 7.2
and, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 7.3; provided that (a) no such
termination (nor any other provision of this Agreement) shall relieve any
party from liability for any damages for fraud or for willful breach of any
covenant hereunder, and (b) the provisions of this Section 7.2 and of Section

77  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 7.3. Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), and Purchaser's failure to consummate the Closing was solely
as a result of a Debt Financing Failure, Purchaser shall be obligated to pay
Chemtura, on behalf of Sellers, $49,700,000 in cash (the "Purchaser
Termination Fee"). If the Purchaser Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall pay to or at the direction of Chemtura the
Purchaser Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds no
later than five Business Days after the date of such termination (it being
understood that in no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Purchaser
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). If Purchaser fails to promptly pay
the Purchaser Termination Fee when due, interest shall accrue on such amount
from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement until the date of payment at a rate equal to the Prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, plus 500 basis points.
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed. If, in order to obtain such payment,
Chemtura commences a suit that results in judgment for Chemtura, Purchaser
shall pay Chemtura its (and Sellers') reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
suit. In the event that Chemtura has the right to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Purchaser Termination Fee as provided in the first sentence of
this Section 7.3, the right to terminate this Agreement and receive the
Purchaser Termination Fee, together with collecting any interest and other
amounts due under the preceding sentence of this Section 7.3 and any amounts
due under the indemnification and reimbursement obligations set forth in
Section 5.19, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Seller Related Parties
against Purchaser for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller
Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, and the Debt Commitment
Letter (and the termination hereof and thereof), the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or termination hereof and thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, and no Seller Related Party
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
Purchaser arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or
the abandonment or termination hereof or thereof) or any matters forming the
basis for such termination.

representations and warranties of the parties contained in Articles III and IV

terminate on March 31, 2016; provided that (a) the representations and
warranties in (i) Sections 3.1 (Due Organization), 3.2(a) (Authority), 3.3
(Transferred Entities; Title to Equity Interests) and 3.25 (Finder's Fees)
(the foregoing, collectively, "Sellers' Fundamental Representations"), and
(ii) Sections 4.1 (Corporate Status), 4.2 (Authority), 4.4 (Finder's Fees) and
4.8 (Capitalization) (the foregoing, collectively, "Purchaser's Fundamental
Representations") shall survive indefinitely. All covenants and agreements
contained herein, which by their terms contemplate performance following the
Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms; provided that (x) all covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement relating to Taxes shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect until thirty days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations for the relevant Taxes in question, (ii)
Chemtura's indemnification obligations under Sections 8.2(a)(iv) and 8.2(a)(v)
shall, in each case, expire on the date that is the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, (iii) Chemtura\'s indemnification obligations for the matters
set forth in Section 8.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedules shall expire on the
date specified in Section 8.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedules with respect to
the applicable matter, and (iv) Chemtura's indemnification obligations under
Sections 8.2(a)(vii) shall expire on the date that is the tenth anniversary of
the Closing Date. The period of time a representation or warranty or covenant
or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this 8.1 shall be the "Survival
Period" with respect to such representation or warranty or covenant or
agreement. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification under this
Article VIII shall have been given within the applicable Survival Period and
such claim has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival
Period, the representations or warranties or covenants or agreements that are
the subject of such claim shall survive, but only to the extent of and in the
amount of the claim as made prior to the expiration of the Survival Period,
until such claim is finally resolved.

Section 8.2. Indemnification. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
set forth in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing Date:

  

  

(a) Chemtura shall, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates

employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses that are imposed on or
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of or in connection
with (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Chemtura in
Article III, (ii) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Sellers
set forth in this Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Liabilities (other than in
respect of Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 5.14(a)),
(iv) the Pre-Closing Environmental Claims, (v) the Pre-Closing Products
Liabilities Claims, (vi) the matters set forth in Section 8.2(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules, or (vii) the Rio Claro Environmental Liabilities.

  

  

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and their
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, members,
partners, managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses that are imposed
on or incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in Article IV, (ii) any
failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) the Assumed Liabilities, or (iv) the conduct of the Business
acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and the ownership, use and
possession of the Transferred Assets, on or after the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 8.3. Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) Third-Party Claims.

  

  

(i) In order for a party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Article VIII (the "Indemnified Party") in respect of a claim made
against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the
indemnifying party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim; provided that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim, other than those notices and documents separately addressed
to the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnifiable hereunder and to select counsel of its choice; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall only be entitled to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim if the claim
does not relate to any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation brought against the Business or the Transferred Assets. If the
Indemnifying Party (i) does not within 20 Business Days of its receipt of
notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i) elect to defend
against or negotiate any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnifiable hereunder, or (ii) after assuming such control (A) does not
within 180 days of its receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to
Section 8.3(a)(i) acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Third-Party Claim or (B),
fails to diligently defend against such Third-Party Claim in good faith, then
the applicable Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at
its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, provided, however,
that if an actual conflict of interest makes representation of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel
inappropriate, then the Indemnified Party may, upon written notice to the
Indemnifying Party, engage separate counsel, and the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party to
the extent the Third Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder.

  

  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the applicable Indemnified
Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and make available
to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party is
defending or prosecuting such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
(and shall cause the applicable Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof and make available to the Indemnified Party, at
the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, no such Third-Party Claim may be settled, compromised or discharged by
the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless any such
settlement, compromise or discharge (i) obligates the Indemnifying Party (or
its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the Liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, (ii) imposes no injunctive or other equitable relief
against any Indemnified Party and (iii) unconditionally releases all
Indemnified Parties from all further liability in respect of such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, fails to acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Third-Party Claim within the
time period set forth in Section 8.3(a)(ii) or fails to diligently defend
against such Third-Party Claim in good faith the Indemnified Parties may
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim in its sole
discretion.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

(iv) Any Third-Party Claim relating to Taxes shall be governed by Section
5.14(f).

  

  

(b) Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII that does not involve a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to
the Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware
of the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party under this Article VIII, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such
failure.

  

  

(c) Trade Accounts Payable. In the event that Chemtura or any of its
Affiliates pays, on or after the Closing Date, any account payable that
constitutes an Assumed Liability or any account payable of any Transferred
Entity, Chemtura or its Affiliate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to be
reimbursed by Purchaser in full for such payment. Chemtura or its Affiliate,
as the case may be, may deliver notice claiming reimbursement, together
reasonable supporting documentation that such payment was made, to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall, within five Business Days of receiving such notice,
reimburse Chemtura or its Affiliate in full for such payment. In the event
that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pays, on or after the Closing Date,
any account payable that constitutes an Excluded Liability, Purchaser or its
Affiliate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Sellers
in full for such payment. Purchaser or its Affiliate, as the case may be, may
deliver notice claiming reimbursement, together reasonable supporting
documentation that such payment was made, to Chemtura, and Chemtura shall,
within five Business Days of receiving such notice, reimburse Purchaser or its
Affiliate in full for such payment.

  

  

(d) Notification. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party with respect to any claim as to which
indemnification is sought hereunder even though the amount thereof plus the
amount of other claims previously notified by the Indemnified Party in
aggregate is less than the Threshold Amount.

  

  

Section 8.4. Indemnification Limitations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) In no event shall Chemtura be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to Sellers' Fundamental
Representations) or Section 8.2(a)(vi) unless and until the aggregate amount
of all Losses with respect to Section 8.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to
Sellers' Fundamental Representations) or Section 8.2(a)(vi) that are imposed
on or incurred by Purchaser exceeds 1.5% of the Aggregate Purchase Price (the
"Threshold Amount"), in which case Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification only for such Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Chemtura shall not be liable for
indemnification with respect to any Loss by an Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i), Section 8.2(a)(iv), Section 8.2(a)(v), or Section
8.2(a)(vi) of less than $225,000 with respect to a claim (each, a "De Minimis
Loss") and all such Losses shall be disregarded and shall not be aggregated
for purposes of the Threshold Amount (it being understood and agreed that in
the event that a Loss is greater than the threshold for a De Minimis Loss, no
portion of such Loss shall be disregarded pursuant to this clause (i)), (ii)
Chemtura shall not be required to make payments for indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to Sellers' Fundamental
Representations) or Section 8.2(a)(vi) in an aggregate amount in excess of 10%
of the Aggregate Purchase Price, (iii) Chemtura shall not be required to make
payments for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iv) and Section
8.2(a)(v) in an aggregate amount in excess of 25% of the Aggregate Purchase
Price, and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Chemtura's liability
for Losses under this Agreement exceed the Aggregate Purchase Price. None of
the limitations set forth herein shall apply in the case of fraud or
intentional misrepresentations.

  

  

(b) In no event shall Purchaser be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2(b)(i) (other than with respect to Purchaser's Fundamental
Representations) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses with
respect to Section 8.2(b)(i) (other than with respect to Purchaser's
Fundamental Representations) that are imposed on or incurred by Sellers
exceeds 1.5% of the Stock Consideration (the "Purchaser Threshold Amount") in
which case Sellers shall be entitled to indemnification only for Losses in
excess of the Purchaser Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Purchaser shall not be liable for indemnification with respect to any De
Minimis Loss by an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) and all
such Losses shall be disregarded and shall not be aggregated for purposes of
the Purchaser Threshold Amount, (ii) Purchaser shall not be required to make
payments for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i) (other than with
respect to Purchaser's Fundamental Representations) in an aggregate amount in
excess of 10% of the Aggregate Purchase Price, and (iii) in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Purchaser's liability for Losses under this Agreement
exceed the Aggregate Purchase Price. None of the limitations set forth herein
shall apply in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentations.

  

  

(c) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the
amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of
any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any
other representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed
net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under
indemnification agreements or arrangements with third parties or under any
insurance policy with respect to such Losses (each, a "Collateral Source"),
net of costs of collection and/or increased premiums, (ii) any proceeds with
respect to such Losses that are transferred to Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.2(a)(xv), and (iii) any related reserves set forth in the Business Balance
Sheet and which reserves have been take into account and reflected in the
Closing Working Capital. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment
required under Article VIII is determined after payment of any amount
otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party under this Article VIII,
the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after
such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had
to pay pursuant to this Article VIII had such determination been made at the
time of such payment. In no event shall Chemtura be obligated to indemnify any
Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any matter to the extent that such
matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
an Indemnifying Party be liable for any punitive damages or any special,
incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind or nature,
regardless of the form of action through which such damages are sought, unless
such damages are recovered by a third party in a Third-Party Claim pursuant to
a final, non-appealable order entered against a Purchaser Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Purchaser from
seeking Losses based on a multiple of earnings to the extent such Losses
directly affect the earnings of the Business (to the extent not consequential
damages).

  

  

(e) Except with respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
after the Closing, except as provided in Section 9.8, indemnification pursuant
to the provisions of this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the parties from and after the Closing Date with respect to any and all
claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in respect of any
misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other provision
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

  

  

(f) All payments made pursuant to this Article VIII shall be deemed to be
adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

  

  

(g) For purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty has been
breached and the calculation of Losses pursuant to this Article VIII, the
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
(other than (i) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.5(c)
and Section 3.6, and (ii) any representations and warranties contained in the
first sentence of Section 3.12(a), the first sentence of Section 3.12(b), or
Section 3.13(a)), shall be interpreted without giving effect to any
limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the words
"material" and "materially" and the phrase "Business Material Adverse
Effect").

  

  

(h) Pre-Closing Environmental Claims.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Chemtura nor any Seller shall be required to indemnify or hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising out of or related to any
breach of any representations and warranties contained in Section 3.11
(Environmental Matters) or the indemnity contained in Section 8.2(a)(iv) or
(vii) to the extent (i) such Losses arise out of any invasive investigation of
environmental conditions conducted after the Closing Date by or on behalf of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, including testing or sampling, undertaken at the
Business Owned Real Property and Business Leased Real Property, or any
communication to any third party relating to environmental matters, unless
such investigation or communication is required under applicable Environmental
Laws or is in response to a request by a Governmental Authority, (ii) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or any of their representatives (A) remediate
environmental conditions in excess of industrial standards or other applicable
minimum standards, including risk-based standards, engineering and
institutional controls or deed or other restrictions, (B) incur costs in
excess of the minimum requirements of any Governmental Authority under
applicable Environmental Law, (C) close or sell any asset or facility or (D)
exacerbate any environmental condition existing as of the Closing Date or
(iii) such Losses arise from changes in an Environmental Law occurring after
the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, Chemtura
shall have the option to control any claim for indemnification arising under
Environmental Laws asserted by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, including
the disclosure, investigation, remediation, monitoring, negotiation,
performance, settlement and resolution of any such matter, provided that with
respect to any such claim involving the Business Owned Real Property or the
Business Leased Real Property, Chemtura shall keep Purchaser reasonably
informed of any such matter. If Chemtura opts to have Purchaser control any
claim for indemnification arising under Environmental Laws asserted by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, Purchaser shall keep Chemtura reasonably
informed of any such matter.

  

  

Section 8.5. No Rights of Offset. Purchaser waives and relinquishes any and
all rights to set off or to apply any monies held or indebtedness or other
obligations now or hereafter owing by Purchaser to Chemtura or any other
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates against any obligations of
Chemtura or any other Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument,
certificate or similar document required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, except to the extent the parties have agreed to an amount due or in
an amount equal to damages awarded pursuant to a final, non-appealable court
order.

  

  

Section 8.6. Tax Savings. To the extent a Loss that gives rise to an indemnity
payment under Section 5.14(a) or Section 8.2(a) results in a Tax benefit to
the Indemnified Party that is actually realized by it in the year of the Loss
or the six succeeding Tax periods, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the
applicable Indemnifying Party such Tax benefit (determined on a with and
without basis); provided that in no event shall the cumulative Tax benefit
remitted by the Indemnified Party exceed the amount of the applicable
indemnity payment and any such Tax benefit shall be deemed the last deduction
taken by the Indemnified Party in the applicable Tax year. If any such Tax
benefit is subsequently disallowed or rendered superfluous (e.g., because of a
carryback of losses into the taxable year in which such Tax Benefit was taken
into account), the applicable Indemnifying Party shall make an appropriate
reconciliation payment to the Indemnified Party.

Section 9.3. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any

extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.4. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
and the Transaction Documents, including all exhibits and schedules attached
hereto and thereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and supersede any and all other prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect

Agreement does not, and is not intended to, confer upon any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement any rights or remedies hereunder.

writing signed by all parties hereto. Any waiver of rights hereunder must be
set forth in writing. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not in any way affect, limit or

9.2, 9.5, 9.6, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.10 (and any other provision of this Agreement to
the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such
provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner that is adverse to any
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

  

  

Section 9.6. Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal
representatives and successors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement
shall not be assigned by any party hereto by operation of Law or otherwise
without the express written consent of each of the other parties, provided
that (i) prior to or after the Closing, Purchaser may assign its rights, in
whole or in part, to one or more of its controlled Affiliates and (ii) at or
after the Closing, Purchaser may assign this Agreement to the Lenders for
collateral security purposes, provided that in the case of the foregoing
clause (i) and (ii), no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its
obligations hereunder,. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of Sections 5.18(d), 7.2,

to be an admission or representation as to the materiality of the item so
disclosed. With respect to the Disclosure Schedules, any disclosure made on
any section or subsection thereof with respect to any representation or
warranty shall be deemed to be made with respect to any other representation
or warranty to which it relates to the extent that such relation is reasonably
apparent on its face.

  

  

Section 9.8. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for
any such failure to perform or breach of this Agreement. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law and the posting of any bond or other security in connection therewith.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent a party from seeking damages in the
event that specific performance is not available.

  

  

Section 9.9. Governing Law, etc. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the internal
laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws
rules thereof to the extent that the application of the law of another
jurisdiction would be required thereby.

  

  

Section 9.10. Submission to Jurisdiction. Purchaser and Sellers hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
New York and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the

subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any of such documents may not be
enforced in or by said courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in New York State or federal court. Purchaser and Seller hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of any such dispute and agree that mailing
of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 9.1, or in such other manner as may be
permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  

You have advised Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays") (the "Commitment Party," "we"
or "us"), that Platform Specialty Products Corporation ("PSP" or "you") either
directly or through its wholly-owned subsidiary MacDermid, Incorporated (the
"Borrower") or one of its other subsidiaries intends to acquire (the
"Acquisition") the "Chemtura AgroSolutions" business (including certain
subsidiaries of Chemtura Corporation) (collectively, the "Acquired Business")
from Chemtura Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Seller"), pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement (the "Acquisition
Agreement") and to consummate certain transactions described therein (as
described in Exhibit A, Exhibit B and as otherwise contemplated by this
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (each as defined below), the
"Transactions"), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Commitment Letter and Exhibits A, B and C (collectively, the
"Commitment Letter").

  

  

You have also advised us that the total cost of the Acquisition (and related
fees, commissions and expenses (collectively, "Transaction Costs")) after
consummation of the Acquisition will be financed from borrowings by the
Borrower of (i) $600 million of incremental first lien term loans (the "First
Lien Facility") incurred under and in accordance with Section 2.14 of the
amended and restated credit agreement dated as of June 7, 2013 (as amended,
restated and/or otherwise modified on October 31 2013 and from time to time,
the "Existing Credit Agreement") and as entered into among, inter alia, the
Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as
administrative agent and collateral agent, sole lead arranger and sole
bookrunner and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as syndication agent, and

Commitments and Agency Roles

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

You hereby appoint Barclays to act, and Barclays hereby agrees to act, as sole
and exclusive administrative agent and collateral agent (collectively in such
capacities, the "Administrative Agent") for each of the Facilities. You hereby
appoint Barclays to act, and Barclays hereby agrees to act, as sole lead
arranger and sole bookrunner (in such capacities, the "Arranger") for each of
the Facilities. The Arranger and the Administrative Agent will have the rights
and authority customarily given to financial institutions in such roles. In
such capacities we may, in our discretion and as reasonably acceptable to you,
appoint additional agents and co-agents in connection with the Facilities.
Barclays is pleased to hereby provide to you its commitment (the "Commitment")
to provide 100% of each of the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien
Facility, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter.

  

  

Our fees for services related to the Facilities are set forth in a separate
fee letter (the "Fee Letter") between you and us entered into on the date
hereof. As consideration for the execution and delivery of this Commitment
Letter by us, you agree to pay the fees and expenses set forth in Exhibits A
and B and in the Fee Letter as and when payable in accordance with the terms
hereof and thereof. You agree that no other titles will be awarded and no
compensation will be paid (other than as expressly contemplated by this
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter) in connection with the Facilities unless
you and we shall so agree; provided that on or before the close of business on
the date that is 10 Business Days from the date of this Commitment Letter you
may appoint up to one additional arranger that is reasonably satisfactory to
us and such additional arranger may be awarded the title of joint lead
arranger and joint book runner, so long as (i) Barclays shall have "left"
placement in any and all marketing materials or other documentation used in
connection with the Facilities and, with respect to the Facilities, Barclays
shall hold the leading role and responsibilities conventionally associated
with such "left" placement, (ii) such additional arranger (or its lending
affiliate) shall provide a commitment with respect to the Facilities
commensurate with its economics with respect thereto in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Barclays and (iii) Barclays shall be entitled to a pro rata
percentage of, but not less than 50% of the commitments and related economics
in respect of the Facilities.

Conditions Precedent

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Our commitments hereunder and our agreements to perform the services described
herein are subject to the following conditions: (i) since December 31, 2012,
there has not been a Business Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).
"Business Material Adverse Effect" means any change or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had a material adverse effect on the
assets, results of operations or financial condition of the Business, taken as
a whole; provided that changes or effects, alone or in combination, that arise
out of or result from the following, individually or in the aggregate, shall
not be considered when determining whether a Business Material Adverse Effect
has occurred: (a) changes in economic conditions, financial or securities
markets in general, including any changes in interest or exchange rates, or
the industries and markets (including with respect to commodity prices) in
which the Business is operated or in which products of the Business are used
or distributed, including increases in operating costs (except to the extent
such change has a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Business
as compared to other companies which operate in the same industries as the
Business), (b) any change in Laws, GAAP or any other generally accepted
accounting principles applicable to the Business, or the enforcement or
interpretation thereof, applicable to the Business (except to the extent such
change has a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Business as
compared to other companies which operate in the same industries as the
Business), (c) any change resulting from the negotiation, execution,
announcement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the
performance of obligations under, this Agreement, including any such change
relating to the identity of, or facts and circumstances relating to, Purchaser
or its Affiliates and including any actions by customers, suppliers or
personnel, (d) acts of God (including any hurricane, flood, tornado,
earthquake or other natural disaster or any other force majeure event),
calamities, national or international political or social conditions,
including acts of war, sabotage, the engagement by the United States in
hostilities, whether commenced before or after the date hereof, or the
occurrence of any military attack or terrorist act upon the United States or
any escalation or worsening of any of the foregoing, (e) the failure, in and
of itself, to achieve any projections, forecasts, estimates, performance
metrics or operating statistics (whether or not shared with Purchaser) (it
being understood that this clause (e) shall not exclude the facts or
circumstances giving rise to such failure to the extent such facts or
circumstances would otherwise constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect)
or (f) the taking of any action required by, or the failure to act to the
extent such action is specifically prohibited by, this Agreement or any
Transaction Document. Capitalized terms used in this clause (i) but not
defined herein are used with the meaning assigned to them in the Acquisition
Agreement and (ii) the conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit C. The
conditions to closing and initial funding of our commitments hereunder on the
Closing Date are limited to only those conditions set forth or referred to in
this paragraph.

Syndication

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The Arranger shall commence syndication of the Facilities to prospective
Lenders (as such term is defined in each of Exhibit A and B) promptly upon the
execution of this Commitment Letter and, in connection with its syndication of
the Facilities, the Arranger will select the Lenders after consultation with
you provided that we agree not to syndicate the commitment under the
Facilities or any portion thereof to certain banks, financial institutions and
other institutional, investors and funds that have been specified in writing
to the Commitment Party by you at any time prior to the date of delivery
hereof (or, if after such date but prior to the commencement of general
syndication, that are reasonably acceptable to the Commitment Party). The
Arranger will lead the syndication, including determining the timing of all
offers to prospective Lenders, any title of agent or similar designations or
roles awarded to any Lender and the acceptance of commitments, the amounts
offered and the compensation provided to each Lender from the amounts to be
paid to the Arranger pursuant to the terms of this Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letter, and will in consultation with you determine the final commitment
allocations and notify you of such determinations. You agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Arranger's syndication
efforts benefit from the existing lending and investment banking relationships
of you, the Borrower, the Acquired Business and your and their respective
subsidiaries. To ensure an orderly and successful syndication of the
Facilities, you agree that, until the date (the "Syndication Termination
Date") which is the earliest of (a) the termination by the Arranger of
syndication of the Facilities, (b) 60 days following the Closing Date and (c)
the "successful syndication" of the Facilities (as defined in the Fee Letter),
you will not, and agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the Acquired Business will not, syndicate or issue, attempt to syndicate or
issue, announce or authorize the announcement of the syndication or issuance
of, or engage in discussions concerning the syndication or issuance of, any
debt facility or any debt security of you, the Acquired Business or the
Borrower or any of your or their respective subsidiaries, including any
renewal or refinancing of any existing debt facility or debt security
(including the Existing Credit Agreement) in each case without the prior
written consent of the Arranger (other than the Facilities, indebtedness
permitted pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, and purchase money
indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations incurred in the ordinary course
of business).

  

  

You agree to, and agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Acquired Business to, cooperate with, and provide information reasonably
required by, the Arranger in connection with all syndication efforts,
including: (i) as soon as practicable after the date of this Commitment
Letter, assist in the preparation of a customary information memorandum and
other customary presentation materials (collectively, "Facilities Marketing
Materials") reasonably acceptable in form and content to the Arranger for use
in bank meetings and other communications with prospective Lenders in
connection with the syndication of the Facilities regarding the business,
operations, financial projections and prospects of you, the Borrower and the
Acquired Business and your and their respective subsidiaries, including
without limitation the delivery of all information relating to the
Transactions prepared by or on behalf of you, the Borrower or the Acquired
Business that the Arranger deems reasonably necessary to complete the
syndication of the Facilities; (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Standard and Poor's
Ratings Services, a Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC business ("SandP"),
prior to the launch of the general syndication, a corporate family rating from
Moody's, a corporate credit rating from SandP and a credit rating for each of
the Facilities from each of Moody's and SandP; (iii) arranging for direct
communications at reasonable times and places, using reasonable methods
(including telecommunications), with prospective Lenders, excluding
Disqualified Lenders, in connection with the syndication of the Facilities
(including without limitation direct contact between appropriate senior
management, representatives and advisors of you and the Borrower (and using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause direct contact with appropriate
senior management, representatives and advisors of the Acquired Business) and
participation of such persons in such meetings); and (iv) hosting (including
any preparations with respect thereto) with the Arranger at places and times
reasonably requested by the Arranger one or more conference calls with
prospective Lenders and, in connection with such conference calls, consulting
with the Arranger with respect to the presentations to be made and making
available appropriate senior management, representatives and advisors of you
and the Borrower to rehearse such presentations prior to such conference
calls, as reasonably requested by the Arranger. You agree that the Arranger
has the right to place advertisements in financial and other newspapers and
journals at their own expense describing their services to you; provided that
the Arranger will submit a copy of any such advertisement to you for your
prior written approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. You further agree that any references to the Arranger or any of its
affiliates made by you or your affiliates in advertisements or other marketing
materials used in connection with the Transactions are subject to the prior
written approval of the Arranger, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

You will be solely responsible for the contents of the Facilities Marketing
Materials and all other information, documentation or other materials
delivered to us in connection therewith and you acknowledge that we will be
using and relying upon such information without independent verification
thereof. You and the Borrower agree that such information regarding the
Facilities and information provided by you and the Borrower or your or its
representatives to the Arranger in connection with the Facilities (including,
without limitation, draft and execution versions of the Loan Documents,
information packages, presentations and publicly filed financial statements)
may be disseminated to prospective Lenders and other persons through one or
more Intranet sites (including an IntraLinks or Syndtrak workspace) created
for purposes of syndicating the Facilities or otherwise in accordance with the
Arranger's standard syndication practices (including hard copy and via
electronic transmissions) which shall contain standard confidentiality
undertakings.

  

  

You understand that certain prospective Lenders (such Lenders, "Public
Lenders") may have personnel that do not wish to receive MNPI (as defined
below). At the Arranger's request, you agree to prepare an additional version
of the Facilities Marketing Materials that does not contain material non-
public information concerning you, the Borrower, the Acquired Business or your
or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or your or their respective
securities for purposes of foreign and United States federal and state
securities laws (collectively, "MNPI") which is suitable to make available to
Public Lenders. You acknowledge and agree that the following documents may be
distributed to Public Lenders: (a) drafts and final versions of the Loan
Documents; (b) administrative materials prepared by the Arranger for
prospective Lenders (including without limitation a lender meeting invitation,
allocations and funding and closing memoranda); and (c) term sheets and
notification of changes in the terms and conditions of the Facilities. Before
distribution of any Facility Marketing Materials in connection with the
syndication of the Facilities (i) to prospective Lenders that are not Public
Lenders, you will provide us with a customary letter authorizing the
dissemination of such materials and (ii) to prospective and existing Public
Lenders, you will provide us with a customary letter authorizing the
dissemination of information that does not contain MNPI (the "Public
Information Materials") to Public Lenders and confirming the absence of MNPI
therein. In addition, at the Arranger's request, you will identify Public
Information Materials by marking the same as "PUBLIC" and you agree that
unless specifically labeled "PRIVATE -- CONTAINS NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION," no
information, documentation or other data disseminated to prospective Lenders
in connection with the syndication of the Facilities, whether through an
Internet site (including without limitation an IntraLinks or SyndTrak
workspace), electronically, in presentations, at meetings or otherwise will
contain MNPI.

Information

You represent and covenant that (i) all information (other than projections
and other forward-looking information and information of a general economic or
industry nature) that has been or will be provided to the Arranger, the
Commitment Party, the prospective Lenders or any of our or their respective
affiliates directly or indirectly by you or the Borrower or, to the best of
your knowledge, on behalf of the Acquired Business, in connection with the
Transactions is and will be, when furnished and taken as a whole, complete and
correct in all material respects and does not and will not, when furnished and
taken as a whole, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such
statements are made and (ii) the projections and other forward-looking
information that have been or will be made available directly or indirectly to
the Arranger, the Commitment Party, the prospective Lenders or any of our or
their respective affiliates by or on behalf of you or the Borrower and, to the
best of your knowledge, the Acquired Business, have been and will be prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions believed by management of the preparer
thereof to be reasonable when made and when initially made available to the
Arranger, the Commitment Party, the prospective Lenders and our or their
respective affiliates and on the Closing Date, it being understood and agreed
that financial projections are not a guarantee of financial performance and
actual results may differ from financial projections and such differences may
be material. You agree that if at any time prior to the Closing Date any of
the representations in the preceding sentence would be incorrect in any
material respect if the information and projections were being furnished, and
such representations were being made, at such time, then you will promptly
supplement, or cause to be supplemented, the information and projections so
that such representations will be correct in all material respects in light of
the circumstances in which statements are made. You understand that in
providing our services pursuant to this Commitment Letter we may use, rely on
and assume the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, accounting,
tax and other information and projections discussed with or reviewed by us for
such purposes, without independent verification thereof, and we do not assume
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

To induce us to enter into this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and to
provide the services described herein and proceed with the documentation of
the Facilities, you hereby agree to indemnify upon demand and hold harmless
the Administrative Agent and the Arranger and each other agent or co-agent (if
any) designated by the Arranger with respect to the Facilities and Barclays in
any other capacity to which it may be appointed by you in connection with the
Transactions, the Commitment Party and our and their respective affiliates and
each partner, trustee, shareholder, director, officer, employee, advisor,
representative, agent, attorney and controlling person thereof (each of the

proceedings (including any investigations or inquiries), claims, losses,
damages, liabilities or expenses (including all reasonable and documented fees
and disbursements of any law firm or other external counsel, but limited to
(i) one counsel to the Indemnified Persons taken as a whole, (ii) in the case
of any actual or reasonably perceived conflict of interest, additional counsel
to the affected Indemnified Persons or group of Indemnified Persons, limited
to one such additional counsel for each affected Indemnified Persons or group
of Indemnified Persons so long as representation of each such party by a
single counsel is consistent with and permitted by professional responsibility
rules, and (iii) if necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction
and special counsel for each relevant specialty) which may be incurred by or
asserted against or involve any Indemnified Person (whether or not any
Indemnified Person is a party to such action, suit, proceeding or claim) as a
result of or arising out of or in any way related to or resulting from the
Acquisition, this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Facilities, the
Transactions or any related transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any
use or intended use of the proceeds of the Facilities, including any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding), whether direct, indirect, or
consequential (whether or not we or any other Indemnified Person is a party
to, or you or the Borrower or any affiliate thereof initiated or is a party
to, any action, suit, proceeding or claim out of which any such expenses
arise); provided that you will not have to indemnify any Indemnified Person
against any claim, loss, damage, liability or expense to the extent the same
resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Person or the material breach by such Indemnified Person of its
obligations under this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the Facilities (in
each case, to the extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final and non-appealable judgment) or arises from any dispute between or among
any Indemnified Parties (other than any dispute against an Agent or Arranger)
and not involving any act or omission by the Borrower or any of its
affiliates. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Commitment Letter,
except to the extent any such damages result from the willful misconduct, bad
faith or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment, no
Indemnified Person will be responsible or liable to you or any other person or
entity for damages arising from the use by others of any information or other
materials obtained through internet, electronic, telecommunications or other
information transmission systems.

Facility (the "Facilities").

Concurrent Transactions: The proceeds from the borrowings made pursuant to the
Facilities on the Closing Date will be sufficient to consummate the
Acquisition, refinance all existing debt of the Acquired Business (other than
existing debt permitted to survive pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement) and pay the Transaction Costs. The terms of the Acquisition
Agreement (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and other attachments
thereto) and all related material documents (including transitional services
agreements) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Arranger; (it being
understood that the bid draft of the Acquisition Agreement dated as of April
16, 2014 and received by counsel to the Lead Arranger at 5:01 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time on April 16, 2014 is in form and substance satisfactory to the
Lead Arranger). The Acquisition shall have been consummated or will be
consummated concurrently with the initial funding under the Facilities in
accordance with the Acquisition Agreement; provided that no amendment,
modification or waiver of any term thereof or any condition to your or the
Borrower's obligation to consummate the Acquisition thereunder (other than any
such amendment, modification or waiver that is not materially adverse to any
interest of the Lenders) shall be made or granted, as the case may be, without
the prior written consent of the Arranger (it being understood that any change
in the price (including any price decrease) of the Acquisition of 10% or
greater will be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the
Lenders and will require the prior written consent of the Arranger, and any
such reduction of price shall be applied to the Facilities on a pro rata
basis).

Business, the representations made by or with respect to the Acquired Business
in the Acquisition Agreement that are material to the interests of the Lenders
and which the breach thereof will excuse PSP and Borrower (or any of their
affiliates) from their obligations to consummate the Acquisition shall be true
and correct as of the Closing Date (the "Acquired Business Representations");
and (b) with respect to representations relating to you, the Borrower and its
and your subsidiaries, the Specified Representations (as defined below) shall
be true and correct as of the Closing Date, it being understood and agreed
that the only representations the accuracy of which will be a condition
precedent to the availability of the Facilities on the Closing Date will be
the Acquired Business Representations and the Specified Representations. For
purposes hereof, "Specified Representations" means the representations and
warranties referred to or incorporated by reference in Exhibits A and B
relating to corporate existence and good standing, requisite power and
authority to enter into the Loan Documents, due authorization, execution,
delivery and enforceability of the Loan Documents (including the Existing
Credit Agreement and the Fee Letter); no conflicts of the Loan Documents with

(a) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective

6

(regardless of whether such sublicensees are expressly covered by such terms
and conditions), shall enforce such terms and conditions and the provisions of
any such sublicenses against its sublicensees, and shall remain responsible
and liable to the Party granting the License for the performance of any of its
sublicensees' obligations and for all acts or omissions of its sublicensees as
if they were acts or omissions of the Licensed Party under this Agreement. In
the case of the use restrictions of Sections 2.01 and 2.02, the written
agreement between the Licensed Party and the sublicensee will name the Party
granting the License as an express intended third-party beneficiary with a
right to directly enforce such provisions to the extent permitted under
applicable Law.

  

  

(b) If any sublicensee takes any action or omits to take any action that would
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement if such action or omission were or
were not taken by the Licensed Party, then the Licensed Party, upon becoming
aware of such action or omission: (i) shall immediately notify in writing the
Party granting the License thereof; (ii) upon written notice to the Licensed
Party from the Party granting the License, shall immediately address the
action or omission with sublicensee and consider terminating the relevant
sublicense to the extent it is permitted to do so under applicable Law; and

omission were or were not taken by the Licensed Party to the extent the
Licensed Party is permitted under applicable Law to prohibit such acts or
omissions.

under the Purchaser License and (y) Purchaser shall exclusively own all
improvements of any Purchaser Licensable IP conceived, made, reduced to

Improvements shall, if and to the extent they are within clause (ii) of the
definition of Purchaser Licensable IP, be automatically licensed to Chemtura
under the Chemtura License.

SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS LIMITING, RESTRICTING OR OTHERWISE PREJUDICING THE
RIGHTS OF THE PARTY GRANTING THE LICENSE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO SEEK AND
RECOVER ANY REMEDY (INCLUDING ANY AMOUNT OF DAMAGES) AGAINST OR OTHERWISE FROM
THE LICENSED PARTY IN AN ACTION AGAINST THE LICENSED PARTY FOR INFRINGEMENT,
MISAPPROPRIATION OR OTHER VIOLATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTY GRANTING SUCH

Agreement unless and until the assignee of such rights and obligations assumes
in writing all obligations of such Party under the Product Supply Agreement.
Any successor, transferee or assignee of a Party must agree in writing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and no assignment or
transfer of this Agreement by a Party shall relieve such Party of any of its

other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

or remedies provided by law.

Agreement may be executed simultaneously in one or more counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic .pdf submission), and by the different
Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same

Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party, this
Agreement shall have no effect and neither Party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer
any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

purchase certain assets used in the conduct of the Business (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) and assume certain liabilities relating to the Business,

Agreement;

and

  

  

WHEREAS, Purchaser acknowledges that Chemtura is not in the business of

certain reverse transition services from Purchaser to Chemtura, which are
expected to relate to transitional use of real estate.

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

"Chemtura's Cost" means, with respect to Chemtura's provision of any Service:

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

in the case of a Service or portion thereof provided by Chemtura to the

such Service;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

subject to Section 3.01(b), in the case of any Non-IT Service provided by
Chemtura to the Business, the cost to Chemtura of providing such Non-IT
Service, which shall be determined, if applicable, on the same basis and using
an equivalent methodology as used by Chemtura to allocate costs to the
Business for the year ended December 31, 2013 or, if not applicable, by mutual
agreement of the parties; provided that, with respect to each Non-IT Service
Category, the aggregate cost of the Non-IT Services in such Non-IT Service

such Non-IT Service Category for the year ended December 31, 2013; and

   
---|---|---

with respect to the IT Service Category for the year ended December 31, 2013;
provided, further, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
clause (iii), and without limiting Section 3.01(b), to the extent that the
actual cost to Chemtura of providing any IT Service exceeds (if applicable)
the allocated cost to the Business with respect to such IT Service for the

shall reflect such actual cost, up to 120% of the applicable allocated cost.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the costs described in clause (i), on the one

thereof owned, licensed or provided by Purchaser, its Affiliates or its
suppliers on Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' behalf, each as modified,
maintained or enhanced from time to time by Purchaser, Chemtura, any of their
respective Affiliates or any third party.

(d) The rules of interpretation set forth in Section 1.02 of the Purchase
Agreement shall apply to this Agreement and are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement, in each case, mutatis mutandis.

  

  

ARTICLE 2

  

Purchase and Sale of Services

  

  

Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale of Services. (a) On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in consideration of the charges described
in Section 3.01 below, Chemtura agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to
Purchaser (or its Affiliates), and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Chemtura,
the transition services set forth on Exhibit A (the services listed on the
schedules thereto and any additional services provided pursuant to Section
2.01(c), the "Services"). Subject to Article 6, Chemtura shall provide, or
cause to provided, each Service for the term of this Agreement or, if
different, the period specified for such Service on Exhibit A (each such
period, a "Service Term").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) It is understood that (i) unless otherwise specified in Exhibit A, the
Services to be provided to Purchaser under this Agreement shall only be
provided for the purpose of (A) conducting the Business in substantially the
same manner as conducted prior to the Closing Date or (B) transitioning and
integrating the Business following the Closing Date, (ii) in the case of any
Service that was provided to the Business by an Affiliate or third party
service provider prior to the Closing Date (each third party service provider,
an "Existing Third Party Provider"), Chemtura may satisfy its obligation to
provide or procure Services hereunder by causing such Affiliate or Third Party
Provider to provide or procure such Services, and (iii) in the case of any
other Service not described in clause (ii), Chemtura may satisfy its
obligation to provide or procure Services hereunder by causing one or more of
its Affiliates or third party service providers (each, a "New Third Party
Provider" and together with the Existing Third Party Providers, the "Third
Party Providers") to provide or procure such Services subject to complying, if
applicable, with the following sentence. If Chemtura wishes to engage any New
Third Party Provider to provide any Service, Chemtura shall notify Purchaser
in writing of its intent and provide Purchaser with the opportunity to
terminate such Service, provided that if Purchaser does not notify Chemtura of
its intent to terminate such Service within 15 days of receipt of Chemtura's
notice, Chemtura may engage such New Third Party Provider. Schedule 2.01(b)
attached hereto sets forth, for informational purposes only, a list of the
Existing Third Party Providers that provide material Services as of the date
hereof. Chemtura may, in its sole discretion, change from time to time the
Affiliates or Third Party Providers that provide or procure such Services,
provided that Chemtura shall remain responsible for the performance of such
Services by all such Affiliates and Third Party Providers; provided, however,
if (x) Chemtura elects to use a Third Party Provider for all or substantially
all of its and its Affiliates' requirements and/or needs and (y) Chemtura is
able to assign, and has assigned, to Purchaser, Chemtura's rights and remedies
against such Third Party Provider, such that Purchaser may pursue such rights
and remedies directly, Chemtura shall have no liability to Purchaser in
connection with a failure to perform by such Third Party Provider that is not
caused by the action or inaction of Chemtura.

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that they may not have identified all of the
services that were provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates to the Business
at any time during the twelve-month period prior to the date hereof and that
are necessary for the continued operation of the Business (such services that
were not identified, "Omitted Services"). If Purchaser desires to have
Chemtura provide any Omitted Service, it shall notify Chemtura in writing
within 60 days following the Closing Date, and Chemtura shall provide such
Omitted Service pursuant to this Agreement as soon as practicable; provided
that Chemtura shall not be required to provide any Omitted Service of the type
set forth on Exhibit C. The amount charged to Purchaser for the performance of
any such Omitted Service shall be equal to Chemtura's Cost of providing such
service. If Chemtura provides, or causes to be provided, any Omitted Services
hereunder, Exhibit A shall be deemed amended to include such Omitted Services.

  

  

Section 2.02. Third Party Licenses and Consents. Chemtura and Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and to keep and maintain in
effect, all governmental or third party licenses and consents required for the
provision of any Service by Chemtura in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; provided that if Chemtura is unable to obtain any such license or
consent, Chemtura shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing and shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
implement an appropriate alternative arrangement that is reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser. The costs relating to obtaining and maintaining any such
licenses or consents, and to implementing any alternative arrangements, shall
be passed through to and paid by Purchaser to the extent that such costs

Section 2.03. Third Party Providers. In the event that Chemtura receives
written notice from any Third Party Provider that such Third Party Provider
intends to terminate a service pursuant to which Chemtura provides a Service
to Purchaser, and if such Service was provided to the Business by a Third
Party Provider prior to the Closing Date, then Chemtura shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) secure the continued provision of that Service from
such Third Party Provider or an alternative service provider or (ii) negotiate
with Purchaser to determine a reasonable and mutually agreeable alternative
means of delivering the Service, or a mutually and reasonably agreeable
substitute service, to Purchaser.

  

  

Section 2.04. Cooperation. Chemtura and Purchaser agree to use good faith
efforts to cooperate in providing for an orderly transition of Services,
including Services terminated pursuant to Section 6.02, to Purchaser or a
successor service provider designated by Purchaser.

Service Costs; Other Charges

  

  

Section 3.01. Service Costs Generally. (a) Purchaser shall pay Chemtura the
Service Costs for the applicable Service.3

  

  

(b) If at any time, or from time to time, after the date hereof there is a
material increase or decrease in Chemtura's Cost of providing a given Service
(whether such Service is performed by a Third Party Provider or by Chemtura
and/or any of its Affiliates, and including any increase or decrease in
Chemtura's cost relating to the actions contemplated by Section 2.03),
Chemtura shall provide Purchaser with written notice thereof (which, in the
case of any increase, shall not be less than 30 days prior to the date on
which the increase shall be deemed to take effect), and Purchaser and Chemtura
hereby agree to increase or decrease, as applicable, the Service Cost with
respect to such Service to account for such change.

  

  

Section 3.02. Taxes. (a) To the extent not otherwise included in the
applicable Service Cost, any federal, state, local or foreign sales, use,
value added, goods and services, or other similar Taxes (but not including any

withholding Taxes) sustained, incurred, or levied with respect to the sale,
performance, provision or delivery of Services ("Sales Taxes") shall be
payable by Purchaser to Chemtura in accordance with Section 3.03. To the
extent Sales Taxes are not included in the Service Cost, the relevant Sales
Taxes will be separately stated on the relevant invoice to Purchaser. Such
Sales Taxes shall be incremental to other payments or charges identified in
this Agreement.

3 Note to Draft: To be discussed in light of the proposed term of the
Services. Chemtura believes that there should be a fee escalator in the event
that the term of the Services extends beyond 6 months following the Closing
Date.

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be
deducted and withheld, from all amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other provision of federal, provincial, state, local or foreign Tax law. In
the event of any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser shall increase the
amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement as necessary so that after
such deduction or withholding has been made, Chemtura or any other applicable
recipient receives an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no
such deduction or withholding been made.

  

  

Section 3.03. Invoicing and Settlement. (a) Unless any Exhibit hereto
indicates otherwise or the parties agree in writing to a different
arrangement, Chemtura shall, by the fifteenth date of each calendar month
during the Term, send to Purchaser an invoice listing the charges for Services
hereunder for the following month (the date of delivery of such invoice, the
"Invoice Date"). The invoice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for
the charges. All invoices shall be sent to Purchaser's address set forth in
Section 11.05(b). In the event that any Service is terminated, or the
applicable Service Term expires, during a calendar month pursuant to Section
6.02, Purchaser shall pay only a pro-rated portion of the relevant charges for
the period in such calendar month during which the Services are to be
provided. In the event that any increase or decrease in any Service Cost was
not reflected in the applicable invoice for the month in which such increase
or decrease takes effect, an appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
subsequent invoice.

  

  

(b) Purchaser agrees to pay on or before the first day of the following month
(each, a "Payment Date"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
payable to the order of Chemtura to such account(s) designated by Chemtura,
all amounts invoiced by Chemtura pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (other than any
amounts as to which Purchaser has a good faith dispute). If Purchaser disputes
in good faith any amount payable pursuant to this Section 3, Purchaser and
Chemtura shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute in accordance with
Section 4.04(b).

The Services

  

  

Section 4.01. Standards of Service. (a) Unless any Exhibit hereto indicates
otherwise or the parties agree in writing to a different arrangement, the
level or volume of any specific Service required to be provided to Purchaser
hereunder shall be at a level or volume consistent in all material respects
with the level or volume, as the case may be, of such specific Service as
utilized by the Business during the twelve-month period prior to the date
hereof (the "Baseline Period").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Chemtura covenants and agrees that the manner in which, and the degree of
care with which, Chemtura provides or procures Services hereunder shall be
substantially consistent with the manner in which, and the degree of care with
which, Chemtura provided or procured such Services for the Business during the
Baseline Period (with appropriate modifications to the manner in which the
Services are provided to reflect that the Business is no longer owned by
Chemtura).

  

  

(c) If Chemtura fails to exercise the degree of care required by Section
4.01(b) in the performance of any Service then, without limiting any other
rights or remedies available to Purchaser, upon receiving the written request
of Purchaser, Chemtura shall promptly correct the error or re-perform or
perform the Service, as reasonably requested by Purchaser.

  

  

(d) Chemtura shall have no obligation to provide any Services hereunder in
respect of any business, assets or properties not forming part of the Business
as of the date hereof.

  

  

Section 4.02. Changes to Services. It is understood and agreed that Chemtura
may from time to time modify or change the nature of any Service or the manner
in which, or level of quality or degree of care with which, any Service is
provided to Purchaser, in each case (i) to the extent Chemtura is making a
similar modification or change in the performance of such services for
Chemtura and its Affiliates or (ii) to comply with Chemtura's written
business, operational and technical environment, standards, policies and
procedures as in effect as of the date hereof (the "Chemtura Policies"),
provided that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not relieve Chemtura of its
obligations with respect to the provision of any Services or limit Purchaser's
use of or access to the Services hereunder. Chemtura shall furnish to
Purchaser not less than 15 days prior written notice with respect to any such
modifications or changes, unless notice of such length would be impracticable
given the circumstances, in which case Chemtura shall provide as much notice
as reasonably practicable under the circumstances (which written notice, in
any event, must be delivered in accordance with Section 11.05 not less than
five Business Days prior to such modifications or changes). Any increase in
Chemtura's Costs as a result of any such modification or change shall not
result in any change in the Service Costs until notice has been provided in
accordance with Section 3.01(b); provided that, subject to compliance with
Section 3.01(b), the associated increase in the Service Costs shall be
retroactively applied to the full period of time commencing from the date of
the increase in Chemtura's Costs.

  

  

Section 4.03. Management of Services by Chemtura. Except as may otherwise be
expressly provided in this Agreement, the management of and control over the
provision of the Services by Chemtura shall reside solely with Chemtura, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herunder, Chemtura shall be permitted
to choose the personnel, methodology, systems, applications and Third Party
Providers utilized in the provision of such Services; provided that Chemtura
shall remain responsible for the performance of the Services in accordance
with this Agreement. The provision, use of and access to the Services shall be
subject to (i) Applicable Law and (ii) the terms of this Agreement.

Section 4.04. Liaisons. (a) Each party shall designate one representative to
act as such party's primary contact person in connection with the Services
(each, a "Liaison"). The Liaisons will oversee the implementation and ongoing
operation of this Agreement and shall attempt in good faith to resolve
disputes between the parties. The parties have designated their respective
initial Liaisons and provided contact information therefor on Exhibit B. The
parties shall ensure that their respective Liaisons shall meet in person or
telephonically at such times as are reasonably requested by Chemtura or
Purchaser to review and discuss the status of, and any issues arising in
connection with, the Services or this Agreement. Each party may re-designate
its Liaison(s) from time to time; provided that it shall notify the other
party in writing of the name and contact information for the newly designated
Liaison(s) in accordance with Section 11.05.

  

  

(b) If the Liaisons are unable to make a decision, resolve a dispute or agree
upon any necessary action, the unresolved matter shall be referred to a senior
officer having the power and authority to resolve the dispute of each of
Chemtura and Purchaser notified to the other party for such purpose from time
to time, who shall attempt in good faith within a period of 14 days to
conclusively resolve any such matter. If such senior officers of the parties
are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days from the date such dispute
was submitted for consideration or such longer period as the parties may
agree, either party may pursue its remedies under Section 11.07.

  

  

Section 4.05. Financial Statements. (a) In addition to the other Services set
forth herein, if the Closing has occurred on or prior to October 1, 2013,
Chemtura will provide assistance with preparing the unaudited combined
statements of income and related consolidating trial balances (income
statement accounts only) and related supporting information of the Business,
including all information necessary to prepare unaudited statements of
operations for the period from June 30, 2014 through the Closing Date. The
period from January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014 shall be governed in
accordance with Section 5.20 of the Purchase Agreement.

  

  

(b) If the Closing has occurred any time after October 1 but before November
5, 2014, Chemtura shall additionally provide to Purchaser a consolidating
trial balance and related supporting schedules of the Business, including all
information necessary to prepare an unaudited balance sheet of the Business as
held and conducted by Chemtura and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2014,
and the related unaudited combined statements of income, comprehensive income
(loss), net parent investment and cash flows of the Business as held and
conducted by Chemtura and its Subsidiaries as of and for the three months
ended September 30, 2014, by no later than December 29, 2014. Third party
expenses incurred in the preparation will be split by the parties.

Confidential Information and Privacy Matters

  

  

Section 7.01. Confidential Information. The parties hereby covenant and agree
to keep confidential all Confidential Information relating to the other party
or any of such other party's Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each party shall cause its employees, representatives, advisors
and agents (their "Representatives") to exercise the same level of care with
respect to Confidential Information relating to the other party or any of its
Affiliates as it would with respect to proprietary information, materials and
processes relating to itself or any of its Affiliates. "Confidential
Information" shall mean all information, materials and processes relating to a
party or any Affiliate of such party obtained by the other party or any
Affiliate of such other party at any time (whether prior to or after the date
hereof) in any format whatsoever (whether orally, visually, in writing,
electronically or in any other form) arising out of the rendering or receipt
of Services hereunder (or preparations for the same or for the termination
thereof) and shall include, but not be limited to, economic and business
information or data, business plans, computer software and information
relating to employees, vendors, customers, products, financial performance and
projections, processes, strategies and systems, but shall not include (i)
information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than
by release in violation of the provisions of this Section 7.01, (ii)
information which is or becomes available on a non-confidential basis to a
party from a source other than the other party to this Agreement or its
Representatives, provided the party in question or its Representatives
reasonably believes that such source is not or was not at the time of
disclosure bound by a legal or contractual obligation to the other party or
one of its Affiliates to hold such information confidential and (iii)
information acquired or developed independently by a party or its
Representatives without use or reference to otherwise Confidential Information
of the other party. Except with the prior written consent of the other party,
each party shall, and shall cause its respective Representatives to, use the
other party's Confidential Information only in connection with the performance
of its obligations hereunder and each party shall, and shall cause its
respective Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to restrict
access to the other party's Confidential Information to those Representatives,
of such party requiring access for the purpose of providing or receiving
Services hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 7.01 to the
contrary, a party and its Representatives may disclose such portion of the
Confidential Information relating to the other party to the extent, but only
to the extent, that such disclosure is required under Applicable Law or the
rules of a Governmental Authority; provided that if not prohibited under
Applicable Law and practicable, the disclosing party shall first notify the
other party hereto of such requirement and allow such party a reasonable
opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy to prevent
such disclosure. The parties acknowledge that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Section 7.01 and
that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable relief in a court
of law in the event of, or to prevent, a breach of this Section 7.01. Each
party shall be responsible for breaches of this paragraph by its
Representatives. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each party
acknowledges that it will not acquire any right, title or interest in or to
any Confidential Information of the other party by reason of this Agreement or
the provision or receipt of Services pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 7.02. Privacy Matters. To the extent that the provision of Services
requires Chemtura to collect, use or disclose, on behalf of Purchaser,
information relating to individuals who are or can be identified from such
information alone or in conjunction with other information ("Personal
Information"), Chemtura shall maintain security procedures and practices to
prevent the unauthorized collection, use and disclosure of such Personal
Information that are substantially the same as those used by Chemtura prior to
the Closing Date in the ordinary course of business, and Chemtura shall
collect, use or disclose such Personal Information only in accordance with
Applicable Law. Chemtura shall treat Personal Information collected, used or
disclosed solely on behalf of Purchaser in connection with this Agreement as
the Confidential Information of Purchaser, provided that Chemtura may disclose
such Personal Information to third parties as necessary to provide Services in
accordance with this Agreement.

and procedures do not conflict with the terms of this Agreement; provided,
further, that to the extent such policies and procedures of Purchaser make the
provision of a given Service impracticable as determined by the parties after
good faith discussion, Chemtura shall cooperate with Purchaser in good faith
in arrangements reasonably acceptable to both parties so as to allow for the
provision of the applicable Service and the compliance with such policies and

Miscellaneous

  

  

Section 11.01. No Agency; Independent Contractor Status. Nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to constitute a partnership or joint
venture between the parties hereto or constitute or be deemed to constitute
any party the agent or employee of the other party for any purpose whatsoever
and neither party shall have authority or power to bind the other or to
contract in the name of, or create a liability against, the other in any way
or for any purpose. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Chemtura is
an independent contractor in the performance of each and every part of this
Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed to be inconsistent with this
status. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Chemtura shall
have the authority to select the means, methods and manner by which any
Service is performed.

  

  

Section 11.02. Subcontractors. Chemtura may hire or engage one or more
subcontractors to perform all or any of its obligations under this Agreement;
provided that, (i) Chemtura shall use the same degree of care in selecting any
subcontractors as it would if such subcontractor was being retained to provide

responsible for ensuring that obligations with respect to the standards of
services set forth in this Agreement are satisfied with respect to any Service
provided by a subcontractor hired or engaged by Chemtura and (iii) Chemtura

  |  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's failure to perform

caused by inability to obtain supplies, acts of God, extreme adverse weather
conditions, war, fire, explosion, flood, strike (beyond the reasonable control

---|---

10.10.2

  |

performance of its affected obligations.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

10.10.5

  |  

At the request of the other Party, the Claiming Party shall use reasonable

Force Majeure Event (save where there are reasonable concerns as to safety),

number of representatives of the other Party, at that other Party's sole risk
and expense, in order that those representatives may verify the impact of that

duration of its effects.
