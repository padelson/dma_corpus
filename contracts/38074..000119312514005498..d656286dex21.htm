successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
certificate of incorporation and by-laws.

SECTION 2.03. _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all shares of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser or any other Person, be
converted into and thereafter evidence in the aggregate 100 Surviving
Corporation Common Shares. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, when converted in
accordance with this _Section 2.03(a)_, shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Share (other than Appraisal Shares, if
any, which in each case shall be canceled, and except as provided in _Section
2.03(d)_) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof (any such holder, an " _Eligible Holder_ "), be converted
into and thereafter evidence the right to receive, without interest, the Per
Share Merger Consideration, as and when payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, less any applicable income or employment tax withholding. Each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
when converted or cancelled in accordance with this _Section 2.03(b)_, shall
no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist.

 

(c) After the Effective Time, each Eligible Holder who holds certificates

respect of each such Company Share, without interest, the Per Share Merger
Consideration, as and when payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
less any applicable income or employment tax withholding, upon surrender of
the certificate(s) evidencing such Company Shares in accordance with _Section
2.04_ and delivery of a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of

17 SECTION 2.04. _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to each
Eligible Holder who has, prior to the date thereof, delivered a duly executed
and completed letter of transmittal and has surrendered the applicable
certificate(s) representing its Company Shares an aggregate amount in cash
equal to (i) the product of the number of Company Shares represented by
such certificate(s) multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii)
less any applicable income or employment tax withholding, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (or, at the request of an Eligible Holder, by
check).

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall enter into a paying agent agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "),
in a form reasonably agreed to by the parties hereto. At the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Paying Agent an aggregate
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of Company
Shares (x) in respect of which a duly executed and completed letter of
transmittal has not been received by the Company or whose certificates have
not been surrendered to the Company, as of the Effective Time and (y) which
are not Appraisal Shares or shares canceled pursuant to _Section 2.03(d)_,
multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. Following the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to each Eligible Holder who has not, as
of the Effective Time, delivered a duly executed and completed letter of
transmittal or surrendered the applicable certificate(s) representing its
Company Shares an aggregate amount in cash equal to (i) the product of the
number of Company Shares represented by such certificate(s) multiplied by the
Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii) less any applicable income or employment
tax withholding, by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or, at the
request of an Eligible Holder, by check) immediately following surrender of
certificate(s) evidencing such Company Shares (or a lost certificate affidavit
and, if applicable, bond) and upon delivery of a duly executed and completed
letter of transmittal.

 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made with
respect to such shares to such a transferee if the certificate representing
such shares is presented to the Company, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Common Stock have been paid.
For the avoidance of doubt, any such transferee that satisfies these
requirements shall be an Eligible Holder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Company Share (an

 



18  " _Appraisal Share_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but
instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Company Share in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the
Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and each
such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, as and when payable in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, without interest and less any applicable income or employment tax
withholding. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands
for appraisal of any Company Shares, and Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

(e) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser (x) a schedule (the " _Purchase Price Schedule_ ")
setting forth (i) the Closing Date Cash, (ii) the Debt Payoff Amount, (iii)
the amount of Stockholders Expenses and (iv) the Aggregate Option Exercise
Price, and, in each case, the components thereof), and (y) a schedule (the "
_Closing Consideration Schedule_ ") setting forth the respective amounts of
the consideration payable at the Closing to each Company Equityholder
pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ (on a holder-by-holder
basis), together with the calculations, set forth in reasonable detail, used
to derive the foregoing amounts. During the period following Purchasers
receipt of the Purchase Price Schedule and the Closing Consideration Schedule
until the Closing, the Company shall make its financial records and backup
materials with respect thereto reasonably available to Purchaser, and
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
discrepancies between the Purchase Price Schedule and Purchasers own good
faith estimates of the amounts set forth therein. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall make such revisions to the Purchase Price Schedule, and any
adjustments to the Closing Consideration Schedule required as a result of such
revisions, as are mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Company. The
Purchase Price Schedule and the Closing Consideration Schedule, as may be
revised in accordance with this _Section 2.04(e)_, shall be accompanied by a
certificate signed by the chief financial officer of the Company certifying
that the information set forth in the Purchase Price Schedule and the Closing
Consideration Schedule was calculated in good faith in accordance with this
Agreement, and such Purchase Price Schedule shall be deemed to set forth the
final Closing Date Cash, Debt Payoff Amount, Aggregate Option Exercise Price,
Stockholders Expenses and Aggregate Purchase Price, in each case, for all
purposes hereunder.

 



19 SECTION 2.05. _Options, RSUs and LTIP Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding Options shall be cancelled and in
full consideration of such cancellation shall be converted into and
thereafter evidence the right to receive, without interest, an aggregate
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over the Exercise Price multiplied by (y) the
number of Company Shares covered by the Option (but not below zero), less any
applicable income or employment tax withholding. Each such Option, when
converted in accordance with this _Section 2.05(a)_, shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and
each holder of any such Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the payments set forth in this _Section
2.05(a)_. The cash payments described in this _Section 2.05(a)_ shall be
made by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll promptly after they
become due and payable under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each
outstanding Option that has an Exercise Price that is equal to or higher than
the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time shall be mandatorily
surrendered to the Company and cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time
for no consideration.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU shall, without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and thereafter evidence the
right to receive, without interest, an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Company Shares covered by the RSU multiplied by
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable income
or employment tax withholding. The right to receive any Company Share under
such a RSU, when converted in accordance with this _Section 2.05(b)_, shall
no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist and each holder of any such RSU shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the payments set forth in this
_Section 2.05(b)_. The cash payment described in this _Section 2.05(b)_
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll promptly after
they become due and payable under this Agreement.

(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Company shall take all actions that it determines are reasonably necessary
to provide that each Option that is unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time and contingent on the Closing having occurred.

(d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding LTIP Award (whether or not by
reason of the Merger) shall, and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and in full consideration of such cancellation, shall be
converted into and thereafter evidence the right to receive, without
interest, an amount equal to the LTIP Award, as set forth on _Schedule
2.05(d)_ next to such holders name, less any applicable income or employment
tax withholding. Each LTIP Award, when converted in accordance with this
_Section 2.05(a)_, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist and each holder of the LTIP Award shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the payments set forth in this _Section 2.05(d)_. The cash payments described
in this _Section 2.05(a)_ shall be made by the Surviving Corporation through
its payroll promptly after they become due and payable under this Agreement.

(e) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Company shall take all actions that it determines are reasonably
necessary to provide that each LTIP Award that is outstanding as of the
Effective Time shall become one-hundred percent (100%) vested at the Effective
Time.

 



20 SECTION 2.06. _Certain Actions in Connection with the Merger_.

 

(a) _Mailing to Stockholders_. As promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
hereof, the Company shall mail to each holder of Company Shares on the date
hereof (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss of the certificates representing Company Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the Company, and which
letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as the
Company may reasonably specify and Purchaser may reasonably request, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such certificates for payment.

(b) _Letters of Transmittal_. The letter of transmittal shall specify that,
in the event of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Closing pursuant
to _Article VIII_ , the Company shall return such certificates to the holder
of record.

 

(c) _Share Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the share transfer books of the Company of any shares of capital
stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, certificates of the Company are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in  _Section
2.03(b)_ and _Section 2.04(a)_.

(d) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Following the Closing Date, any holder
of Company Shares entitled to receive Per Share Merger Consideration who has
not theretofore received payment of such consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.04(a)_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
for payment of any Per Share Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any certificates representing Company Shares held by such holder,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, as a general creditor and without
any interest thereon.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Purchaser, the Paying Agent, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, or any
other Person shall be liable for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
If any certificates representing Company Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which any consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing Company Shares shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person (other than any institutional holder of Company Shares) of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Company or the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent or Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



21 SECTION 2.07. _Withholding Rights; Paying Agent_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld (or caused to be
withheld) by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Authority and (ii) to the extent remitted as provided
in clause (i), shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in (i) the Schedules (subject to the interpretive
principles set forth in _Section 1.04_) or (ii) the Registration Statement
(excluding any disclosure contained in the "Risk Factors" section thereof
(other than statements of fact), and any cautionary or predictive statements
or forward-looking statements contained elsewhere therein), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows:

SECTION 4.01. _Organization and Qualification_. 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties
and assets and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business, or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets,
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered to Purchaser copies of the Governing
Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement for each of the Group
Companies.

(b) _Schedule 4.01(b)_ sets forth the name, jurisdiction of organization and
authorized capitalization of each corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other entity owned, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by
the Company (each, a " _Subsidiary_ ") and for each Subsidiary, the ownership
of all outstanding capital stock, partnership interests and other ownership
or equity interests. Each Subsidiary (i) is a duly organized and validly
existing corporation, partnership or limited liability company in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified
or licensed and in good standing to do business as a foreign corporation,
partnership or limited liability company in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business, or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets, makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so organized, validly existing, in good standing, qualified or
licensed has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.02. _Authority/Binding Effect_. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and corporate authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate action on
the part of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is required to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance hereof by the Company, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) obtaining
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding Company Shares in favor of approving the Merger and adopting this
Agreement (the " _Stockholder Consent_ ") and (ii) filing the Certificate of
Merger pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the other parties hereto, constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other Laws of general

 



24  application affecting enforcement of creditors rights or by principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity). The board of directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called
and held at which all directors of the Company were present, duly and
unanimously adopted resolutions (a) approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
determining that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company
Stockholders, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted for the

Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Group Companies, as of the respective
dates thereof, and the consolidated results of operations and changes in cash
flows of the Group Companies, for the period set forth therein. Each of the
Financial Statements has been prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with GAAP, except as otherwise noted therein. The Group Companies
system of internal controls over financial reporting is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance in all material respects that transactions are recorded
and disclosed as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP.

SECTION 4.04. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except for the
transactions contemplated hereby or as set forth on _Schedule 4.04_ , (a)

or aggregate principal amount of the debt financing contemplated by such
commitment letter) regarding the terms of the debt financing to be provided
thereby (collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the
parties thereto (other than Purchaser) have committed to provide, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, debt financing in the amounts set

in equity), and (C) in full force and effect, (ii) the Commitment Letter has
not been amended or modified, (iii) none of the respective obligations and

or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, by any other party thereto and (iv) no
event has occurred which (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Purchaser

Governmental Authority. No party to this Agreement shall agree to participate
in any material meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation

 



53  or other inquiry unless it consults with the other parties in advance and,

parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws, the parties to this
Agreement shall coordinate and cooperate fully and promptly with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking

applicable, (i) providing information to such Persons and (ii) proposing,
negotiating, committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divesture or disposition of, or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), such of its and

the Subsidiaries, in each case, as may be required to be taken in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any
Litigation, which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or that
would make the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser shall have the right
to determine, in its sole discretion, whether to sell, divest or dispose of
the assets, properties and businesses of Purchaser or its Affiliates, on the
one hand, or the assets, properties and businesses of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or any combination
thereof, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
Order in any Litigation; _provided_ , _further_ , that for this purpose,
Purchaser shall have no obligation hereunder to consummate any of the
transactions described in clause (ii) above prior to the Closing. In addition,
Purchaser shall oppose, through and including Litigation on the merits (and
any appeals with respect thereto), any claim asserted in court or other forum
by any Person in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any decree, Order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that would restrain or prevent the Closing by the Termination Date.

(d) In the event Purchaser or the Company receives a second request under the
HSR Act or any similar inquiry or request under applicable Foreign Antitrust
Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such
party shall promptly comply with 

 



54  such request if necessary (i) as provided by Section 7A(e) of the HSR Act or
(ii) as otherwise provided under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws. For
purposes of this provision, a party shall be deemed to have complied with any
such request by providing a response that the party in good faith believes to
be in substantial compliance and by certifying in writing to the other parties
its prompt, substantial compliance. In the event that a party receives a
subpoena or civil investigative demand requesting materials and information
similar to that usually demanded in a second request under the HSR Act or any
similar inquiry or request under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, such
party shall promptly comply with such subpoena or civil investigative demand.
In the event the Governmental Authority disputes the adequacy of compliance by
a party with respect to a second request under the HSR Act or any similar
inquiry or request under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, subpoena or civil
investigative demand, such party shall endeavor to satisfy the Governmental
Authority so as to minimize any delay in the conduct or resolution of the
investigation.

 

(e) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Foreign
Antitrust Laws and (ii) the Required Purchaser Consents are obtained, the
Company and its Affiliates, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates, shall not
take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay,
as applicable, the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting periods under the HSR Act and such applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws,
or the obtaining of the Required Purchaser Consents from the applicable
Governmental Authorities. 

SECTION 6.05. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws,
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the
Closing Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to,
(i) permit Purchaser and its advisors, accountants, attorneys, authorized
representatives and financing sources to have full access, during regular
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the offices, facilities, assets,
properties, management-level employees, books and records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, (ii) shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Purchaser,
such financial, tax and operating data and other information with respect to
such entities and their respective offices, facilities, assets, properties,
employees, businesses and operations as Purchaser shall from time to time
reasonably request and (iii) instruct the directors, officers, employees,
advisors, attorneys, financial advisors, authorized representatives and
accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Purchaser
in its investigation (including tax structuring) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. All access and investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.05_
shall be coordinated through the Companys General Counsel and shall be
conducted at Purchasers expense and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
or materially interfere with the normal operations of the businesses of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or materially prejudice the rights of its customers, or if the
Company believes in good faith based upon the advice of counsel that such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or
attorney work-product privilege from disclosure of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any 

 



55  Contract of the Company or of the Subsidiaries entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries
will attempt in good faith to make such alternative arrangements as may be
reasonably necessary to provide the relevant information to Purchaser in a way
that would not risk waiver of such privilege, immunity or protection or
contravene such Law or agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the Closing, (i) without the prior written consent
of the Company, Purchaser shall not contact any vendor to, or customer of, the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and provided that the Company

and keep the records held by them relating to the respective businesses of

Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and reasonably
appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable
advance notice, as may be reasonably required by any Eligible Holder in
connection with any insurance claims by, Litigation or Tax audits against,
governmental investigations of, or compliance with legal requirements by, any
Eligible Holder or any of their respective Affiliates. All out-of-pocket costs
incurred in providing access pursuant to this _Section 6.05(b)_ shall be at
the applicable Eligible Holders expense.

(c) The parties shall hold, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
advisors, accountants, attorneys and representatives to hold, any non-public

reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such disclosure, no press
release or other public announcement, statement or comment in response to any

56 SECTION 6.07. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Governing Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, or any
successor to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, to contain
provisions that are no less favorable with respect to the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses of any Persons who at any time
prior to or at the Effective Time are or were officers or directors (or their
equivalent) of the Company or any Subsidiary (each, a " _D andO Indemnified
Person_") with respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (unless and to the extent required by Law) as are set
forth in the applicable Governing Documents as of the date hereof, it being
the intent of the parties that all such officers and directors of the Company
and the Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and that no change, modification or amendment of such documents
or arrangements may be made that will adversely affect any such Persons
right thereto without the prior written consent of that Person.

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 6.07_ and
not in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO
Indemnifying Party_") to, to the same extent that such Persons are
indemnified under the applicable Governing Document, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless (and exculpate and release from any liability to Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries) the DandO Indemnified Persons
against all DandO Expenses and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Losses_") in respect of any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action, inquiry, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising
out or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and arising out of or relating to
acts or omissions occurring or existing at or prior to the Closing (including
in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii)
advance, unconditionally and interest-free, to such DandO Indemnified Persons
all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim
(including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party is otherwise
entitled to assume the defense of such claim and has assumed such defense)
promptly after receipt of statements therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
to the extent required by applicable law that cannot be waived, the Person to
whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an unsecured undertaking to
repay such advances to the extent it is ultimately and finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification. Advance payment of DandO Expenses in connection with any
DandO Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully and finally satisfied. For the
purposes of this _Section 6.07(b)_, " _D andO Expenses_" shall include
attorneys fees, expert fees, arbitrator and mediator fees, and all
other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or otherwise participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to defend to be a witness in or
participate in, any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses,
claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(which items are included in the definition of DandO Losses).

 



57 (c) Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective
Time obtain and fully pay for, at Purchasers expense, "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
ratings as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to officers
and directors liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the
Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage, at least as favorable in the aggregate as the Companys
existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters arising out of or relating to
acts or omissions occurring or existing at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby), and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
"tail" DandO Insurance in full force and effect for its full term. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect the Companys existing DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, for the persons who
are covered by the Companys DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage in the
aggregate at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is
unavailable, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO Insurance for
such six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to the
Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and with
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such DandO
Insurance; _provided_ that if the annual premiums of such coverage exceed such
amount, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount for such six-year period from an insurance carrier with, to the
extent reasonably available, the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to the Companys
existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) in the
aggregate at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person (including
by liquidation, dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
similar action), then, and in each such case, Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.07_.

 



58 (e) Each of the Company, the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall be
a full indemnitor (to the extent required by _Section 6.07(b))_ of first
resort, shall be required to advance the full amount of all DandO Expenses
incurred by a DandO Indemnified Person and shall be liable for the full amount
of all DandO Losses to the extent legally permitted and as required, without
regard to any rights a DandO Indemnified Person may have against TPG Global, LLC
or any of its Affiliates or otherwise or any insurer providing insurance
coverage under an insurance policy issued to TPG Global, LLC or any of its
Affiliates.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights
and benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.07_ shall
not be terminated or modified in any manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such DandO
Indemnified Person. The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person
referred to in _Section 6.07(a)_, his or her heirs and his or her
executors, administrators and personal representatives, each of whom is an
intended third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.07_, and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights, including rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

SECTION 6.08. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on December 31,
2014 (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the relevant employee),
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries
to, provide employees of the Company or any Subsidiary who are not covered by
a collective bargaining agreement or otherwise represented by a
Labor Organization and who remain employed immediately following the Closing
(" _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) at least the same base salary or wage
level and target bonus opportunity as those in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) benefits that are not materially less favorable
in the aggregate than the benefits provided on the date hereof (but in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 6.08(a)_, excluding equity
and equity-based compensation and defined benefits); _provided_ , that until
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Company agree to
keep in effect all severance and retention plans, practices and policies that
are applicable to employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof and set forth on _Schedule 6.08(a)_.

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of the level of
vacation and severance pay benefits under the benefit and compensation plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Closing (other than any equity or
equity-based plan) (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall credit each employee with his or her years of service with
the Company, the Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent
as such employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for
such service under any similar Plan in which such employees participated (or
was eligible to participate) in prior to the Effective Date, except where such
crediting would result in duplication of benefits or compensation with respect
to the same period of services and for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan. The Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that

 



59  Purchaser Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of
pre-existing conditions under any health benefit plan that replaces a similar
Plan in the applicable plan year, to the extent such conditions were waived
or satisfied under such Plan immediately prior to the Closing and under such
health benefit plan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit such
employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses in the
applicable plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
relate.

 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.08_ are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right, including any third party
beneficiary right, (i) in any other Person, including any employee, former
employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Plan
or Purchaser Plan, or (ii) to employment or continued employment or any term
or condition of employment with the Company, any of the Subsidiaries,
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing
contained in this  _Section 6.08(c)_ is intended to be or shall be
considered to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program, agreement,
arrangement or policy of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries, Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation nor shall it interfere with or limit Purchasers,
the Surviving Corporations or any of their Affiliates right to amend, modify
or terminate any Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, policy, contract or arrangement or to terminate the employment of
any employee of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any reason, provided that
the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 6.08(c)_.

 

SECTION 6.09. _Section 280G Cleansing Vote_. No later than five (5) days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall submit and recommend to its
stockholders for approval, meeting the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder,
payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute
"parachute payments," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and
the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder (" _Section 280G
Payments_ "), such that the deduction of such payments and benefits will not
be limited by the application of Section 280G of the Code and the applicable
rulings and final regulations thereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser certification that either (a) the Company
stockholder vote was solicited in conformity with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder and the
requisite Company stockholder approval was obtained with respect to
the Section 280G Payments, or (b) that the Company stockholder approval of
Section 280G Payments was not obtained and that, as a consequence, such
payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent that they
would cause any amount to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the
waivers of those payments and/or benefits duly executed by the affected
individuals (as necessary) prior to the Company stockholder vote. The Company
shall forward to Purchaser and its representatives within a reasonable time
prior to submission to the Companys stockholders copies of all documents
prepared by the Company in connection with this _Section 6.09_, and shall
consider in good faith any comments made by Purchaser or its representatives
regarding the content of such documents.

Agreement or required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation

or any of its Subsidiaries to, prior to the Effective Time, be an issuer or
other obligor with respect to the Financing or require their respective boards
of directors or equivalent governing bodies to approve or authorize the
execution of agreements relating to the Financing. Purchaser shall promptly,

occurrence or non-occurrence would be reasonably likely to cause any such
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied at the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.17_

writing from the Company, specifying the nature of such breach or inaccuracy
and requesting that it be cured and (iii) has not been waived by the
Company;  _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.02(e)_ if it is then in breach of
any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement that would result in the

from any liability (x) (1) pursuant to the sections specified in this _Section
8.03(a)_ that survive such termination or (2) for actual fraud, or (y) except
as expressly provided in any of the provisions that survive such termination,
for any Intentional Breach by a party of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements, in each case that occurred prior to such
termination. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if a court has granted an award of damages in connection with any
breach by Purchaser and/or Merger Sub of the terms or conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Company may, on behalf of the holders of Company Shares,
enforce such award and accept damages for such breach, and Purchaser and
Merger Sub agree that such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain
lost by the holders of Company Shares (taking into consideration all relevant
matters, including the expected premium, other combination opportunities

SECTION 9.08. _Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and any claim, suit, action or proceeding in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether at law or in equity, and whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise), shall be governed by and enforced pursuant to the Laws of the
State of Delaware, its rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding, and so far
as applicable, the merger provisions of the DGCL. Each party hereby

the United States District Court located in the State of Delaware and the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware in
any suit, action or proceeding described in the immediately preceding sentence
of this _Section 9.08(a)_. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the
service of any and all process in any such suit, action or proceeding by the
delivery of such process to such party at the address and in the manner
provided in _Section 9.01_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (i) the United States District Court located in the
State of Delaware or (ii) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
located in Wilmington, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or Third Party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
any forum other than the United States District Court located in the State of
Delaware or the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and that the provisions of _Section 9.08(b)_ relating
to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or Third Party claim. Without in any way limiting any
waiver or limitation of Financing Source liability or any other provision
relating to the Financing Sources and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or Third Party claim of any kind or description,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources and their respective current, former
or future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees, agents or other
representatives in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions

 



72  contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and the appellate courts thereof).

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.08(B)_.

 

SECTION 9.09. _Counterparts, etc._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, scanned pages
or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

SECTION 9.10. _Headings, etc._ The provision of the Table of Contents,
the division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions
and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reading only and shall
not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, subsection or clause
are to the corresponding Article, Section, subsection or clause of this
Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

 

SECTION 9.11. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party hereto and at
the expense of the party so requesting, each other party shall execute and
deliver to such requesting party such documents and take such other action as
such requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



73 SECTION 9.12. _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise
by a party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 

(b) The parties understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings on
each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related to the desire of
the parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, that the transactions contemplated hereby represent a
unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of the parties hereto
and their respective Affiliates and further agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms and further agree that, although
monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and
undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor.
Accordingly, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the
one hand, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. In the event that any Litigation
or arbitration proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party
hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 

(c) The parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of _Section
9.08(b)_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or Third Party claim referenced in the last
sentence of _Section 9.08(a)_.

(d) The remedies available to the Company pursuant to this _Section 9.12_
shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in
equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall
not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative,
seeking to terminate this Agreement and/or pursuing any other remedy to which
it is entitled to at law or in equity.

 

(e) To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to
such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date
shall automatically be extended to the later of (i) the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or
(ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, suit or proceeding.

 



74 SECTION 9.13. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims
or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against the entities
and Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement (or
express guarantors of such parties obligations under this Agreement) in their
capacities as such and no former, current or future stockholders, equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or
limited partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of any party hereto,
or any former, current or future direct or indirect stockholder, equity
holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited
partner, member, manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a
" _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any
party against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or any of
its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from,
any Non-Recourse Party (including any of the Eligible Holders).

SECTION 9.14. _Certain Damages and Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, no party shall be liable for any consequential
damages, damages based upon loss of revenue, income or profits, loss or
diminution in value of assets or securities, damages calculated by "multiple
of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other valuation methodology, or
punitive, special, exemplary or indirect damages, in each case in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether at law or in equity, and whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, after
the Closing, no party may seek to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby except in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation in the inducement of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 9.15. _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Ropes and Gray LLP has
acted as legal counsel to the Company, the Subsidiaries, certain of the
direct and indirect holders of Company Shares and certain of their respective
Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Ropes and Gray LLP intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders of Company Shares
and their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and
the Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Ropes and Gray LLP representing any direct or
indirect holders of the Company Shares or their Affiliates after the Closing
as such representation may relate to Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company, the

 



75  Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences
between direct and indirect holders of Company Shares, the Company and the
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Ropes and
Gray LLP, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to
be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect
holders of Company Shares and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries). Accordingly,
the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall not have access to any
