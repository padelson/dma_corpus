iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made
and entered into as of February 23, 2004, by and among: SYNOPSYS, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"); MOUNTAIN ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"); and
MONOLITHIC SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.



RECITALS



A. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.



B. In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the Company by Parent, it
is proposed that Acquisition Sub make an exchange offer to acquire all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. (Such exchange offer,
as it may be amended from time to time, and as it may be modified to reflect
the election referred to in Section 1.1(b) (if such election is made), is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer.")



C. If Acquisition Sub does not make the election referred to in Section 1.1(b)
(the election referred to in Section 1.1(b) being referred to in this
Agreement as the "All-Cash Election"), then each share of Company Common Stock
accepted for exchange pursuant to the Offer will be exchanged for (i) $6.75,
net to the seller in cash (the "Exchange Offer Cash Amount"), and (ii) a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock having a numerator equal to the
Exchange Offer Cash Amount and having a denominator equal to the Parent
Average Stock Price (the "Applicable Fraction"). If Acquisition Sub makes
the All-Cash Election, then the Offer will become a cash tender offer and
Acquisition Sub will pay $13.50, net to the seller in cash (the "All-Cash
Dollar Amount"), for each share of Company Common Stock accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer.



D. It is further proposed that, after acquiring shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer, Acquisition Sub merge into the Company upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the merger of
Acquisition Sub into the Company being referred to in this Agreement as the
"Merger").



E. If Acquisition Sub does not make the All-Cash Election, then (a) following
the Merger, Parent has agreed to adopt an agreement and plan of merger and
reorganization pursuant to which the Surviving Corporation (as defined in
Section 2.1) will merge into Parent or, at Parents election, into a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (the merger of the Surviving Corporation into
Parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent being referred to in this
Agreement as the "Second Merger"), with Parent or such subsidiary being the
surviving corporation of the Second Merger, and (b) it is intended that the
Offer, the Merger and the Second Merger would together qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").



F. In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement certain stockholders of the Company
are executing and delivering stockholder agreements in favor of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (the "Stockholder Agreements"). AGREEMENT



The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:



Section 1. THE OFFER



1.1 Conduct of the Offer.



(a) Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement (and shall use reasonable efforts to commence the Offer
within ten business days after the public announcement of the terms of this
Agreement);  _provided, however_ , that (i) Acquisition Sub shall not be
required to commence the Offer if any of the conditions set forth in clauses
"(d)," "(j)," "(n)," "(p)" and "(q)" of Exhibit B shall not then be
satisfied, (ii) if any of the conditions set forth in clauses "(a)," "(b),"
"(c)," "(k)," "(l)," "(m)" and "(o)" of Exhibit B shall not then be satisfied,
then Acquisition Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer until such
time as each of said conditions is satisfied (at which time the Offer shall be
commenced unless Acquisition Sub is not then required to commence the Offer by
virtue of clause "(i)," clause "(iii)" or clause "(iv)" of this proviso),
(iii) Acquisition Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer if an event
shall have occurred or a circumstance shall exist that, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent, would make any of the conditions set forth in Exhibit B
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the expiration date of the Offer
(as it may be extended pursuant to Section 1.1(e)), and (iv) Acquisition Sub
shall not be required to commence the Offer if the Company shall not be
prepared to file immediately with the SEC, and to disseminate to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9 (as defined in Section
1.2(c)). (The date on which Acquisition Sub commences the Offer, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Offer Commencement Date.")



(b) Acquisition Sub may make the All-Cash Election at any time (whether before
or after commencement of the Offer), but in no event less than two business
days prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended pursuant
to Section 1.1(e)). To make the All-Cash Election, Acquisition Sub shall cause
to be issued a press release disclosing that Acquisition Sub is changing the
Offer from an exchange offer to a cash tender offer pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. Acquisition Sub shall cause a copy of such press
release to be provided to the Company promptly after it is issued.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Acquisition Sub makes the All-Cash Election, then (i) all obligations of
Parent and Acquisition Sub with respect to the Registration Statement (as
defined in Section 1.1(g)), with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus (as
defined in Section 1.1(g)) and with respect to the Post-Effective Amendment
shall terminate and cease to be of any force or effect, and neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub shall have any liability with respect thereto, (ii) all
obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub with respect to the issuance,
delivery and listing of shares of Parent Common Stock shall terminate and
shall cease to be of any force or effect, and neither Parent nor Acquisition
Sub shall have any liability with respect thereto, and (iii) the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.8 (as they relate to the
Registration Statement and the Post-Effective Amendment), shall cease to be
of any force or effect, and neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall have any
liability with respect thereto. The All-Cash Election, once made by
Acquisition Sub, shall be irrevocable, and thereafter Acquisition Sub will pay
only the All-Cash Dollar Amount for each share of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer, and the Per Share
Consideration shall be only the All-Cash Dollar Amount.



(c) The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for exchange or payment (and
the obligation of Parent to cause Acquisition Sub to accept for exchange or
payment) shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn)
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the condition (the "Minimum
Condition") that there shall be validly tendered (and not withdrawn) a number
of shares of Company Common Stock that, together with any shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the
acceptance for exchange or payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer, represents  



 

2  more than 50% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share Number (as defined below)
and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Exhibit B. (The Minimum Condition
and the other conditions set forth in Exhibit B are referred to collectively
as the "Offer Conditions.") For purposes of this Agreement, the "Adjusted
Outstanding Share Number" shall be the sum of (1) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock for exchange or payment
pursuant to the Offer, _plus_ (2) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all vested options, warrants and
other rights to acquire Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock for exchange or
payment pursuant to the Offer.



(d) Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
(i) increase the Per Share Consideration and (ii) waive or make any other
changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that
without the prior written consent of the Company: (A) the Minimum Condition
may not be amended or waived; (B) except in connection with the All-Cash
Election, no change may be made to the Offer that changes the form of
consideration to be delivered by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer or
decreases any component of the Per Share Consideration; and (C) no change may
be made to the Offer that (1) decreases the number of shares of Company Common
Stock sought to be purchased by Acquisition Sub in the Offer, (2) imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, or (3) except as
provided in Section 1.1(e), extends the expiration date of the Offer beyond
the initial expiration date of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions
of the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to, (x) accept for exchange or payment all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable after Acquisition Sub is permitted to do so under
applicable Legal Requirements and (y) deliver the Per Share Consideration in
exchange for each share of Company Common Stock accepted for exchange or
payment pursuant to the Offer.



(e) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire 20 business days
following the Offer Commencement Date (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the
parties respective termination rights under Section 8.1: (i) if, on any date
as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied and has not been waived, Acquisition Sub may, in its discretion (and
without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer, on
one or more occasions for an additional period of up to 20 business days per
extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Acquisition
Sub may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any
other Person), extend the Offer from time to time for any period required by
any rule or regulation of the SEC applicable to the Offer; (iii) if
Acquisition Sub makes the All-Cash Election, then Acquisition Sub may, in its
discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person),
extend the Offer for a period of 10 business days after the date on which
materials disclosing that Acquisition Sub has made the All-Cash Election are
disseminated to the Companys stockholders; (iv) if, on any date as of which
the Offer is scheduled to expire, the Minimum Condition is satisfied but the
sum of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that have been validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer and the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub is less than 90% of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, then Acquisition Sub
may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer for one additional period of not more than 10
business days; _provided, however_ , that if Acquisition Sub extends the Offer
pursuant to this clause "(iv)," thereafter the obligation of Acquisition Sub
to accept for exchange or payment, and to deliver consideration in exchange
for, shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn)
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in
clauses "(e)," "(f)" and "(j)" of Exhibit B; and (v) Acquisition Sub may, in
its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person),
elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions
thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to
the parties respective termination rights under Section 8.1, if (A) each the
Offer Conditions set forth in clauses "(a)," "(b)," "(c)," "(d),"
"(j)," "(k)," "(l)," "(m)," "(n)," "(o)," "(p)" and "(q)" of Exhibit B is
satisfied or has been waived on any date as of which the Offer is scheduled to
expire, or Acquisition Sub reasonably determines that all of such Offer
Conditions are likely to be satisfied  



 

3  within 15 business days after such date, and (B) any of the other Offer
Conditions is not satisfied and has not been waived on such date, then, to the
extent requested in writing by the Company no less than two business days
prior to such date, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer beyond such date
for an additional period of up to 20 business days, provided that in no event
shall Acquisition Sub be required to extend the Offer to a date later than
July 31, 2004.



(f) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Offer, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued in connection with the Offer. Any holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock in the Offer (after aggregating all fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder in the Offer) shall, in lieu of
such fraction of a share, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction
by the closing trading price of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market on the trading day immediately before the
Acceptance Date.



(g) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, unless the All-
Cash Election shall have been made, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Registration Statement"). The
Registration Statement will include a preliminary prospectus containing the
information required under Rule 14d-4(b) under the Exchange Act (the
"Preliminary Prospectus"). On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall: (i) cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which will contain or
incorporate by reference the Preliminary Prospectus and forms of the related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto being
referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "Offer Documents"); and
(ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement and the Offer Documents and the to comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Registration Statement and the Offer Documents (including all amendments and
supplements thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a
copy or a description of any comments received by Parent, Acquisition Sub or
their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration
Statement or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Registration Statement, the Offer Documents or the
Offer. To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use reasonable efforts (1) to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Registration
Statement or the Offer Documents to the extent such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and (2) to take all steps
necessary to promptly cause the Registration Statement and the Offer
Documents, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub
all information concerning the Acquired Corporations and the Companys
stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(g). Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as possible after its filing and to maintain
its effectiveness for so long as shall be required for the issuance of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. Following the time the
Registration Statement is declared effective, Parent shall file the final
prospectus included therein under Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.



(h) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for exchange or
payment pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding shares of either Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any  



 

4  stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, then the Per Share Consideration shall be adjusted
to the extent appropriate.



1.2 Company Actions.



(a) The Company consents to the Offer and represents and warrants to Parent
and Acquisition Sub that the Companys board of directors, at a meeting duly
called and held, has by the unanimous vote of all directors of the Company (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including
the Offer and the Merger, are in the best interests of the
Companys stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and approved
the Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DGCL"), (iii) declared that this Agreement is advisable, (iv) resolved to
recommend that stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement
(the recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the stockholders
of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement being referred to as the
"Company Board Recommendation"), and (v) to the extent necessary, adopted a
resolution having the effect of causing the Company not to be subject to any
restriction set forth in any state takeover law or similar Legal Requirement
that might otherwise apply to the Stockholder Agreements, the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Subject to Section
1.2(b): (1) the Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents; and (2) the Company agrees that the
Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner
adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, and that no resolution of the board of
directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub
shall be adopted or proposed.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.2(a), the
Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse
to Parent and Acquisition Sub at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if:
(i) an unsolicited, bona fide written offer by a third party to purchase
(whether by tender offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
reorganization or similar transaction) all of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock already held
by such third party) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (ii) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith (after taking into
account the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that such offer constitutes a Superior Offer; (iii) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken into
account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of
such Superior Offer, the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub is required in
order for the Companys board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
and (iv) neither the Company nor any of its Representatives shall have
breached any of the provisions set forth in Section 5.3 in any material
respect.



(c) As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company
shall file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously with the
dissemination of the Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws) disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject only to
Section 1.2(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and with all other applicable Legal
Requirements. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The
Company shall promptly provide Parent and its counsel with a copy or a
description of any comments received by the Company or its counsel from the
SEC or its staff with  



 

5  respect to the Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall respond promptly to any
such comments. To the extent required by the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or by other Legal
Requirements, (i) each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to
correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent or
Acquisition Sub that may be required or reasonably requested in connection
with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(c).



(d) The Company shall promptly provide to Parent (i) a list of the Companys
stockholders as well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares
of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of shares of
Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case accurate and
complete as of the most recent practicable date, and (ii) such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer or the Merger. Except as may
be required by applicable Legal Requirements or legal process, and except as
may be necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall hold in confidence, in accordance with
the terms of the Company/Parent Confidentiality Agreement, any information
contained in any such labels, listings and files provided by the Company to
Parent that constitutes "Confidential Information" of the Company within
the meaning of the Company/Parent Confidentiality Agreement.



1.3 Directors.



(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Date and from time to time thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, on the Companys board of directors determined by
multiplying: (i) the total number of directors on the Companys board of
directors (giving effect to any increase in the size of the Companys board of
directors effected pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)); _by_ (ii) a fraction
having a numerator equal to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub (including all
shares of Company Common Stock accepted for exchange or payment pursuant to
the Offer), and having a denominator equal to the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding. The Company shall take all
action necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Companys board of directors, including seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors and, if such resignations are not obtained, increasing the
size of the Companys board of directors. From and after the Acceptance Date,
to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall also use its
best efforts to: (A) obtain and deliver to Parent the resignation of each
individual who is an officer of any of the Acquired Corporations; and (B)
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members,
rounded up to the next whole number, on (1) each committee of the Companys
board of directors and (2) the board of directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company (and each committee thereof) that represents at least the same
percentage as individuals designated by Parent represent on the board of
directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3,
the Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that, at all times prior to
the Effective Time, at least two of the members of the Companys board of
directors are individuals who were directors of the Company on the date of
this Agreement ("Continuing Directors"); _provided, however_ , that (1) if at
any time prior to the Effective Time there shall be only one Continuing
Director serving as a director of the Company for any reason, then the
Companys board of directors shall cause an individual selected by the
remaining Continuing Director to be appointed to serve on the Companys board
of directors (and such individual shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for all purposes under this Agreement), and (2) if at any time prior to the
Effective Time no Continuing Directors remain on the Companys board of
directors, then the Companys board of directors shall appoint two
individuals who are not officers, employees or affiliates of the Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub to serve on the Companys board of directors (and
such individuals shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes
under this Agreement).



 

6 (b) The Companys obligation to cause Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Companys board of directors shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, so long as Parent shall
have provided to the Company the information with respect to Parent and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are
in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Acquisition Sub,
Parent or any affiliate of Acquisition Sub or Parent may have (with respect
to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Legal Requirements
as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.



(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the
Companys board of directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the
Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall
be required to authorize any Adverse Action (as defined below). For purposes
of this Section 1.3(c), "Adverse Action" shall mean any of the following
actions of the Company, to the extent the action in question could reasonably
be expected to affect adversely the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Parent or Acquisition Sub): (i) any action by the Company with
respect to any amendment or waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement,
the Merger or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company; (ii)
any termination of this Agreement or the Merger by the Company; (iii) any
extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any waiver or
assertion of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement; or (iv) any
other consent or action by the Companys board of directors with respect to
this Agreement or the Merger. The approval of any Adverse Action by a majority
of the Continuing Directors shall constitute the valid authorization of
the Companys board of directors with respect to such Adverse Action, and no
other action on the part of the Company or by any other director of the
Company shall be required to authorize such Adverse Action.



1.4 Top-Up Option.



(a) The Company grants to Parent and Acquisition Sub an assignable
and irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase from the Company the
number of newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock equal to the lesser of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes 91% of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the
issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option
or (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that the
Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that
are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise
committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option.



(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Acquisition Sub, in whole
or in part, at any time on or after the Acceptance Date, provided that the
number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or
Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option
constitutes at least 70% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.4(c), (i) if the
All-Cash Election shall not have been made, the aggregate purchase price
payable for the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or
Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall consist of a combination
of a cash payment and shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) if the All-Cash
Election shall have been made, the aggregate purchase price payable for the
shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Acquisition Sub
pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be payable in cash. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.4(c), if the All-Cash Election shall not have been made,
the aggregate amount of cash payable to the Company in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant
to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such
shares of Company Common Stock by the Exchange Offer Cash Amount, and the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable to the Company
for the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by  



 

7  Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined
by multiplying the number of such shares of Company Common Stock by
the Applicable Fraction, and rounding up to the next whole share. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.4(c), if the All-Cash Election shall have been
made, the aggregate amount of cash payable to the Company in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Acquisition Sub
pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of
such shares of Company Common Stock by the All-Cash Dollar Amount.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.4(b), in
lieu of paying cash (or paying cash and delivering shares of Parent Common
Stock) to the Company as consideration for the shares of Company Common Stock
being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option as described in Section 1.4(b),
Parent or Acquisition Sub may (i) pay to the Company in cash the aggregate
par value of such shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) execute and deliver
to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to: (A) the
amount determined by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock being purchased by Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up
Option _by_ (2) the All-Cash Dollar Amount (whether or not the All-Cash
Election shall have been made);  _minus_ (B) the dollar amount of the cash
payment made pursuant to clause "(i)" of this sentence. Any such promissory
note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum and shall mature on the
first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory
note.



(d) In the event Parent or Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice
setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent or
Acquisition Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the
manner in which Parent or Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable
exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the
purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Acquisition Sub
is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company
Common Stock, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for
such shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or
Acquisition Sub a certificate representing such shares.



Section 2. THE MERGER



2.1 Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company. At the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 2.3), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the
separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease.



2.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



2.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward LLP, 3175 Hanover Street,
Palo Alto, California, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent
(the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second business day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Section 7. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by causing a certificate of merger complying with
Section 251 of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date. The Merger
shall become effective at the time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Effective Time").



 

8 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:



(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety immediately after the Effective Time to conform to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Monolithic System Technology, Inc.";



(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Acquisition Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and



(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.



2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any stockholder
of the Company:



(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;



(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;



(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Sections 2.5(b), 2.5(c), 2.5(d) and 2.7, each share of Company Common Stock
then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive (upon the proper
surrender of the certificate representing such share) the Per Share
Consideration; and



(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Acquisition Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of either Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock
are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Per Share Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate.



(c) If any share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time is unvested or is subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights, then the Per Share Consideration deliverable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) will also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition. The Company shall
take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or
other agreement.



(d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued in connection with the Merger. Any holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder in the Merger) shall, in lieu of
such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holders Stock
Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 2.6(b)), be paid in cash the dollar
amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,  



 

9  determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing trading price of a
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on
the trading day immediately before the date on which the Merger becomes
effective.



2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent (i) cash in an amount equal to the cash payable pursuant to
Section 2.5(a)(iii), (ii) certificates representing any shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) and (iii)
cash sufficient to make any payments in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.5(d), in each case assuming no
holder of Company Common Stock perfects appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL. The cash amounts and any shares of Parent Common Stock so deposited
with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received
by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to
collectively as the "Exchange Fund." The cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in money market funds or
similar short-term liquid investments.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, were record holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock ("Stock Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Stock Certificates to the
Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Stock Certificates. Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate to the Exchange
Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
Parent, (A) the holder of such Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the consideration deliverable to such holder pursuant to
Section 2.5(a)(iii) and any cash payment in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.5(d), and (B) the Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each Stock Certificate shall be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to represent solely the right to receive
the Per Share Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
evidenced by such Stock Certificate. If any Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
to the delivery of any consideration with respect thereto, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Stock Certificate.



(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock Certificate with respect to any
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the
Merger until such holder surrenders such Stock Certificate in accordance with
this Section 2.6 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the
effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends
and distributions, without interest).



(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the Merger
becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Stock
Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.6 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for delivery of consideration in
connection with the Merger. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any
other Person with respect to any cash amounts or shares of Parent Common Stock
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.



 

10 (e) At the Effective Time, holders of Stock Certificates that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books
after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid Stock
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company
Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.6.



(f) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation determines in
good faith may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other Legal
Requirement. To the extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.



(g) If any Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of (i)
the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective or
(ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the consideration that
such Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such
consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.



2.7 Appraisal Rights.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
share of Company Common Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by a
holder who has, as of the Effective Time, preserved such holders appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(iii), and the holder of such share shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share; _provided, however,_ that
if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holder of such share
shall otherwise lose such holders appraisal rights with respect to such
share, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure
to perfect such rights or the loss of such rights, such share shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
(upon the surrender of the Stock Certificate representing such share) the Per
Share Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(iii).



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and (B) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior
to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing
to such payment or settlement offer.



2.8 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, assuming that the All-
Cash Election is not made, the Offer, the Merger and the Second Merger
together are intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 



2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full  



 

11  right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the
name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Corporations), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the Acquired
Corporations to provide, retiree life insurance, retiree health benefits or
other retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, except
as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements. To the
knowledge of the Company, other than commitments made that involve no future
costs to any of the Acquired Corporations, no Acquired Corporation has ever
represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any
former or current employee, consultant or director (either individually or as

material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable

U.S. and non-U.S. securities laws and regulations and applicable foreign Legal
Requirements. The Acquired Corporations have performed all material
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in default  



 

25  or violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or violation by any
other party to, the material terms of any Employee Plan. Each Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a
favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its
qualified status under the Code, and to the knowledge of the Company, there
has been no event, condition or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to result in disqualification under the Code (or in the case of a
Foreign Plan, the equivalent of disqualification under any applicable foreign
Legal Requirement). There are no actions, suits or claims pending, or to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than
routine claims for benefits) against any Employee Plan or against the assets
of any Employee Plan. To the knowledge of the Company, no breach of fiduciary
duty under which any of the Acquired Corporations or one its fiduciaries could
reasonably be expected to incur a material liability has occurred. Each
Employee Plan (other than any Employee Plan to be terminated prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement) can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, without liability to any of the Acquired Corporations (other
than ordinary administration expenses and liability for accrued and vested
benefits). No Employee Plan is under audit, investigation or other Legal
Proceeding by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, or any other
Governmental Body, nor is any such audit, investigation or Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Employee Plan. No mortgage, lien, pledge, charge,
security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of any Employee Plan
imposed under the Code, ERISA or any foreign Legal Requirement exists.
All contributions, premiums and expenses to or in respect of each Employee
Plan have been paid in full or, to the extent not yet due, have been
adequately accrued on the appropriate Acquired Corporations financial
statements.



(i) None of the Acquired Corporations has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur, either directly or indirectly (including as a result of an
indemnification obligation), any material liability under Title I or IV of
ERISA or the penalty, excise tax or joint and several liability provisions of
the Code or any foreign Legal Requirement relating to employee benefit plans
(including Section 406, 409, 502(i), 502(l), 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA, or
Section 4971, 4975 or 4976 of the Code), or under any agreement, instrument or
Legal Requirement pursuant to or under which any of the Acquired Corporations
or any Employee Plan has agreed to indemnify or is required to indemnify any
Person against liability incurred under, or for a violation or failure to
satisfy the requirements of, any such agreement, instrument or Legal
Requirement, and to the knowledge of the Company, no event, transaction or
condition has occurred, exists or is expected to occur which could result in
any such material liability to any of the Acquired Corporations or, after
the Closing, to Parent.



(j) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions (either alone or in combination with another event, whether
contingent or otherwise) will (i) result in any bonus, severance or other
payment or obligation to any current or former employee, consultant or
director of any of the Acquired Corporations (whether or not under any
Employee Plan); (ii) materially increase the benefits payable or provided to,
or result in a forgiveness of indebtedness for any such employee, consultant
or director; (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of payment of any
compensation, equity award or other similar benefit; (iv) result in any
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code (whether or not such
payment is considered to be reasonable compensation for services rendered); or
(v) cause any compensation to fail to be deductible under Section 162(m) of
the Code or any other provision of the Code or any similar foreign Legal
Requirement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and except as
set forth in Part 3.17(j) of the Disclosure Schedule), the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger will not result in the acceleration of vesting of any
unvested Company Options.



(k) The fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued
benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in
such Foreign Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most
recently used to determine employer contributions to and obligations under
such Foreign Plan. Neither the  



 

26  execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall cause any the assets or insurance obligations to be
less than the benefit obligations under such Employee Plan or Foreign Plan.



(l) Except as set forth in Part 3.17(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Acquired Corporations maintains any plan, agreement or arrangement, formal
or informal, that provides material benefits in the nature of severance or
has outstanding any liabilities with respect to material severance benefits.



(m) Except as set forth in Part 3.17(m) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Acquired Corporations has any material liability (including a material
liability arising out of an indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or
similar agreement) relating to any insurance contract held under or purchased
to fund an Employee Plan, the issuer of which is or was insolvent or in
reorganization or the payments under which were suspended.



(n) Except for the Company Option Plans, the ESPP and as set forth in Part
3.17(q) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations
maintains any plan, program or arrangement or is a party to any contract that
provides any material benefits or provides for material payments to any Person
in, based on or measured by the value of any equity security of, or interest
in, the Acquired Corporations.



(o) Except as set forth in Part 3.17(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Acquired Corporation has undertaken any option re-pricing or option exchange
program with respect to Company Options.



(p) Part 3.17(p) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth any and
all indebtedness in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000) owed by any
current or former employee, consultant or director to any of the Acquired
Corporations.



(q) With respect to each state workers compensation arrangement that is
funded wholly or partially through an insurance policy or public or private
fund, all premiums required to have been paid to date under such insurance
policy or fund have been paid, all premiums required to be paid under the
insurance policy or fund through the Closing Date will have been paid on or
before the Closing Date and, as of the Closing Date, there will be no
material liability of any the Acquired Corporations under any such insurance
policy, fund or ancillary agreement with respect to such insurance policy in
the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or
other actual or contingent material liability arising wholly or partially out
of events occurring prior to the Closing Date.



(r) Part 3.17(r) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all employees
of each of the Acquired Corporations as of the date of this Agreement, and
correctly reflects, in all material respects, their wage or salary, any other
compensation payable to them (including compensation payable pursuant to
bonus, deferred compensation or commission arrangements), their dates of
employment and their positions.



(s) Part 3.17(s) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each employee of any
of the Acquired Corporations who is not fully available to perform work
because of disability or other leave and sets forth the basis of such
disability or leave and the anticipated date of return to full service.



(t) None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to, or has a duty to bargain
for, any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor
organization representing any of its employees and there are no labor
organizations representing, purporting to represent or, to the knowledge of
the Company, seeking to represent any employees of any of the Acquired
Corporations. During the three years prior to the date of this Agreement none
of the Acquired Corporations has had any strike, slowdown, work stoppage,
lockout, job action, or threat thereof, or question concerning representation,
by or with respect to any of its employees. All of the employees of the
Acquired Corporations are "at will" employees. The Company has made
available to Parent or its advisors accurate and complete copies of all
employee manuals and handbooks, disclosure materials, policy statements and
written particulars of employment relating to the employment of the employees
of the Acquired Corporations.

all applicable Legal Requirements and any order, ruling, decree, judgment or
arbitration award of any court, arbitrator or any Governmental Body respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,

Corporations is not in compliance with any Environmental Law, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no circumstances that may prevent or

including the Offer and the Merger, are in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the

the DGCL are, and will be, inapplicable to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements and to the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions.
No other state takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement applies or
purports to apply to this Agreement, any of the Stockholder Agreements, the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.



3.24 No Discussions. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Acquired
Corporations, and no Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations, is

any confidentiality, "standstill," nonsolicitation or similar agreement with
any third party to which any of the Acquired Corporations is or was a party or
under which any of the Acquired Corporations has or had any rights.



3.25 Intent to Tender; Vote Required. The Company has been advised and
believes in good faith that all of its directors and executive officers
currently intend to tender all of their shares of Company Common Stock

order to permit the consummation of the Merger, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Required Company
Stockholder Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
the Companys capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement, approve the
Merger or consummate any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

used by any of the Acquired Corporations;



(d) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or result
in a default under, any provision of any Acquired Corporation Contract that

operations of any of the Acquired Corporations); or



(f) result in, or increase the likelihood of, the disclosure or delivery to
any escrowholder or other Person of any Acquired Corporation Source Code, or
the transfer of any material asset of any of the Acquired Corporations to any
Person.

Person in connection with (x) the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company, (y) the execution, delivery or performance of the
Stockholder Agreements or (z) the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions.

event, condition, fact or circumstance, or (B) such event, condition, fact or
circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement; (iii) the Company obtaining knowledge of any material breach of any
covenant of the Company; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
Exhibit B impossible or unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent in writing of any Legal Proceeding or material claim threatened,
commenced or asserted against or with respect to any of the Acquired
Corporations which, if it had been pending on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to have been disclosed in Part 3.21 of the Disclosure
Schedule or which relates to any of the Contemplated Transactions. No
notification given to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2(c) shall limit or
otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties or covenants of the
Company contained in this Agreement.



 

36 (d) The Company shall timely exercise in full any right or option it may have
to repurchase shares of its capital stock which is or becomes exercisable
during the Pre-Closing Period from any current or former employee, consultant,
officer, member of the board of directors or other Person upon termination of
such Persons service to any of the Acquired Corporations; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall use reasonable efforts to notify Parent in
writing at least 10 days in advance of any such repurchase and,
notwithstanding the above, shall only exercise any such repurchase right to
the extent directed by Parent in writing.



5.3 No Solicitation.



(a) The Company shall not directly or indirectly, and shall not authorize or
permit any of the other Acquired Corporations or any Representative of any of
the Acquired Corporations directly or indirectly to, (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or take any action that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any
information regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person
in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating
to any Acquisition Transaction; _provided, however,_ that prior to the
Acceptance Date, this Section 5.3(a) shall not prohibit the Company from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Acquired Corporations to, or
entering into discussions with, any Person in response to a Superior Offer
that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) if (1)
neither the Company nor any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations
shall have breached any of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.3 in any
material respect, (2) the board of directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys
outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the board of
directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable law, (3) at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company no less
favorable to the Company than the provisions of the Company/Parent
Confidentiality Agreement, and (4) at least two business days prior
to furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event any Representative of any of the Acquired
Corporations (whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations) takes any action that, if taken
by the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company,
the taking of such action by such Representative shall be deemed to constitute
a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company for purposes of this Agreement.



(b) If the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or any request for non-public information at
any time during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Company shall promptly (and
in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request) advise Parent orally and in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request (including the identity
of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request, and the terms thereof). The Company shall
keep Parent fully informed with respect to the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request and any modification or proposed
modification thereto.

 



(c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry.



(d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of,
any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the
Acquired  



 

37  Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has
any rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced
each such agreement at the request of Parent. The Company also shall promptly
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or
equity investment to return to the Acquired Corporations all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the
Acquired Corporations.



Section 6. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, take all action
necessary under applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold

Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.



(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Legal Requirements in order to consummate the Merger,
as soon as practicable following the later of the Acceptance Date or the
expiration of any subsequent offering period provided in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, (i) the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and (ii) unless the All-Cash Election shall
have been made, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Post-Effective
Amendment. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
(A) cause the Post-Effective Amendment and the Proxy Statement to comply in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and with all
other applicable Legal Requirements, (B) respond promptly to any comments

Company shall respond promptly to any comments received from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, and shall correct promptly any
information in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Post-Effective
Amendment or to the Proxy Statement, or the Post-Effective Amendment or the
prospectus included therein is amended by Parent to correct any information
therein, the Company shall (1) with respect to the Post-Effective Amendment
and the prospectus included therein, cooperate with Parent in filing such

Statement, promptly prepare such an amendment or supplement and, after
obtaining the consent of Parent to such amendment or supplement, promptly
transmit such amendment or supplement to the Companys stockholders.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
all material regulatory approvals needed to ensure that any Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Offer and the Merger will be registered or qualified
under the securities law of every jurisdiction of the United States in which
any registered holder of  



 

38  Company Common Stock has an address of record; _provided, however,_ that
Parent shall not be required (i) to qualify to do business as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or
(ii) to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Acquisition Sub shall own, by virtue of the Offer or otherwise, at least 90%
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties shall take all
actions necessary and appropriate to cause the merger of Acquisition Sub into
the Company to become effective as soon as practicable without a
stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.



(e) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor
of the adoption of the Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.



6.2 Regulatory Approvals. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to file, as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and
other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body
with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions
and the Stockholder Agreements, and to submit promptly any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, promptly after the
date of this Agreement, prepare and file the notification and report forms
required to be filed under the HSR Act and any notification or other document
required to be filed under any applicable foreign antitrust or competition-
related Legal Requirement in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the
other Contemplated Transactions and the Stockholder Agreements. The Company
and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to (i) any inquiries or
requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of
Justice for additional information or documentation and (ii) any inquiries or
requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust or
competition authority or other Governmental Body in connection with
antitrust or related matters. At the request of Parent, the Company shall
divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or take any other action with respect
to any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired
Corporations, provided that any such action is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.



6.3 Stock Options and ESPP.



(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested and
whether or not the exercise price of such Company Option is in excess of the
value of the Per Share Consideration, shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of
the stock option plan under which such Company Option was issued and the terms
of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced;
_provided, however_ , that each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time under the 1996 Plan shall
be assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 6.3(a) only with the
consent of the holder of such Company Option, and in the absence of such
consent, such Company Option (if not exercised prior to the Effective Time)
shall not be accelerated and shall terminate in accordance with the terms of
the 1996 Plan. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company
Options assumed by Parent shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time, (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for
shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion
Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the per share
exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share
exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, and (iv)
any restriction on the exercise of any Company  



 

39  Option assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the
term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
each Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 6.3(a)
shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as
appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to
the Effective Time, and (B) Parents board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys
board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Company
Option assumed by Parent. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any
Company Options that qualified as "incentive stock options" as defined in
Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time to continue to so qualify
after the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Company Option Plans and
to the extent permitted under the Code; _provided, however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to seek the approval of its stockholders for the Company
Options assumed by Parent or the Company Option Plans even if such approval is
required to qualify the Company Options that were incentive stock options
prior to the Effective Time as incentive stock options after the Effective
Time. For purposes of this Section 6.3(a), "Conversion Ratio" shall mean the
fraction having a numerator equal to the All-Cash Dollar Amount (whether or
not the All-Cash Election shall have been made) and having a denominator equal
to the Parent Average Stock Price; _provided, however_ , that if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall send to each holder of a
Company Option assumed by Parent a written notice setting forth (x)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company
Option, and (y) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Option. Parent shall file with the SEC,
no later than 15 days after the Effective Time, a registration statement on
Form S-8 relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect
to the Company Options assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 6.3(a).
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as any of the assumed Company Options shall
remain outstanding.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3, in
lieu of assuming an outstanding Company Option in accordance with Section
6.3(a), Parent may, at its election, cause such outstanding Company Option to
be replaced by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option in
substitution therefor.



(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Option Plans. Under
the Company Option Plans, Parent shall be able to grant stock awards, to the
extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share
reserves of the Company Option Plans as of the Effective Time (including any
shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of
Company Options that are assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 6.3(a)), except
that (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock,
(ii) all references in the Company Option Plans to a number of shares
of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
referenced shares of Company Common Stock _by_ the Conversion Ratio, and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys
board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to the
administration of the Company Option Plans.



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Company Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 6.3 and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect
thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 6.3.



 

40 (f) The Company shall take such action as is necessary to (i) cause the
exercise (as of the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger
becomes effective) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP, and make
any pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering
period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully
effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP, and
(ii) provide that no further purchase period shall commence under the ESPP;
_provided, however_ , that such exercise and cessation of further purchase
periods shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On such new
exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date
under the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the
purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of the ESPP. At the Effective Time, a holder of a share of Company Common
Stock received under the ESPP shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of such holder, be entitled to receive the Per Share
Consideration with respect thereto upon the surrender of the Stock Certificate
representing such share as provided in Section 2.6. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the
Merger), the Company shall terminate the ESPP.



6.4 Employee Benefits.



(a) Parent agrees that (a) all employees of the Acquired Corporations who
continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees") shall, subject to any necessary transition period
and subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or
Legal Requirements, be eligible to participate in Parents health, vacation
and 401(k) plans, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent, and (b) for purposes of determining a Continuing
Employees eligibility to participate in such plans, such Continuing Employee
shall receive credit under such plans for his or her years of service with
the Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plan of
Parent with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, and
(ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit toward applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits under any group health plan of
Parent for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee for the plan year
that includes the Effective Time under any similar group health plan of the
Company in which such Continuing Employee was participating immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.4(a) or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee of any of the
Acquired Corporations to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment. Except for Indemnified
Persons (as defined in Section 6.5) to the extent of their respective rights
pursuant to Section 6.5, no current or former employee, consultant
or director of any of the Acquired Corporations, and no Continuing Employee,
shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.



(b) The Company shall not take (or cause to be taken) any action to terminate
any employee benefit plan sponsored by any of the Acquired Corporations (or
in which any of the Acquired Corporations participates) that contains a cash
or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code;
_provided, however_ , that if otherwise directed in writing by Parent prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to
terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, any such
employee benefit plan. 



6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 



(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions as
directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in
the Companys bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as
provided in the indemnification agreements between the Company and said
Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the
forms disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect (to the
fullest extent such rights to indemnification are available under and
consistent with Delaware law) for a period of six years from the Effective
Time.



 

41 (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and
officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement in the form disclosed by the Company to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Existing DandO Policy"), to the extent
that directors and officers liability insurance coverage is available on
commercially reasonable terms; _provided, however,_ that (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy or policies of
comparable coverage, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute
policies) in excess of the lesser of (A) $1,000,000 or (B) an amount equal to
125% of the annual premium paid in 2003 for the Existing DandO Policy (the
lesser of such amounts being referred to herein as the "Maximum Premium"). In
the event any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium in the aggregate, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of
the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage
that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 



(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill its obligations
under Sections 6.5(a) and 6.5(b) above. Parent will not permit the Surviving
Corporation (or the surviving corporation in the Second Merger) to merge or
consolidate with any other Person unless the resulting or surviving entity
assumes (by operation of law or otherwise) the obligations imposed by this
Section 6.5.



6.6 Additional Agreements.



(a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions
and the Stockholder Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Section 6.6(b), each party to this Agreement (i)
shall cause to be made all filings (if any) and cause to be given all notices
(if any) required to be made and given by such party or any Subsidiary of
such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions and the Stockholder Agreements, (ii) shall use
reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained each Consent (if any) required to
be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and each
of the other Contemplated Transactions and the Stockholder Agreements, and
(iii) shall use reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other
legal bar to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions or any of the Stockholder Agreements. The Company shall promptly
deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and
each such Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall have any obligation under
this Agreement: (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any
of the Acquired Corporations to dispose of any assets; (ii) to discontinue or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service,
or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to discontinue offering
any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise make available, or cause
any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available, to any
Person, any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired
Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any Person
any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing
Date), or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to hold
separate any assets or operations; (v) to make or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise)
regarding its future operations or the future operations of any of the
Acquired Corporations; or (vi) to contest any Legal Proceeding commenced by
any Governmental Body relating to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions or any of the Stockholder Agreements if Parent
determines in good faith that the costs and other consequences of contesting
such Legal Proceeding would make it inadvisable for Parent or Acquisition Sub
to contest such Legal Proceeding.



 

42 6.7 Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
or any of the Stockholder Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations to,
make any disclosure to employees of any of the Acquired Corporations, to the
public or otherwise regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions or any of the Stockholder Agreements unless (a)
Parent shall have approved such disclosure or (b) the Company shall have been
advised in writing by its outside legal counsel that such disclosure is
required by applicable Legal Requirements and shall have provided Parent with
reasonable advance notice of the Companys intention to make such disclosure
and the content of such disclosure.



6.8 Letter of the Companys Accountants. Unless the All-Cash Election shall
have been made, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Parent a letter of Ernst and Young LLP, dated no more than two
business days before the date on which the Registration Statement becomes
effective (and reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Parent), that
is customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent
public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement.



6.9 Listing. Unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made, Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock being issued
in the Offer to be approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) on The
Nasdaq National Market on or prior to the Acceptance Date, and Parent
shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock being issued in the Merger to
be approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) on The Nasdaq National
Market at or prior to the Effective Time.



6.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock and Company Options in connection with the Merger by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. If the
Company delivers the Section 16 Information (as defined below) to Parent at
least 30 days prior to the Effective Time, then, prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall take such reasonable steps as are required to cause the
acquisition of options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in connection
with the Merger by each individual who, immediately after the Effective Time,
will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. For purposes of
this Section 6.10, "Section 16 Information" shall mean, for each individual
who, immediately after the Effective Time, will become subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Parent, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company
Options held by such individual that are expected to be converted into options
to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger.



6.11 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing (effective as of the
Effective Time) the resignation of each officer and director of each of the
Acquired Corporations (other than those designees of Parent elected or
appointed to the board of directors of each of the Acquired Corporations
pursuant to Section 1.3).



6.12 Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub. During the Pre-Closing Period,
Acquisition Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as
provided in or contemplated by this Agreement. 



6.13 Obligations of Acquisition Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



6.14 Tax Opinions. At or prior to the time of the filing of the Registration
Statement, unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver to Cooley  



 

43  Godward LLP and to Bingham McCutchen LLP tax representation letters in
customary form. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall each confirm to
such counsel the accuracy and completeness of such tax representation letters
as of the Acceptance Date. Following delivery of such tax representation
letters, each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause
Cooley Godward LLP and Bingham McCutchen LLP, respectively, to deliver to it
a tax opinion satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act. In rendering such opinions, each of such counsel shall be
entitled to rely on the tax representation letters described in this Section
6.14.



6.15 Second Merger. Unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made, as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but not later than 15 days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall adopt and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to adopt an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with
respect to the Second Merger pursuant to which, not later than 15 days after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into
Parent or, at Parents election, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with
Parent or such subsidiary being the surviving corporation of the Second
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not cause the Second Merger to be effected unless Parent and the
Company have received, prior to the consummation of the Second Merger, an
opinion of Cooley Godward LLP reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "Closing
Tax Opinion") that the Offer, the Merger and the Second Merger
together should constitute a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Code. The Closing Tax Opinion may rely on the tax representation
letters described in Section 6.14 and on typical assumptions. It is intended
that, unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made, and absent a change
in facts or law subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prevents Parent
from obtaining the Closing Tax Opinion, (i) the Second Merger shall occur,
(ii) the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
followed by the Merger and the Second Merger, together would qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (iii)
this Agreement would constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of section 1.368-2(g) of the regulations under the Code. In the event that
Cooley Godward LLP is unable to render the Closing Tax Opinion, the condition
in this Section 6.15 relating to the delivery of the Closing Tax Opinion to
Parent shall be deemed satisfied if Bingham McCutchen LLP renders the Closing
Tax Opinion to Parent.

the Required Company Stockholder Vote.

 



7.2 No Restraints. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent

44 Section 8. TERMINATION



8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:



(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time;



(b) by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time
if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have
issued a final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling, or shall have taken
any other action, having the effect of (i) permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting (A) the acquisition or acceptance for exchange or
payment of, or the delivery of consideration in exchange for, any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or (B) the Merger, (ii) making
illegal the acquisition of, or the delivery of consideration in exchange for,
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, or (iii) making the
consummation of the Merger illegal; _provided, however,_ that a party shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)

is attributable to the failure of such party to perform in any material
respect any covenant in this Agreement required to be performed by such party
at or prior to the Effective Time;



(c) by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Date
if the Offer shall have expired without Acquisition Sub having accepted shares
of Company Common Stock for exchange or payment pursuant to the Offer;
_provided, however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if (i) the failure of Acquisition
Sub to accept shares of Company Common Stock for exchange or payment pursuant
to the Offer is attributable to the failure of an Offer Condition to be
satisfied, and (ii) the failure of such Offer Condition to be satisfied is
attributable to a failure, on the part of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement, to perform in any material respect any covenant in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party on or prior to the Acceptance Date;



(d) by either Parent or the Company at any time after July 31, 2004 and prior

prior to July 31, 2004; _provided, however,_ that a party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if (i)
the failure of the Acceptance Date to occur on or prior to July 31, 2004 is
attributable to the failure of an Offer Condition to be satisfied, and (ii)
the failure of such Offer Condition to be satisfied is attributable to a
failure on the part of such party to perform in any material respect any
covenant in this Agreement required to be performed by such party on or prior
to the Acceptance Date;



(e) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if a Triggering Event
shall have occurred;



(f) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, in order to
accept a Superior Offer and enter into the Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement (as defined below) relating to such Superior Offer, if (i) such
Superior Offer shall not have resulted from any breach of any of the
provisions of Section 5.3 in any material respect or from any action taken by
the Company or any of its Representatives with the intent of circumventing
any of the provisions set forth in Section 5.3, (ii) the board of directors of
the Company, after satisfying all of the requirements set forth in Section
1.2(b) and otherwise causing the Company to comply in all material respects
with the provisions of this Agreement, shall have authorized the Company to
enter into a binding, written, definitive acquisition agreement providing for
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Superior Offer (the
"Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement"), (iii) the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a written notice (that includes a copy of the Specified
Definitive Acquisition Agreement as an attachment) containing the Companys
representation and warranty that the Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered to the Company by the other
party thereto, that the board of directors of the Company has authorized
the execution and delivery of the Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement
on behalf of the Company and that the Company will enter into the Specified

Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f), (iv) a period of at least five
business days shall have elapsed since the receipt by Parent of such notice,
and the Company shall have made its Representatives fully available during
such period for the purpose of engaging in  



 

45  negotiations with Parent regarding a possible amendment of the Offer or a
possible alternative transaction, (v) any written proposal by Parent to amend
the Offer or enter into an alternative transaction shall have been considered
by the board of directors of the Company in good faith, and the Companys
board of directors shall have determined in good faith (after having taken
into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel and the advice
of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that
the terms of the proposed amended Offer (or other alternative transaction) are
not as favorable to the Companys stockholders, from a financial point of
view, as the terms of the transaction contemplated by the Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement, and (vi) the Company shall have paid to Parent the fee
required to be paid to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c);



(g) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if: (i) any of the
Companys representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate as
of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such
subsequent date), in either case such that the condition set forth in clause
"(a)" or clause "(b)" of Exhibit B would not be satisfied (it being understood
that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date, (A)
all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality
qualifications contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded and (B) any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule
made or purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement
shall be disregarded); or (ii) any of the Companys covenants contained in
this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in
clause "(c)" of Exhibit B would not be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that
(x) if an inaccuracy in any of the Companys representations and warranties
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a
covenant by the Company is curable by the Company within 15 days after the
date of the occurrence of such inaccuracy or breach and the Company is
continuing to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach,
then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(g) on
account of such inaccuracy or breach (1) during the 15-day period commencing
on the date on which the Company receives notice of such inaccuracy or breach
or (2) after such 15-day period if such inaccuracy or breach shall have been
fully cured in a manner that does not result in a breach of any covenant of
the Company, and (y) Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) unless Parent shall have paid any
fee required to be paid by Parent to the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(d);



(h) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if: (i) Parents
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
materially inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become
materially inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement
(as if made on such subsequent date), and the inaccuracy in such
representations and warranties has a material adverse effect on Parents or
Acquisition Subs ability to purchase and pay for shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer or on the Companys ability
to satisfy the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Condition); or (ii)
Parent shall have committed a material breach of its covenants contained in
this Agreement and such breach has a material adverse effect on Parents or
Acquisition Subs ability to purchase and pay for the shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer or on the Companys
ability to satisfy the Offer Conditions (including the Minimum Condition);
_provided, however,_ that if an inaccuracy in any of Parents representations
and warranties or a breach of a covenant by Parent is curable by Parent within
15 days after the date of the occurrence of such inaccuracy or breach and
Parent is continuing to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy
or breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(h) on account of such inaccuracy or breach (1) during the 15-day
period commencing on the date on which Parent receives notice of such
inaccuracy or breach or (2) after such 15-day period if such inaccuracy or
breach shall have been cured in a manner that does not result in a breach of
any covenant of Parent; or



(i) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if (i) a Company
Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred or (ii) any event shall have
occurred or circumstance shall have arisen that, in combination with any other
events or circumstances, could reasonably be expected to have or result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(i)
unless Parent shall have paid any fee required to be paid by Parent to the
Company pursuant to Section 8.3(d).



 

46 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect; _provided, however,_ that (i) this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Section 9 (and the Company/Parent Confidentiality Agreement) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (ii)
except as provided in Section 8.3(d), the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement and (iii) no termination of this Agreement shall in any way affect
any of the parties rights or obligations with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock accepted for exchange or payment pursuant to the Offer
prior to such termination.



8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.



(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be

Merger is consummated; _provided, however,_ that if (i) this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d), (ii)
immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement the number of shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer shall not have satisfied the Minimum Condition, and (iii) all other
Offer Conditions are then satisfied, then, within five business days after
receiving appropriate documentation therefor, Parent shall make a
nonrefundable cash payment to the Company in an amount equal to the lesser of
(A) the aggregate amount of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses actually paid by the Company to its legal and financial advisors
and accountants (at applicable standard or discounted rates) for services
provided by them that relate exclusively to the Contemplated Transactions or
(B) $750,000.



(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d), (ii) at or prior to the time of
the termination of this Agreement the commencement, submission or making of
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been disclosed or announced, (iii)
immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement the number of shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer shall not have satisfied the Minimum Condition, and (iv) within one year
after the date of termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or a definitive agreement contemplating an Acquisition
Transaction is executed, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the
earlier of the time such Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the time
such definitive agreement is executed, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of
$10,000,000 (it being understood that, for the sole purpose of this clause
"(iv)," the references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction"
shall be deemed instead to refer to "40%"). 



(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company shall pay to
Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next sentence, a nonrefundable
fee in the amount of $10,000,000. In the case of termination of
this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the fee referred to in
the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company within two business days
after such termination; and in the case of termination of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the fee referred to in the preceding
sentence shall be paid by the Company at or prior to the time of such
termination.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Parent wishes to terminate this Agreement and (1) determines in good faith
that it may validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), (2)
determines in good faith that it may validly terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(i), or (3) determines in good faith (x) that Parent was
entitled not to accept shares of Company Common Stock for exchange or payment
pursuant to the Offer, (y) that, as of the expiration date of the Offer, all
Offer Conditions were satisfied or had been waived except for one or more of
the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses "(a)," "(b)" and "(d)" of Exhibit
B, and (z) that Parent may validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d), then (i) Parent shall deliver to the Company
a notice of termination specifying that Parent has made the good faith
determination set forth in clause "(1)," clause "(2)" or clause "(3)" of this
sentence, (ii)  



 

47  Parent shall pay to the Company, at or immediately following the delivery by
Parent to the Company of such notice of termination, a nonrefundable fee in
the amount of $10,000,000, (iii) upon the payment by Parent of such
nonrefundable fee, this Agreement shall immediately terminate and be of no
further force or effect, and (iv) following the payment by Parent of such
nonrefundable fee, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability of any
nature to any other party to this Agreement under or relating to this
Agreement (whether for any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, for
any prior breach of this Agreement, for the termination of this Agreement or
otherwise), and no party to this Agreement shall be entitled to contest or
otherwise challenge the termination of this Agreement or the basis therefor;
_provided, however_ , that clause "(iv)" of this sentence shall not prevent
the Company from bringing a contest or challenge that asserts that a
determination set forth in clause "(1)," clause "(2)" or clause "(3)" of this
sentence was not made by Parent in good faith.

 



(e) If either the Company or Parent fails to pay when due any amount payable
under this Section 8.3, then (i) such party shall reimburse the other party

the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually
paid to such party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on the date
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.



Section 9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



9.1 Amendment. Subject to Section 1.3, this Agreement may be amended with the

signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.



9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived
any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.



9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 9.8, this Section 9.3 shall not limit any covenant of the
parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.



9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements
referred to in this Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or

Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect.
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof. In any action between any of the parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions: (a) each
of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally  



 

48  consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state
and federal courts located in the State of Delaware; and (b) if any such

in Delaware. Each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by
jury.



9.6 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained
in Section 3, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part
shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular representation
or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section in
Section 3, and shall not be deemed to relate to or to qualify any other

representation and warranty made by the Company in Section 3.



9.7 Attorneys Fees. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this

enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the Companys rights hereunder may be assigned by
the Company without the prior written consent of Parent, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights by the Company
without such consent shall be void and of no effect. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
(other than (i) the parties hereto and (ii) the Indemnified Persons to the
extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 6.5) any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
