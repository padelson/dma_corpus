Condition to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , if, on the Initial

to expire, the Minimum Tender Condition is the only Offer Condition that has

prior to the Initial Expiration Date or the expiration of any subsequent
period of the Offer (but only a period, at the beginning of which the Minimum
Tender Condition was not satisfied), and the Company provides Parent with a

case, for such shorter period as may be specified by the Company in such
written request. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Acquisition
Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,

and Acquisition Sub and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose reasonable comments on such document or response.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, and
subject to compliance with the terms of _Section 6.3_, in connection with any
filing with the SEC regarding a Company Board Recommendation Change (other
than in the Preliminary Proxy Statement or the Proxy Statement), the Company
shall not be required to provide Parent or Acquisition Sub the opportunity to
review or comment on (or include comments proposed by Parent or Acquisition
Sub in) or permit Parent or Acquisition Sub to participate in any discussions
with the SEC regarding such filing, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or any comments thereon or any other filing by the Company with the SEC, with
respect to such filing.

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Acquisition Sub
promptly with mailing labels containing the 

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-16-  names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a
recent date and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys possession
or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall
furnish to Acquisition Sub such information (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) and assistance as
Parent or Acquisition Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall not use or disclose the information contained in any
such labels, lists, listings and files other than in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information
then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

2.3  _Top-Up_.

(a) _Top-Up_. The Company hereby grants to Acquisition Sub an irrevocable
right (the "Top-Up"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 2.3_, and only for so long as this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, to purchase at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price, up to a number of newly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly and
indirectly owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of the Top-Up
Closing (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), shall constitute one share
more than 90% (determined on a fully diluted basis) of the shares of the
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may not be exercised (i) to
purchase an amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that can be issued without the Company being obligated
to obtain stockholder approval pursuant to NYSE Rule 312.03(c), (ii) unless
the Offer Closing shall have occurred, and (iii) unless, immediately after
such exercise, Parent and its Subsidiaries would own more than 90% of the
Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis. The Top-Up
shall be exercisable only once.

 

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 2.3(a)_ and the satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger,
including _Section 9.1(b)_, if there shall have not been validly tendered in
the Offer and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common
Stock which, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
and its Subsidiaries, would represent at least 90% of the shares of the
Company Common Stock outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) on the
Offer Closing Date (the "Short-Form Threshold"), Acquisition Sub shall be
required to exercise, and shall be deemed to have exercised, the Top-Up for
such number of Top-Up Shares as is necessary for Acquisition Sub to reach the
Short-Form Threshold and on such date shall give the Company prior written
notice specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or
indirectly owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice
(giving effect to the Offer Closing). The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice (and in any event no later than
the Offer Closing Date), deliver written notice to Acquisition Sub specifying,
based on the information provided by Acquisition Sub in its notice, the number
of Top-Up Shares to be purchased. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), which shall take place at the location of
the Merger Closing specified in _Section 3.2_, and shall take place
simultaneously with, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the Offer
Closing, the purchase price owed by Acquisition Sub to the Company to purchase
the Top-Up Shares shall be

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-17-  paid to the Company, at Acquisition Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire
transfer of same-day funds; or (ii) by executing and delivering to the Company
a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase
price pursuant to the Top-Up (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i)
shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (ii) shall bear
simple interest of 5% per annum, (iii) shall be full recourse to Parent and
Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without
premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other material terms. At the Top-Up
Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to Acquisition Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge
that the Top-Up Shares that Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the
Top-Up will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in
reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities
Act. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares,
an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be acquired by
Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

(d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. The Parties agree that any dilutive
impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.7(c)_ and that none of the
Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

 

2.4 _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement,
including the exercise of the Top-Up, and the Offer, unless otherwise
mutually agreed to by the Company and Acquisition Sub, any shares of Company
Common Stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to
be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to
or on behalf of Acquisition Sub.

2.5 _Board of Directors_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the Acceptance
Time and from time to time thereafter, and subject to _Section 2.5(c)_,
Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors,
rounded to the nearest whole number constituting at least a majority of the
directors, on the Company Board as will give Acquisition Sub representation
on the Company Board equal to the product of the number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_) and the percentage that the number of shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or its Affiliates bears
to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, upon Parents request,
promptly, at Parents election, either increase the size of the Company Board
or seek and accept the resignation of such number of directors as is necessary
to enable Parents designees to be elected to the Company Board and to cause
Parents designees to be so elected. At such times, subject to _Section
2.5(c)_, the Company will cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute
the number of members of each committee of the Company Board, rounded up
to the next whole number, that represents the same percentage as such
individuals

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-18-  represent on the Company Board, other than any committee of the Company
Board established to take action under this Agreement which committee shall be
composed only of Independent Directors (as defined in _Section 2.5(c)_).

(b) The Companys obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.
The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.5_, and shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors as is required pursuant to such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 2.5_ and the U.S. federal securities laws. Parent shall provide to
the Company, and shall be solely responsible for, the information and consents
with respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.

 

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the
Board of Directors of the Company to have at least two directors who are (i)
directors on the date of this Agreement, (ii) independent directors for
purposes of the continued listing requirements of the NYSE and (iii)
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (such directors, the "Independent
Directors"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if any Independent Director is
unable to serve due to death or disability or any other reason, the remaining
Independent Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate another
individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director (or directors) on the
date of this Agreement (provided that no such individual is an employee of
Company or its subsidiaries) to fill the vacancy, and such director (or
directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director (or Independent
Directors) for purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent Director remains
prior to the Effective Time, a majority of the members of the Company Board
at the time of the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled to designate
two Persons to fill such vacancies; provided, that such individuals shall not
be employees or officers of the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub and shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and such Persons shall be deemed
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Following the Acceptance
Time and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause
any amendment or termination of this Agreement, any extension by the Company
of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Acquisition Sub or Parent or waiver of any of the Company rights under this
Agreement or other action adversely affecting the rights of the Company
Stockholders (other than Parent or Acquisition Sub), not to be effected
without the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors.
Following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub shall take any action to remove any Independent Director
absent cause.

3.3 _The Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the Merger Closing Date, the Parties
shall file a certificate of ownership and merger or a certificate of merger
(in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by,
and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such date and time as the
Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective
Time".

3.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, Liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub
shall become the claims, obligations, Liabilities, debts and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. Immediately prior to the Merger, the forfeiture
restrictions pertaining to all shares of Company Restricted Stock not validly
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer shall terminate, and

identically to all other shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the
payment of Merger Consideration.

3.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate of Incorporation as in

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-20- 3.6 _Directors and Officers_

 

(a) _Directors_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the
directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 

(b) _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders
of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of capital stock of
Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A)
shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (B) except as provided in _Section 3.7(c)_, the
Appraisal Shares) shall be automatically converted, subject to _Section
3.7(b)_, into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, of such shares of Company
Common Stock in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

(iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company or by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement but without duplication of the provisions of
_Section 2.1(c)_, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or
other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-21-  the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect the effect thereof, and such adjustment to the
Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

(c)  _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, without
any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or written threats
thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit
to do any of the foregoing.

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Each holder of an unvested award of Company
Restricted Stock shall have the right to tender such Company Restricted Stock
into the Offer. Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance
Time"), each share of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested, and
the restrictions thereon shall lapse. Immediately prior to the Merger, the
forfeiture restrictions pertaining to all shares of Company Restricted Stock
not validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer shall
terminate, and all such vested shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be
treated identically to all other shares of Company Common Stock with respect
to the payment of Merger Consideration. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_
under the Company Stock Plan and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all notices and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof.

 

(e) _Company Options_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall assume any
Company Stock Options in connection with the Offer, Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Acceptance Time, each
outstanding, unexpired and unexercised Company Stock Option shall vest and
become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the Acceptance
Time, then upon the Effective Time each Company Stock Option shall be deemed
to be exercised and canceled, with each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive, at the Effective Time or as
soon as practicable thereafter, in consideration of the deemed exercise and
cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger 

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-22-  Consideration minus (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, and
(iii) reduced by applicable withholding Taxes; _provided_ that if the exercise
price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the per
share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and
terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Stock Option agreements and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required
notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof.

 

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement"). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). If any holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such Appraisal Shares, and the Exchange Fund shall
be deemed to include the cash so deposited.

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with
respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to  _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.8(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-23- (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the
holder thereof as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be promptly delivered to Parent and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for,
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims
for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the entering into of an
indemnity with respect to such Certificate and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price, Merger
Consideration, Equity Award Amount and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any
holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock (together, the
"Company Equity Awards"), as applicable, such amounts as Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of the Company
Equity Award, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-24- 3.9 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all Assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of the Company
and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), or
(ii) as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company with, or
furnished by the Company to, the SEC between September 30, 2011 and the date
hereof (excluding, in each case, any disclosure set forth in any risk factor
section or in any other disclosure to the extent they are forward-looking
statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as
follows:

 

4.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing under Delaware Law, and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted
and to own, lease or operate its properties and Assets. The Company is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing (to the extent either such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities
make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
or in good standing is not, individually or in the aggregate, likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and Company By-Laws, as amended to date. Section 4.1 of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each
jurisdiction where the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are organized and
qualified to do business.

 

4.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. Assuming the accuracy of the

Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary (to the extent either such concept is recognized under applicable
Law), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing is not,

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-50-  Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the

Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this _Section
6.2_. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the

or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company,
the Companys Subsidiaries, the Companys Representatives and the Companys

6.2(d)_ (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person or group of Persons that has made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited

_Section 6.2(b)_ that the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, either constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, or (ii) furnish to any Person or group of Persons that
has made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof that was not made in violation of _Section 6.2(b)_ that the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, either constitutes or
is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or afford
to any such Person or group of Persons access to the business, properties,
Assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any management
personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under this
clause (ii) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, if and only
to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding
clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person or group of Persons and the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in
which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof) and of the Companys
intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish non-public information to, such Person or group of Persons, and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such Person
or group of Persons, the Company furnishes such non-public information to
Parent (which may be by posting to the "virtual data room" available to Parent
and its Representatives, provided that Parent receives written or electronic
notice of any such posting) to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished to Parent.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of learning
of the relevant information) notify Parent (1) if the Company receives (i) any
Acquisition Proposal (or any amendments or updates thereto), (ii) any request
for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, and (2) of the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and provide
copies of such Acquisition Proposal (if it was made in writing) and the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry.

6.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent in any
material respect, or publicly propose to

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-51-  withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
in any material respect, the Company Board Recommendation (a "Company Board
Recommendation Change");  _provided_ , _however_ , that a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change if, in response to events, facts or circumstances other
than an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (i) the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; (ii)
the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for
such Company Board Recommendation Change (a "Recommendation Change Notice")
(it being agreed that the Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or
update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or
update or amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not, in and
of itself, constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of
this Agreement); (iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss with Parents Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during
the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the day of delivery by the
Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending four (4)
Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time (it being understood that any
amendment or update of such Recommendation Change Notice shall be considered a
new Recommendation Change Notice and shall start a new four (4) Business Day
period); and (iv) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel),
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
would continue to reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders
a position statement in accordance with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders with respect
to matters other than Parent, Acquisition Sub, this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith (based upon the written opinion of its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law; _provided that_ , for the purposes of clarity, any Company
Board Recommendation Change will be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.3(b) requiring an opinion of the
Companys counsel shall be inferred as giving rise to a duty of such counsel
to any Person other than the Company, nor shall any such opinion, if
delivered, be considered a third-party legal opinion within the generally
accepted meaning of such term.

6.4 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to afford,
Parent and its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-52-  access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the Assets,
properties, books, records, agreements and directors, managers, officers,
representatives, customers and suppliers of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information, (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to a
material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information,
(iii) access to such documents or information would violate any obligation of
confidentiality by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, or (iv) access
to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party
the right to terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and
_provided_ _further_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent
in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement. In the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding
sentence, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the
applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a privilege. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.4_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or Assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties shall be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include the right to perform invasive testing without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent
or any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.4_.

6.5 _Certain Litigation_. Each Party hereto shall promptly advise the other
Parties hereto of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against such
Party or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company
Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to the
Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall keep the other Parties hereto reasonably informed regarding
any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the reasonable opportunity
to participate, at Parents expense, in the defense or settlement of any such
litigation against the Company or Company Board, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.6 _Section 16(b) Exemption: Rule 14d-10(d)_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the extent permitted by Law,
the Company (acting through its compensation committee or its Independent

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-53-  commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employment compensation,
severance and employee benefit agreement, arrangement or understanding entered
into by the Company on or after the date of this Agreement with any of its
officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to
such officers, director or employee to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

6.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company

and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company and
of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

7.1 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) any indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation provision set forth in any certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement and
(ii) all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers and any Person who becomes a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the articles of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and the successors in interest of
each of them, to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law.

(b) In addition to the provisions of  _Section 7.1(a)_, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry directly or indirectly arises out of or pertains to (i) any event,
circumstance or occurrence related to such Indemnified Persons capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or other 

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-54-  Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) the
Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification under this  _Section 7.1(b)_, then the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person
therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable expenses and
attorneys fees) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any
such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry. If, at any time prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers
to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for advancement under this
_Section 7.1(c)_, then the right to advancement asserted in such notice
shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(d) In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i)
Parent shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective
Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof,
Parent will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified
Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii)
each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel,
whether or not Parent shall elect to control the defense of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) Parent shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly
after statements therefor are received, whether or not Parent shall elect to
control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected
without his or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.1(d)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for
"tail" prepaid insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), for the Indemnified Persons, with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to
acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). If such "tail" prepaid
insurance policies have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time, to maintain such policies in
full force and effect, for their full term, and to continue to honor its
respective obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to obtain such "tail"
prepaid 

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-55-  insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time for the Indemnified Persons,
the DandO Insurance (provided that Parent (or any successor) may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage and amounts which are, in the aggregate, as favorable to
the Indemnified Persons as provided in the existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of $200,000; and, _provided_  
_further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(f) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 7.1_.

 

(g) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a beneficiary under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs
and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other Person who is a beneficiary under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (or, if
applicable, the heirs and representatives of such Person). Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(e)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs
and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.1_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries
under the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 7.1(e)_ or the DandO
Insurance (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.1_
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such Persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or
other equivalent organizational documents of, or any and all indemnification
agreements of or entered into by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(h) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this  _Section 7.1_ shall be joint and
several.

(i) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

 

(j) The provisions of this _Section 7.1_ shall survive the Effective Time.
Each Person who is or, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
becomes, an Indemnified Person is an intended third party beneficiary of this
_Section 7.1_ insofar as the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries are obligated hereunder to provide for (i) the right to
indemnification, advancement and

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-56-  reimbursement of expenses, and exculpation of Liabilities, and (ii) the
financial and other resources reasonably necessary to provide for the benefits
contemplated by this Section. Each such Person shall be entitled to enforce
the provisions of this _Section 7.1_ as if such Person were a Party.

7.2  _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans and the Director Equity Award Plan,
as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and
compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate,
any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their
terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee, the Employee
Plans and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and severance
arrangements of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the "Company Plans" but excluding equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements) at benefit levels that are no
less than those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of
this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing
Employee under such Company Plans, or (ii) provide compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Comparable Plans"), or (iii) provide some combination of (i)
and (ii) above such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than equity based benefits and
individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In each case, base compensation as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be decreased for a period of one year following the
Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period.

(d) To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to
any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service need
not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage
or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans), and Parent
shall cause to be waived all eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing conditions
limitations under such plans (such

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-57-  plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts
of such Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending
plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under
the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused
by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and
shall not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit
future accruals.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 7.2_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time.

7.3 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action reasonably
necessary to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement. This _Section 7.3_ shall survive the Merger
Closing for so long as the obligations to be performed by Acquisition Sub and
the Surviving Corporation shall so survive.

7.4 _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. Except as expressly authorized
by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) in advance, none of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall enter into any
Contract, or make or enter into any formal or informal arrangement or other
understanding (whether or not binding), with any Person relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or relating to the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment
or compensation) from and after the Merger Closing.

7.5  _Non-impairment_. Prior to the Merger Closing, neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall enter into any
Contract with any Person on terms that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or the
payment of the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, or to prevent or
materially delay the completion of the other actions required of Parent and
Acquisition Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

(including accounting and legal fees) associated with filing all Tax Returns
related to transfer Taxes incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

fail to take any action that is intended to or would (or would reasonably be
expected to) prevent, impair, delay, or otherwise adversely affect the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the ability of such party to fully
perform its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no

prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (the "Preliminary

-61-  Recommendation); (ii) timely respond to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement (including filing any amendments or
supplements thereto necessary to be filed in response to any such comments);
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to have the SEC confirm that it has
no further comments thereto; and (iv) cause a definitive proxy statement,
letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy accompanying the
proxy statement that will be provided to the Company Stockholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the Stockholders
Meeting (collectively, as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement"), to
be mailed to the Company Stockholders at the earliest practicable date after
the date that the SEC confirms it has no further comments. No material
amendments or supplements to the Preliminary Proxy Statement or the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without prior consultation with
Parent and its counsel. Nothing in this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall limit or
preclude the ability of the Company Board to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change. Parent shall, and shall cause Acquisition Sub to,
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in
connection with its obligations arising under this _Section 8.3(b)_,
including promptly responding to any and all drafts of the Preliminary Proxy
Statement and any and all SEC comment letters and responses thereto, and shall
not unreasonably withhold or delay any action required of either of them in
connection with the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that its obligation to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting, as required by this
_Section 8.3_, shall not be affected by the withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) the Company agrees
that its obligations pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication of any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal.

(d) Parent shall provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the Preliminary Proxy Statement and the Proxy Statement and shall
otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Preliminary Proxy Statement and the Proxy Statement and resolution of
comments of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Parent will cause the
information relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub supplied by it specifically
for inclusion in the Preliminary Proxy Statement and the Proxy Statement, at
the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, not to
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty is
made to the Company by Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Preliminary Proxy Statement and the Proxy Statement promptly
following request therefor from the Company.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, if,
following the Offer Closing and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up, Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock, the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action, including (i) with respect to the transfer to Acquisition Sub of any
shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or its Affiliates, and (ii)
causing the board of directors of Acquisition Sub to adopt the resolutions
required by Section 253 of the DGCL, to cause the Merger to become effective
as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-62- 8.4 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that the restrictions of any state
anti-takeover or other similar Law are or become applicable to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than, with
respect to the Company, as a result of the inaccuracy of the representations
and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub in _Section 5.7(a)_), the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize
the effect of such Law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

8.5 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and
Parent, and thereafter, none of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public release or make any
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the relevant Party
is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the Party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other Party or Parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as
the timing of any such release or announcement, shall be at the final
discretion of the disclosing Party). The restrictions set forth in this
_Section 8.5_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made
or proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3_ or following
a Company Board Recommendation Change.

acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-63- (c) _Purchase of Tendered Shares_. Acquisition Sub shall have accepted for
payment and paid for the shares of Company Common Stock and the shares of

ARTICLE X 

_TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be validly terminated and the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (in the case of the
termination right set forth in _Sections 10.1(b) and (c)_ , at any time prior
to the Effective Time) only as follows (it being understood and hereby agreed
that this Agreement may not be terminated for any other reason or on any
other basis):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; or

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent in the event that the Offer Closing shall
not have occurred on or before December 31, 2012 (such date referred to
herein as the "Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Offer
Closing occurs on or prior to December 31, 2012, the Outside Date shall be
March 31, 2013; and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party hereto (A) whose
actions or omissions have been a principal cause of, or primarily resulted in,
the failure of the Offer Closing to occur on or before such date and such
action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement, or (B) that
is in breach in any material respect of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants under this Agreement at such time; or 

(c) by either the Company or Parent if there shall be any Law enacted by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction after the date of this
Agreement remaining in effect that makes the acceptance for payment of or
payment for Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer illegal or
that prohibits the consummation of the Merger, or any court of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a permanent injunction prohibiting
the acceptance for payment of or payment for Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
injunction shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the case of an injunction a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(c)_ if the issuance
and/or continuation of any such injunction is attributable to the failure of
such Party (or any Affiliate of such Party) to perform any covenant or other
obligation under this Agreement required to be performed by such Party (or any
Affiliate of such Party) at or prior to the Effective Time; or

(d) by the Company, if (i) the Company shall have received an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) has determined is a Superior
Proposal and that did not result from a breach of _Section 6.2_; (ii) the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-64-  counsel) that the failure of the Company Board to terminate this Agreement
and enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a written notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") advising
Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board; (iv) if requested by Parent, the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate with Parent and its Representatives
to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that the
Acquisition Proposal which was determined to be a Superior Proposal no longer
is a Superior Proposal during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time
on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior Proposal
Notice and ending four (4) Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time; (v)
at the end of such four Business Day period, such Acquisition Proposal has
not been withdrawn and the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel),
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that the failure of the Company Board to terminate this Agreement
and enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal would
still reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; and (vi) concurrently with,
and as a condition of, the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays
Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_ (it being agreed
that any change to the financial (including price) or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require the delivery of a new Superior Proposal
Notice and shall trigger a new four (4) Business Day matching period
contemplated by _Section 10.1(d)(iv)_; 

(e) by Parent, if (i) neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub are in breach in any
material respect of any of their respective representations, warranties or
covenants under this Agreement at such time, and (ii) the Company shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) of
paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ would not be satisfied and either such breach is
not capable of cure or, if capable of cure, the Company shall have failed to
cure such breach within thirty (30) Business Days after the Company has
received written notice of such breach from Parent (it being understood that
Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(e)_ in respect of a curable breach set forth in any such
written notice (x) at any time during such thirty (30) Business Day period,
and (y) at any time after such thirty (30) Business Day period if the Company
shall have cured such breach during such thirty (30) Business Day period); or

(f) by Parent, if (i) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change; (ii) a tender or
exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) is commenced by a Person
unaffiliated with Parent and, within ten (10) Business Days after the public
announcement of the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall not have filed a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act recommending that the Company Stockholders
reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of Company Common
Stock into such tender or exchange offer or (iii) the Company Board fails
publicly to reaffirm its adoption and recommendation of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written request by Parent to
provide such reaffirmation following an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(g) by the Company, if (i) the Company is not in breach in any material
respect of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement at such time, and (ii) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached
(A) any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement (which
breach

prevent or materially impede, hinder or delay the performance by Parent or
Acquisition Sub of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement
or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger), or (B) covenants or
obligations hereunder, and, in either case, either such breach is not capable
of cure or, if capable of cure, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have failed

Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 
_Section 10.1(g)_ in respect of a curable breach set forth in any such
written notice (A) at any time during such thirty (30) Business Day period,
and (B) at any time after such thirty (30) Business Day period if Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall have cured such breach during such thirty (30) Business
Day period);

(h) by the Company, if (i) Acquisition Sub fails to commence the Offer within
the time required by _Section 2.1(a)_ or terminates or makes any change to
the Offer in violation of the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) at any
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Acquisition Sub fails to accept for
payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_ and at such time all of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ are
satisfied and no subsequent expiration date for the Offer is established
pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer, except, in the case of
clauses (i) or (ii), any such failure that resulted from a breach by the
Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement; or

(i) by the Company or Parent, if (i) during the pendency of the Offer the
terminating party had not breached its representations, warranties or
covenants in this Agreement in a manner that materially delayed or impeded the
terms of the Offer, and (ii) the Offer shall have expired or been terminated
in accordance with its terms without Parent or Acquisition Sub having accepted
for purchase any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.

 

10.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid

shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable (or any Affiliate, employee, agent or other
representative of such Party or Parties) to the other Party or Parties
hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of _ARTICLE I_ , the last
sentence of _Section 2.2(b)_, the last sentence of _Section 6.4_, _Section
8.6_, this _Section 10.2_,  _Section 10.3_ and _ARTICLE XI_ , each of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to _Section
10.3(f)_, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Party or Parties hereto,
as applicable, from liability for any willful and material breach of, or
fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, no
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

10.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 10.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party or Parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-66- (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ solely due to a failure of the
Minimum Tender Condition or pursuant to _Section 10.1(i)_, (ii) neither
Parent nor Acquisition Sub are in breach in any material respect of any of
their respective representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement at such time, (iii) at or prior to the time of the termination of
this Agreement a third party shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been
withdrawn prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, and (iv)
within two hundred seventy (270) days following the termination of this
Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or
consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether such Acquisition
Proposal is made before or after termination of this Agreement), then the
Company shall pay to Parent $4,173,750 (the "Termination Fee"), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such transaction is
consummated.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such
termination.

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 10.1(e), or by the Company pursuant to  _Section 10.1(g)_ or
_10.1(h)_ , the non-terminating Party shall pay to the terminating Party
$1,250,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the terminating Party, within two (2)
Business Days after such termination , which amount shall represent liquidated
damages with respect to the breach that gave rise to the termination and such
payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the terminating Party
against the non-terminating Party, and any of its respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, equity holders, managers, members,
Affiliates or successors, for the breaches that permitted the termination of
this Agreement and none of the non-terminating Party or any of its respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
managers, members, Affiliates or successors shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing shall limit
the right of the terminating Party to exercise any remedies (at Law or
otherwise) that the terminating Party may have against the non-terminating
Party arising from or relating to fraud or a knowing and intentional breach
of this Agreement.

(f) The Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay the fee due pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in an
award against the Company for such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal
Proceeding.

 

(g) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if the Company pays the

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-67-  Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.3_, then any such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub against the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, equity holders, managers, members,
Affiliates or successors and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or successors shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

10.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) after the
Offer Closing and subject to _Section 3.7(b)_, there shall be no amendment
that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, and (y) after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that
by applicable Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders
without such further approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

10.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party or Parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party or Parties hereto contained

Company). Any agreement on the part of a Party or Parties hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party or Parties, as applicable. Any delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

-69- 11.3 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties, and any assignment without such prior written
approval shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall (i) be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annexes
hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires
in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.
EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES, STOCKHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS OR
REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES,
STOCKHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS OR
REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO
THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF
ITS AFFILIATES, STOCKHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS
OR REPRESENTATIVES, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER
INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES,
WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING
THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING. NEITHER THE COMPANY, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR PARENT OR ACQUISITION
SUB, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF THE
OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES HERETO EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 

11.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except
(a) as set forth in Section 7.1, (but not unless and until the Effective Time
occurs) and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive
the Merger Consideration, as set forth in ARTICLE III. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 10.5_ without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto.

 



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

-70-  Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

11.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

11.7 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that in any such case any breach of this Agreement could not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_, a
Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent

regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions
thereof) as of the expiration of the Offer (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_

Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger under
the HSR Act (or any extension thereof) shall have neither expired nor
terminated; (c) any required approvals of the competent competition authority
of any jurisdiction other than the United States applicable to the Offer or
the Merger under applicable Law shall not have been obtained prior to the
expiration of the Offer or any applicable waiting period thereunder shall not
have been terminated or shall not have expired prior to the expiration of the
Offer; or (d) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be
continuing as of the expiration of the Offer:

(i) there shall be any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent in
nature) issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other restraint or
prohibition of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in effect,
or any Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by
any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and remaining in effect,
that, in any such case, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or the transaction contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) there shall be instituted or pending any material Action by any
Governmental Authority seeking to restrain or prohibit the purchase of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the

any representation or warranty contained in _Section 4.2_, _4.4_ , _4.5_ ,
_4.13(b)_ , _4.19(h)_ or _4.27_ of the Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality or by reference to Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be
true and correct, or any such representation or warranty of the Company that
is not so qualified shall not be true and correct in all materials respects,
in each case as of the date of the Agreement and as of the date of
determination as though made on the date of determination (except to the
extent such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date,
in which case as of such earlier date) or (c) any other representation or
warranty of the Company (other than the

of determination as though made on the date of determination (except to the
extent that such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specified
date, in which case as of such specified date), except, in the case of this
clause (c), where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true as of such dates, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with all agreements, covenants and obligations required to be
performed or complied with by it under this Agreement;

(v) since September 30, 2011, there shall have occurred any change,
circumstance, event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

(vi) other than filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States, any consent, approval or
authorization of any Governmental Authority required of Parent, the Company or
any of their Subsidiaries to consummate the Offer or the Merger shall not have
been obtained, unless the failure to obtain such consent, approval
or authorization has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(vii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set

Acquisition Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure
by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and, each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex
I_ shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of October 31, 2012, by and among Curtiss-Wright Controls, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, Columbia Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and Williams Controls, Inc., a
Delaware corporation.
