Companys business is identified or described in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the

Schedule, the Company is not required, obligated, or under any liability
whatsoever to make any payments by way of royalties, fees or otherwise to any

infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate, any Intellectual Property
rights, rights of publicity or privacy rights of any Person. Except as set

business. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing, violating,
misusing or misappropriating any material Intellectual Property of the
Company, and no such claims have been made in writing against any Person by

the Company is bound which restrict, in any material respect, the rights to
use any of the Companys Intellectual Property.

material Intellectual Property owned by the Company. All employees and
contractors who have developed any material Intellectual Property for the
Company have executed written confidentiality and assignment agreements
irrevocably assigning all right, title and interest in and to such
Intellectual Property to the Company. No present or former employee has any
right, title or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any
material Intellectual Property owned or used by the Company. The Companys
information technology systems are sufficient for the operation of the
Business as currently conducted and, to the Knowledge of the Company, free
from material bugs, defects, viruses and malware and have not materially
malfunctioned or failed within the past three (3) years. The Company has
implemented commercially reasonable backup, security and disaster recovery
measures and technology.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the

license to any Intellectual Property.

all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing, including using
reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment, (B)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Buyer obtaining the
Debt Financing that are within its control, (C) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment (including any "flex" provisions) and (D) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing. The Buyer shall not agree to or permit
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any
of its material rights under, the Debt Commitment or any definitive agreements
related to the Debt Financing (including any and all fee letters), in each
case, without the Companys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Debt
Commitment or any definitive agreements relating thereto, including any and
all fee letters, that amends the Debt Financing in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer may replace and amend
the Debt Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment as of the
date of this Agreement so long as any such addition would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification of any of the Debt Commitment in
accordance with this _Section 6.8(a)(i)_, the term " _Debt Commitment_ "
shall mean the Debt Commitment as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified in accordance with this _Section 6.8(a)(i)_ and, in the event that
the Buyer obtains Alternative Financing in accordance with this _Section
6.8(a)(i)_, the term " _Debt Commitment_ " shall mean the commitment letter or
letters (as amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with
this _Section 6.8(a)(i)_) related to the Alternative Financing.

 



 

(ii) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those described in or
contemplated by the Debt Commitment or this Agreement for any reason, the
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final
day of the Extension Period, alternative financing from alternative sources
(the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would not involve terms that
are less favorable in any material respect to the Buyer and which would not
contain any provisions which would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or
impede the consummation of the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For illustrative purposes only, a change in interest rates
consistent with market changes shall not be deemed a less favorable term. In
the event that Alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.8(a)(ii)_, the Buyer shall comply with its covenants in _Section
6.8(a)(i)_ with respect to such Alternative Financing.

 



 

(iii) Nothing herein shall prohibit Buyer from seeking to replace all or a
portion of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing with proceeds from
a public

 



      
 

 



 

or private offering of equity or debt securities consummated prior to the
expiration of the Extension Period (a " _Securities Financing_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Extension Period_ " shall mean an extension of
the Closing Date (and if the extension would result in a Closing Date beyond
the Termination Date, an extension of the Termination Date) of up to ten (10)
Business Days in order to allow the Buyer the opportunity to close its Debt
Financing, Alternative Financing or Securities Financing; _provided_ that such
Extension Period shall not commence unless the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Section 8.1_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing). If the Extension Period has
not expired and a Securities Financing has not closed on or prior to May 11,
2015, then the Extension Period shall be deemed to have been tolled as of such
date, and the Extension Period shall begin to run again when the Company has
delivered the S-X Business Financials in accordance with _Section 6.10(a)_
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Extension Period is
tolled, in no event shall the remaining period following the delivery of the
S-X Business Financials be less than two (2) Business Days.

 



 

(iv) The Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material
breach by any party to the Debt Commitment (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.8(a)_) of which the
Buyer becomes aware or any termination of the Debt Commitment (or commitments
for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section
6.8(a)_). The Buyer shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and
consummate the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing or Securities
Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.8(a)_).

 



 

(b) _Company Obligations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to
the Buyer, and shall cause the officers, employees and representatives of the
Company to provide to the Buyer, cooperation and information reasonably
requested by the Buyer that is necessary or reasonably required in connection
with any Debt Financing, Alternative Financing or Securities Financing by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the following: (i) using reasonable
best efforts to cause the Companys senior officers and other representatives
to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting sessions and sessions

proposed lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as
applicable, and/or the Buyers or any of its Affiliates auditors in
connection with the Debt Financing, Alternative Financing or Securities
Financing; (iii) providing access to the electronic data room maintained by
the Company to the Debt Financing Sources on a confidential basis; (iv)
providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent the
Company customarily prepares such financial statements within the time such
statements are customarily prepared; and (v) using reasonable best efforts to
cause the Companys independent accountants to cooperate with and assist the
Buyer in preparing customary and appropriate information packages and offering
materials as the parties to the Debt Commitment or other parties participating
in the Debt Financing, Alternative Financing or Securities Financing may
reasonably request; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company. The
Buyer

 



       
 

 



 

shall, promptly upon written request by Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs to the extent such costs are
incurred by the Company in connection with such cooperation provided by the
Company, its officers, employees and other representatives pursuant to the
terms of this _Section 6.8(c)_ or in connection with compliance with its
obligations under this _Section 6.8(c)_ and the Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its officers, employees and representatives from
and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than arising from information provided
by the Sellers Representative or the Company), except in the event such
liabilities or losses arose out of or result from the willful misconduct of
the Company or any of their respective representatives. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ that the Company reasonably approves the manner in which the logos
are used and such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company and its marks.

 



 

Section 6.9. _Financial Information_. Subject to the provisions of _Section

with the Companys accounting policies and procedures, determined in
accordance with GAAP (provided that such balance sheet and statement of income
shall be subject to normal year-end adjustments).

 



 

Section 6.10. _Regulation S-X Compliant Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company and the Sellers acknowledge that the Buyer will be required to
include audited and interim financial statements of the Company in a Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
and any registration statement filed with the SEC by the Buyer pursuant to the
Securities Act. The Financial Statements are attached as _Schedule 3.6(a)_ to
the Disclosure Schedule. If the Extension Period has not expired and a
Securities Financing with aggregate proceeds to the Buyer of at least
$300,000,000 has not closed on or prior to May 11, 2015, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as
of March 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related condensed consolidated statements
of operations, members equity and cash flows for the three months ended March
31, 2015 and 2014, including the notes thereto, as soon as reasonably

(b) The Company and the Sellers Representative will cooperate with the
Buyers reasonable requests in connection with the Buyers compliance with
applicable Laws with respect to the transactions hereunder, including
providing access to the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

management upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours to assist
with SEC reporting obligations of the transactions hereunder, including the
preparation by the Buyer of pro forma financial statements, addressing
purchase accounting issues and preparation of any SEC waiver letters. In
addition, the Company and the Sellers Representative shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Accountants to cooperate
with the Buyer to the extent necessary in connection with this _Section
6.10_, including to deliver to the Buyer any consent that the Buyer is
required to file with the SEC with respect to the S-X Business Financials and
the reference to them as "experts" in any filing of the Buyer with the SEC
that includes or incorporates by reference the S-X Business Financials and
deliver any customary "comfort letter" with respect to any debt and/or equity
financing by the Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that so long as the Company
and the Sellers Representative have used their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Company Accountants to cooperate with the Buyer, the
failure of the Company Accountants to deliver the consent shall not relieve
Buyer of its obligations to close the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this

 **ARTICLE 9**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 9.1. _The Sellers  Indemnification Obligations_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article 9_, after the Closing, the
Sellers, severally and not jointly and in accordance with their respective
Company Unit Ownership Percentages, agree to defend, reimburse, indemnify, and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties against and in respect of all
Adverse Consequences that may be incurred or suffered by or imposed on any
Buyer Indemnified Party that result from, relate to, or arise out of:

 



 

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company and the
Sellers in _Article 3_ of this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any breach by the Company, the Sellers or the Sellers Representative of
any of its or his covenants or agreements in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document;

 



 

(iii) any Indemnified Taxes;

 



 

(iv) any unpaid Company Indebtedness; and

 



 

(v) any unpaid Sellers Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article 9_, after the Closing, each
Seller agrees to defend, reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties against and in respect of all Adverse Consequences that
may be incurred or suffered by or imposed on any Buyer Indemnified Party that
result from, relate to, or arise out of any breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation made by such Seller.

 



 

Section 9.2. _The Buyer s Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the
provisions of this _Article 9_, after the Closing, the Buyer agrees to
defend, reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties
against and in respect of all Adverse Consequences that may be incurred or
suffered by or imposed on any Seller Indemnified Party that result from,
relate to, or arise out of:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Buyer in this
Agreement; and

 



 

(b) any breach by the Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

 



 

Section 9.3. _Indemnification Procedure_.

 



 

(a) If, subsequent to the Closing, any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") asserts a claim for
indemnification for or receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim as to which such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall give
reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to the Party from whom
indemnification is to be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), together with a
statement of any available information regarding such claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the
" _Defense Notice_ ") within 15 days after receipt from the Indemnified Party
of notice of such claim, by which notice the Indemnifying Party shall specify
the counsel it will appoint to defend such claim (" _Defense Counsel_ "), to
conduct at its expense the defense against such Third Party Claim in its own
name, or if necessary in the name of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to approve the
Defense Counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying
Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, all at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ its own counsel and participate in the defense of such, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party.
As a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Partys right to assume control
over the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) it must furnish the Indemnified
Party with reasonable evidence that the Indemnifying Party is and will be able
to satisfy any such liability and (ii) acknowledge its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of the defense
of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, which counsel is subject to the
approval of the Sellers Representative (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), if the claim which the Indemnifying Party
seeks to assume control (i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii) involves criminal
or quasi-criminal allegations unless such allegations are also made against
Mr. Loeb or any of the Sellers or (iii) involves a claim which, upon petition
by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying
Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give a Defense Notice, it shall be
deemed to have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject Third Party
Claim, and in such event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct
such defense in good faith. If the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for
the costs and expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of
periodic bills. If the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct the defense of the

 



      
 

 



 

subject Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own
expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such
defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if so
requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or in the reasonable
written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that
would make such separate representation required under the ethical rules
governing attorneys; and provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be required to pay for more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in connection with any Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) Regardless of which Party defends a Third Party Claim, the other Party
shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim, assisted by counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnified
Party shall not compromise, settle, default on, or admit liability with
respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and, if the Indemnified Party settles, compromises, defaults on, or
admits liability with respect to a Third Party Claim except in compliance with
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party will be liable for all costs, expenses,
settlement amounts, or other Adverse Consequences paid or incurred in
connection therewith and the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The Indemnifying Party
shall not compromise or settle a Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless such compromise or settlement includes as a term thereof an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and such compromise or release
does not impose any non-monetary obligations on the Indemnified Party (and all
monetary obligations are subject to the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement) in which case the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be
required.

 



 

(d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums
due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter and the Indemnifying Party shall be required to pay all
of the sums so due and owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
such notice.

 



 

(e) To the extent that there is an inconsistency between this _Section 9.3_
and _Section 10.5_ as it relates to a Tax Claim or a Tax Contest, the
provisions of _Section 10.5_ shall govern.

 



 

Section 9.4. _Direct Claims_. It is the intent of the Parties that all direct
claims by an Indemnified Party against a Party not arising out of Third Party
Claims shall be subject to and benefit from the terms of this _Article 9_.
Any claim under this _Article 9_ by an Indemnified Party for indemnification
other than indemnification against a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")
will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written
notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30)
days within which to satisfy such Direct

 



       
 

 



 

Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30)
day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim,
in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as
may be available to the Indemnified Party under this _Article 8_.

 



 

Section 9.5. _Failure to Give Timely Notice_. A failure by an Indemnified
Party to give timely, complete, or accurate notice as provided in _Section
9.3_ or _9.4_ shall not affect the rights or obligations of either Party
hereunder except to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party
entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover any
payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise materially
adversely affected or damaged as a result of such failure to give timely,
complete, and accurate notice.

 



 

Section 9.6. _Reduction of Adverse Consequences_. The Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any insurance that
would have the effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences (in which case such
proceeds shall reduce such Adverse Consequences). To the extent any Adverse
Consequences of an Indemnified Party are reduced by receipt of payment under
insurance policies, such payments (net of the expenses of the recovery
thereof) shall be credited against such Adverse Consequences and, if
indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the collection of
such proceeds, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such payments (net of the expenses of the recovery thereof) to the
extent of indemnification payments received in respect of such Adverse
Consequences.

 



 

Section 9.7. _Limitations on Indemnities_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Adverse Consequences subject to
this _Section 9.7(a)_ exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then the Sellers
shall have liability for all Adverse Consequences in excess of the Threshold
Amount up to an amount equal to the Indemnity Cap Amount; _provided_ that this
_Section 9.7(a)_ shall not apply to a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in _Section 3.1_ (Organization), _Section 3.2_
(Capitalization), _Section 3.3(a)_ (Authorization of Transaction), _Section
3.4_ (Brokers Fees) or _Section 3.5_ (Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "
_Company Fundamental Representations_ "), Section 4.1 (Capitalization) or
4.2(a) (Authorization of Transaction) (collectively, the " _Seller Fundamental
Representations_ ") or _Section 3.8_ (Taxes).

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Adverse Consequences subject to
this _Section 9.7(b)_ exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then the Buyer shall
have liability for all Adverse Consequences in excess of the Threshold Amount
up to an amount equal to the Indemnity Cap Amount; _provided_ that this
_Section 9.7(b)_ shall not apply to a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in _Section 5.1_ (Organization) or _Section 5.2(a)_
(Authorization of Transaction) (collectively, the " _Buyer Fundamental
Representations_ ").

 



 

(c) Each Sellers liability pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(i) and 9.1(b) shall
not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller;
_provided_ that this _Section 9.7(c)_ shall not apply in the event of fraud
on the part of any of the Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) For purposes of calculating Adverse Consequences hereunder, any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be ignored.

 



 

Section 9.8. _Claims Made Against the Indemnity Escrow Fund_. All claims for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall first be satisfied to the
maximum extent possible from the then remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund. If, and to the extent, that the Indemnity Escrow Fund has been exhausted
(or would be exhausted if one or more pending claims by the Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ are resolved in favor of the Buyer), then the Buyer may assert
a claim for any amount exceeding the Indemnity Escrow Amount directly against
the Sellers and the obligations of each Seller with respect thereto shall be
several but not joint in nature based on the Company Unit Ownership Percentage
of each Seller of the amount of such claim in excess of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims for
indemnification by the Buyer arising out of breaches of the Seller Fundamental
Representations, the Buyer shall not seek recovery against the Indemnity
Escrow Fund and shall instead have the right to demand satisfaction of such
claimed amount directly from the breaching Seller.

 



 

Section 9.9. _Survival_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.9_, the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall expire on, and any claim for
indemnification with respect thereto must be brought before, the date that is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Company Fundamental Representations, the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing indefinitely.

 



 

(c) The Companys and the Sellers representations and warranties contained in
_Section 3.8_ (Taxes) shall expire on, and any claim for indemnification with
respect thereto must be brought before, the date that is six (6) months
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

(d) All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing indefinitely.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 10.1. _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of determining the amount
of Taxes that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle
Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date) the parties agree as follows:

 



 

(a) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to the
portion of the

 



      
 

 



 

Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 

(b) In the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, employment Taxes,
and sales and use Taxes) for a Straddle Period, the amount attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
as if the Company filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology." For purposes of
clause (b), any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates)
shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date based on the mechanics set forth in clause (a) for periodic Taxes.

 



 

(c) In the case of all Taxes in the form of interest or penalties that relate
to Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), all such Taxes shall be treated
as occurring in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such items are incurred, accrued,
assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 10.2. _Cooperation_. With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), the Buyer, the
Sellers Representative and the Sellers shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) (a) assist in the preparation and timely filing of
any Tax Return of the Company; (b) assist in any audit or other Proceeding
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company (whether or not a Tax
Contest); (c) make available any information, records, or other documents
relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company; (d) provide any
information necessary or reasonably requested to allow the Buyer or the
Company to comply with any information reporting or withholding requirements
contained in applicable Laws; and (e) provide certificates or forms, and
timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to establish
an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

 



 

Section 10.3. _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local, non-U.S. transfer,
excise, sales, use, ad valorem value added, registration, stamp, recording,
property and similar Taxes or fees applicable to, imposed upon, or arising out
of the transfer of the shares in the Company or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and all related interest and penalties
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid 50% by the Sellers and 50%
by the Buyer.

 



 

Section 10.4. _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers Representative, at the Sellers sole cost and expense, shall
prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all (i) Tax
Returns for the Company due on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) the IRS
Form 1065 (and any comparable state and local Tax Returns) of the Company for
any taxable periods ending, or deemed to end, on or prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Flow-Through Returns_ " and, collectively with the returns in (i), the
" _Pre-Closing Returns_ "). All Pre-Closing Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures and practices of the Company with respect
to the treatment of specific items

 



      
 

 



 

on the returns, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Flow-Through
Return due after the Closing Date shall be submitted to the Buyer, for the
Buyers review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of
such Flow-Through Return and the Sellers Representative shall consider in
good faith any of the Buyers comments. To the extent required by Law, the
Buyer shall cause the Company to file, in the form approved by the Buyer, all
Pre-Closing Returns prepared by the Sellers Representative and timely
delivered to the Buyer in accordance with this _Section 10.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns of the Company due after the Closing Date other than Pre-Closing
Returns (the " _Buyer Prepared Returns_ "). To the extent that a Buyer
Prepared Return relates to a Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall be
prepared in accordance with existing procedures and practices of the Company
with respect to the treatment of specific items on such Buyer Prepared
Returns, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Buyer Prepared
Return that shows an Indemnified Tax and is not prepared in accordance with
existing procedures and practices of the Company shall be submitted to the
Sellers Representative for the review and comment of the Sellers
Representative at least ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return
and Buyer shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by Sellers
Representative to such Buyer Prepared Return. No failure or delay of the Buyer
in providing Buyer Prepared Returns for the review of the Sellers
Representative shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities
of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent Sellers were
actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, the Buyer agrees not to cause the Company to amend
or modify any Pre-Closing Tax Return without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative if the effect of such amendment or modification could
be to increase the Taxes of the Company or Sellers for which Sellers could be
liable (including pursuant to this _Article 10_), unless required to do so by
a final determination of an applicable Governmental Entity.

 



 

Section 10.5. _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) If any Governmental Entity issues to the Company (i) a written notice of
its intent to audit or conduct another Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (ii) a written
notice of deficiency for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Buyer or the Company shall notify the Sellers
Representative of its receipt of such communication from the Governmental
Entity within thirty (30) days of receipt. No failure or delay of the Buyer or
the Company in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise
affect the obligations or liabilities of the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement, except to the extent the Sellers are actually prejudiced by such
failure or delay. The Company shall control any audit or other Proceeding in
respect of any Taxes of the Company (a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Tax Contest relates to a Flow-Through Return of the
Company, the Sellers Representative shall have the right to assume control of
such Tax Contest if within ten (10) days of receiving notice of the Tax
Contest, the Sellers Representative notifies the Buyer of its intent to take
control of such Tax Contest.

 



 

(b) If the Sellers Representative does not control a Tax Contest for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (i) the Company shall control such Tax Contest in good
faith; (ii) the

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers Representative shall have the right, at the sole cost and expense of
the Sellers, to participate in such Tax Contest; (iii) the Buyer and the
Company shall keep the Sellers Representative reasonably informed regarding
the status of such Tax Contest; and (iv) the Buyer shall not allow the Company
to settle, resolve, or abandon such Tax Contest if it would result in the
Sellers paying any Taxes hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

(c) If the Sellers Representative controls a Tax Contest pursuant to _Section
10.5(a)_, (i) the Sellers Representative shall control such Tax Contest
diligently and in good faith; (ii) the Sellers shall bear all costs and
expenses in connection with such Tax Contest; (iii) the Sellers
Representative shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status
of such Tax Contest; (iv) the Buyer shall have the right to participate, or
cause the Company to participate, in such Tax Contest; and (v) the Sellers
Representative shall not, without the Buyers prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle, resolve
or abandon (or allow the Company to settle, resolve or abandon) the Tax
Contest (or any portion thereof). If Buyer fails to consent to any proposed
settlement, the Buyer shall be responsible for all costs and expenses,
including fees and expenses of Sellers counsel, and any Taxes incurred by the
Company or the Sellers in excess of the proposed settlement amount.

 



 

Section 10.6. _Purchase Price Allocation_. For income Tax purposes, the
parties agree that, in accordance with IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6 (Situation 2),
the Buyer shall be treated as acquiring the assets of the Company (the "
_Purchased Assets_ ") , and the Sellers shall be treated as selling their
respective interests in the Company to the Buyer. Within sixty (60) days after
the determination of Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Sellers Representative a schedule allocating the Purchase
Price and applicable covenants in _Section 10.2_ (and any assumed liabilities
of the Company) among the Purchased Assets for income Tax purposes in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (the " _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_ "). If the
Sellers Representative disputes any amounts as shown on the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, Sellers Representative shall deliver to Buyer within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule a
notice (the "Allocation Schedule Dispute Notice") setting forth the Sellers
Representatives calculation of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and
components thereof and describing in reasonable detail the basis for the
determination of such different amount. If the Sellers Representative does
not deliver an Allocation Schedule Dispute Notice to Buyer within such thirty
(30) day period, then the Allocation Notice provided by Buyer and the
components thereof shall be deemed to be the final Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule. Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any differences and if they are unable to
resolve such differences within thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt of the
Allocation Schedule Dispute Notice, then the Unaffiliated Firm shall make the
final determination of the allocation, but only taking into account the
positions of the parties. The Buyer and each Seller shall report, act, and
file all Tax Returns and information reports consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule (as appropriately adjusted) and shall not take any
position during the course of any audit or other Proceeding that is
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, unless required to
do so by applicable Law or a final determination of an applicable Governmental
Entity. The Buyer and the Seller shall make

 



      
 

 



 

appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to reflect
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 11.1. _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may, by written
notice given prior to or at the Closing, be terminated as follows:

 



 

(a) by the Sellers Representative:

 



 

(i) if the Buyer breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein such that the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach
is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that the
Sellers Representative shall have given the Buyer at least 30 days written
notice prior to such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(a)(i)_; and _provided further_
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ if the Company, any Seller or the Sellers
Representative is then in material breach of any of its or his covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) (x) if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but which conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), (y) the
Company has irrevocably certified by written notice to the Buyer that all
conditions in _Section 8.2_ have been waived or satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but which
conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination) and that the Sellers are prepared to consummate the Closing and
(z) the Buyer has failed to consummate the Closing within two (2) Business
Days following the later of (i) the delivery of such notice; and (ii) the
final day of the Extension Period; _provided_ that such conditions to Closing
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ remain satisfied and such
irrevocable certification remains in full force and effect at the close of
business on such third (3rd) Business Day;

 



 

(b) by the Buyer if the Company, any Seller or the Sellers Representative
breaches any of its or his representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein such that the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 8.1(a)_, _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_ would not be
satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date;
_provided_ that the Buyer shall have given the Sellers Representative at
least 30 days written notice prior to such termination stating the Buyers
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(b)_; and
_provided further_ that the Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(b)_ if the Buyer is then in material
breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by mutual consent of the Buyer and the Company;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Closing has not occurred on or
before July 20, 2015, subject to extension pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)(iii)_
(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that a Party may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(d)_ if any action of such Party or
the failure of such Party (including, for purposes of the Company, any action
or failure of any Seller or the Sellers Representative) to perform any of its
or his obligations under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior
to the Closing has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date and such action or failure
to perform constitutes a breach of this Agreement; or

 



 

(e) by the Company or the Buyer if there shall be in effect a final
nonappealable order, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling, writ, assessment or
arbitration award of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 11.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) Upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, this
Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
abandoned without further action by any of the Parties hereto; _provided_ that
the provisions of this _Article 11_, the second sentence of _Section 5.4_,
_Article 12_ and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such
termination. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, none of the
Parties hereto shall have any further obligation or liability to the other
Parties hereto, except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the following
sentence and _Section 11.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, except with respect to a Financing Termination, each of the
parties shall be entitled to any remedy to which such party may be entitled at
law or in equity for the violation or breach by any other party of any
agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
and if any party shall bring an action to enforce this Agreement, the
prevailing or successful party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorneys fees and other costs incurred in such action.

 



 

(b) _Reverse Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ as a result of a Financing Termination, then the Buyer
shall pay $25,200,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") to the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within five (5)
Business Days following such termination) by wire transfer of same day funds.
In no event shall the Company be entitled to the Reverse Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. The Parties agree that the Reverse Termination Fee is
a liquidated damage and not a penalty and the payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and
sufficient consideration.

 



 

(ii) The Companys right to receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
from the Buyer shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the
Sellers, the Sellers Representative and their Affiliates against the Buyer,
the Debt Financing Sources or any of the Buyers or any Debt Financing
Sources former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents,
stockholders, representatives, Affiliates

 



      
 

 



 

or assignees or any former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder,
representative, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform under this
Agreement or otherwise and, upon payment of such amount, none of the Buyer,
the Debt Financing Sources or their respective Affiliates shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 11.2(b)(ii)_ shall limit the right of the Company (x) to bring
or maintain any claim, action or proceeding for injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to the extent provided in _Section
12.9_, unless the Company has terminated the Agreement pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(ii)_ and the Reverse Termination Fee has been paid in accordance with
_Section 11.3(b)(i)_, or (y) to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of a
breach of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ for any reason other than a Financing Termination,
then in lieu of any other remedies available to Sellers, Sellers may elect to
be paid the Reverse Termination Fee by providing notice in writing to Buyer
within five (5) business days of such termination of its election to receive
the Reverse Termination Fee. If Sellers so elect, Sellers waive any and all
other rights and remedies which Sellers may have as a result of the Buyers
default under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(ii)_, each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 11.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Buyer shall fail to pay
the Reverse Termination Fee when due, the Buyer shall reimburse the Company
for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred by the Company
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any
action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime rate in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made (as reported in the
Wall Street Journal) plus 5%, calculated on a daily basis from the date such
amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 12**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 12.1. _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. No Party shall issue
any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written

be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
immediately following the execution hereof, the Buyer and the Company will
jointly issue a press release announcing their entry into this Agreement and
(b) any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is
required by applicable Law, the SEC or any listing or trading agreement or the
rules and regulations of any securities exchange or automated securities
quotation system concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party

 



      
 

 



 

will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the SEC or any such listing
or trading agreement, rules or regulations, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to advise the other Parties prior to making the disclosure).

 



 

Section 12.2. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically provided
in _Section 11.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section 12.8(c)_ of this Agreement (with
respect to which each Debt Financing Source shall be a third-party
beneficiary) shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other
than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 12.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Documents, the
Confidentiality Agreement and all documents and certificates to be delivered

negotiations, understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the
Parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject
matter hereof.

 



 

Section 12.4. _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Buyer may, without the approval of any other Party to this
Agreement, but with prior notice to the Sellers Representative, assign this
Agreement and any or all rights, interests or obligations hereunder (including
the Buyers rights to purchase the Units and the Buyers rights to seek
indemnification hereunder) to any Affiliate of the Buyer and may make a
collateral assignment of this Agreement to any Person from which it has
borrowed money. If the Buyer assigns this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests or obligations hereunder, the Buyer shall remain liable to Sellers
and the Company for all of the Buyers obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to the
Buyer shall refer to such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

Section 12.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission and in a PDF transmitted by electronic
mail) in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original
but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.7. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other

domestic laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Illinois or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois.

AGAINST THE AGENTS, ARRANGERS OR LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS

NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY OR THE SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE, ON BEHALF OF THE
SELLERS, BE ENTITLED TO SEEK THE REMEDY OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES; _PROVIDED_ THAT NOTHING HEREIN
TO THE CONTRARY SHALL PROHIBIT (I) THE BUYER FROM ENFORCING ITS RIGHTS
DIRECTLY AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT OR

PERFORMANCE THEREUNDER) AND (II) THE COMPANY OR THE SELLERSS REPRESENTATIVE,
ON BEHALF OF THE SELLERS, FROM SEEKING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE PURSUANT TO
_SECTION 12.9_ TO CAUSE THE BUYER TO COMPLY WITH _SECTION 6.8_ (FINANCING).

 



 

Section 12.9. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in
the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money damages may be
inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that, subject to _Section 11.3(b)_ and
_Section 12.9(b)_, each Party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Each Party hereby waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing (or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance (or other equitable relief) to cause the Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including to
effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.4_), in each case on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, only in the
event that (i) the Buyer is required to complete the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at
the Closing, and (iii) the Buyer fails to complete the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.4_.

 



 

Section 12.10. _Reliance_.

 



 

(i) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative
shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction from all of the
Sellers signatory to this Agreement and the Representative Agreement and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Sellers. The Buyer shall be
fully protected in dealing with the Sellers Representative under this
Agreement and may rely upon the authority of the Sellers Representative to
act as the agent of the Sellers and the Buyer shall have no liability
whatsoever to the Sellers for any action or omission of the Buyer, taken in
reliance on the authority of the Sellers Representative. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any payment by the Buyer to the Sellers
Representative to the extent authorized under this Agreement shall be
considered a payment by the Buyer to the Sellers, and any consent, waiver and
amendment, modification or other action of the Sellers Representative under
this Agreement shall be considered the consent, waiver, amendment,
modification or other action of all the Sellers, as applicable. The
appointment of the Sellers Representative is coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable by any Seller in any manner or for any reason. This power
of attorney shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution,
disability, incapacity or other inability to act of the principal pursuant to
any applicable law. In furtherance of the foregoing, any reference herein to a
power of the Sellers under this Agreement, to be exercised or otherwise taken,
shall be a power vested in the Sellers Representative.

 



 

(ii) The Sellers Representative may retain a portion of the Purchase Price in
the amount of $100,000 in cash as a reserve against the payment of expenses
incurred in his capacity as Sellers Representative (the " _Sellers 
Representative Fund_"). Upon final distribution of funds from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, the Sellers Representative will distribute the amount remaining
in the Sellers Representative Fund in accordance with the provisions of the
Representative Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.11. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative; _provided_ that any
amendment of _Section 11.2(b)(ii)_, _Section 12.2_, _Section 12.8(c)_ or
this _Section 12.11_ shall require the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach
of warranty or

 



      
 

 



 

covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
such prior or subsequent occurrence.

 



 

Section 12.12. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance shall be invalid or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid or
unenforceable, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 12.13. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the
Buyer, the Company, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative will bear its
or his own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses and transfer
Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 12.14. _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.15. _Miscellaneous_. In the event that any restricted Buyer Common
Stock does not vest upon the terms set forth in the Restricted Stock
Agreements and the Buyer does not allocate any such restricted Buyer Common
Stock to any remaining Retention Employees on a pro rata basis among such
remaining Retention Employees, the Buyer shall, promptly after receipt of a
request from the Sellers Representative, deliver to the Sellers
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts specified by the Sellers Representative for distribution to the
Sellers in accordance with their respective Company Unit Ownership Percentages
or as set forth on the Sellers Allocation Schedule, an amount equal to the
product of (a) the number of shares of any such restricted Buyer Common Stock,
_multiplied by_ (b) the volume weighted average price of the Buyer Common
Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the twenty (20) trading days ending on
the third trading day prior to the Closing Date.
