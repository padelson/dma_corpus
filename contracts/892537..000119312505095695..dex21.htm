consent or waiver by the Company or the Buyer, Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton LLP (&#147;<B>SMRH</B>&#148;) shall be permitted to represent the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties and/or the Shareholder Representative after the Closing in
connection with any matter, including without limitation anything related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, SMRH
shall be permitted to represent the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties, the Shareholder Representative, any of their agents and affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute
(&#147;dispute&#148; includes litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Buyer, the Company or any of their agents or affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related
matter, such as claims for indemnification and disputes involving employment or noncompetition or other agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement. Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-client
relationship with SMRH, unless SMRH is specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent the Company after Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the
Shareholder Representative or the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the Shareholder Representative (as applicable) consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of the Company by SMRH after Closing shall not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof. For example, and not by way of limitation, even if SMRH is representing the Company after the Closing, SMRH shall be permitted simultaneously to represent the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties and/or the
Shareholder Representative in any matter, including any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Furthermore, SMRH shall be permitted to withdraw from any representation of the Company in order to be able to represent or continue so representing
the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the Shareholder Representative, even if such withdrawal causes the Company or Buyer additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel &#147;up to speed&#148;), delay or other prejudice. </FONT></P>
