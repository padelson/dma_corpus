Section 2.9 _Closing Net Worth Adjustment and Estimated Closing Net Worth
Adjustment_.



(a) The "Closing Net Worth Adjustment" shall be the positive or negative
difference, if any, by which the Closing Net Worth (as defined below) differs
from nineteen million one hundred thousand dollars ($19,100,000) (the "Pro
Forma Closing Net Worth"). If the Closing Net Worth exceeds the Pro Forma
Closing Net Worth, then the Closing Net Worth Adjustment shall be positive;
and if the Closing Net Worth is less than the Pro Forma Closing Net Worth,
then the Closing Net Worth Adjustment shall be negative. The Company shall
estimate in good faith the Closing Net Worth, as of Closing, and deliver (i)
such estimate, which shall include an unaudited balance sheet of the Company
as of a date within three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date that
(A) is prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with
and using all of the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies (which, in the case of judgments, shall be judgments consistent with
the applicable judgments made with respect to the Company Balance Sheet) used
in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet (the "Accounting Principles")
and (B) reflects balance sheet account balances consistent with average
balances of such accounts for September 2004 through March 2005 unless the
Company and Buyer agree otherwise, and (ii) copies of the working papers used
to prepare such estimate and unaudited balance sheet to Buyer, no later than
three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date (the difference between such
estimate and the Pro Forma Closing Net Worth, if any, being the "Estimated Net
Worth Adjustment"). As provided in Section 2.7(a) and subject to Section
2.9(c), the Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted for the Estimated Net
Worth Adjustment, if any. The Closing Net Worth shall be finally determined in
accordance with Section 2.9(b) and Section 2.10.



(b) Promptly after the Closing, Buyers independent accountants shall, at
Buyers expense (i) audit the books of account of the Company as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) prepare an audited balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and shall
be accompanied by an unqualified report of Buyers independent accountants on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet certifying that the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and any related notes thereto were prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. The



 

\- 20 - Merger Parties acknowledge that (A) the sole purpose of the determination of
Closing Net Worth is to adjust the Initial Purchase Price so as to reflect
the change in net worth of the Company from the Pro Forma Closing Net Worth to
the actual net worth of the Company on the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Closing Net Worth" shall mean the Companys assets as of the
Closing, _less_ the Companys Liabilities as of Closing, both as reflected on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, _increased by_ the aggregate amount of the
items reducing the Initial Purchase Price as set forth in Sections 2.7(a)
(i), (ii), (iii) and (v) and the amount of any corporate state Tax liability
solely attributable to a deemed asset sale arising by reason of any Code
Section 338(h)(10) election made by Buyer and the Shareholders, to the extent
the amount of such items is accrued and included on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet.



(c) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Estimated Net Worth Adjustment or Actual Net Worth Adjustment (as described in
Section 2.10(a) below), whether positive or negative, shall be made until and
unless the amount of any such adjustment exceeds One Hundred Thousand dollars
($100,000) (the "Adjustment Deductible"). If any Estimated Net Worth
Adjustment or any Actual Net Worth Adjustment shall exceed the Adjustment
Deductible, then the adjustment shall be made only to the extent the
adjustment exceeds the Adjustment Deductible. Further, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any actual adjustments, whether
positive or negative, made in excess of the Adjustment Deductible in
connection with the Estimated Net Worth Adjustment or the Actual Net Worth
Adjustment shall be limited, both individually and in the aggregate, to the
amount of One Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($1,500,000).



Section 2.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_.



(a) Buyer, based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall provide to the
Shareholder Representative, within sixty (60) days after Closing, (i) a copy
of the Closing Date Balance Sheet accompanied by the unqualified report of
Companys accountant as provided in Section 2.9(b), and (ii) a copy of
Buyers independent accountants calculation of (A) the actual Closing Net
Worth Adjustment, if any (the "Actual Net Worth Adjustment"); (B) the amount
by which, if any, Closing Net Worth exceeds the Pro Forma Closing Net Worth
and, in such case, the amount if any, by which a positive Estimated Net Worth
Adjustment is less than a positive Actual Net Worth Adjustment or the amount,
if any, by which a negative Estimated Net Worth Adjustment is greater than a
negative Actual Net Worth Adjustment or the spread, if any, between a negative
Estimated Net Worth Adjustment and a positive Actual Net Worth Adjustment (in
each such case, a "Shareholder Net Worth Adjustment"); and (C) the amount by
which, if any, Pro Forma Closing Net Worth exceeds Closing Net Worth and, in
such case, the amount, if any, by which a positive Estimated Net Worth
Adjustment is greater than a positive Actual Net Worth Adjustment or the
amount, if any, by which a negative Estimated Net Worth adjustment is less
than a negative Actual Net Worth adjustment or the spread, if any, between a
positive Estimated Net Worth Adjustment and a negative Actual Net Worth
Adjustment (in each such case, a "Buyer Net Worth Adjustment") (such
materials in item (ii) of this Section 2.10(a), the "Purchase Price Adjustment
Notice").



(b) Buyer, at the Shareholder Representatives request, shall allow the
Shareholder Representative and his or her representatives reasonable
access at all reasonable times to the Surviving Corporations and Companys
accountants, personnel, properties, Books



 

\- 21 - and Records, work papers, schedules and calculations directly relating to the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Actual Net Worth Adjustment, Buyer Net Worth
Adjustment, if any, and Shareholder Net Worth Adjustment, if any, for the
purpose of reviewing the Purchase Price Adjustment Notice and the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and confirming the accuracy of the preparation thereof. Any
Buyer Net Worth Adjustment or Shareholder Net Worth Adjustment shall be paid
within thirty (30) days of the Shareholder Representatives receipt of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Notice, except for any of the Buyer Net
Worth Adjustment or the Shareholder Net Worth Adjustment, as the case may be,
for which the Shareholder Representative has provided Buyer with a Shareholder
Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice (as subsequently defined) in good
faith. In the event that the Shareholder Representative provides such notice
("Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice") to Buyer no later
than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Purchase Price Adjustment Notice
that the Shareholders in good faith dispute Buyers independent accountants
determination of the Actual Net Worth Adjustment, if any, the Buyer Net Worth
Adjustment, if any, and/or the Shareholder Net Worth Adjustment, if any,
determined in accordance with Section 2.10(a), the Shareholder Representative
and Buyer shall then meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute,
such negotiation to begin as soon as practicable (but in any case, no later
than thirty (30) days) after Buyers receipt of the Shareholder Purchase
Price Adjustment Objection Notice.



(c) In the event that Buyer and the Shareholder Representative are not able to
resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date on which Buyer
receives the Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice, then
the Shareholder Representative and Buyer may refer the issues in dispute to a
neutral, mutually acceptable independent accounting firm of national
reputation with which no party hereto has had a preexisting relationship for
resolution (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Referee") and, immediately
thereafter, shall provide notice of such referral to the other Merger Parties.
If, within ten (10) days after the date on which Buyer received the
Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice, the parties are
unable to agree on a neutral accounting firm to act as Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee, (i) each party shall select a neutral accounting firm of
national reputation and such firms together shall select the neutral
accounting firm to act as the Purchase Price Adjustment Referee, and (ii) if
any party does not select a neutral accounting firm within ten (10) days of
written demand therefore by the other party, the independent neutral
accounting firm selected by the other party shall act as the Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee. The Purchase Price Adjustment Referee will only consider
those items and amounts as to which Buyer and Shareholder Representative have
disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above and must
resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The Merger Parties shall submit their positions on the dispute to
the Purchase Price Adjustment Referee within thirty (30) days after referral.
The Purchase Price Adjustment Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Shareholder
Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30)
days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of
any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Purchase Price Adjustment Referee shall select as a resolution
the position of either Buyer or Shareholder Representative for each item
of disagreement and may not impose an alternative resolution. The Purchase
Price Adjustment Referee shall make its determination based solely on
presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant
to any independent review. The determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Referee shall be final and binding upon Buyer and the Shareholders. The fees
and expenses of the Purchase Price



 

\- 22 - Adjustment Referee shall be shared equally by Buyer and the Shareholders.
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall direct the Purchase Price
Adjustment Referee to promptly provide invoices of all such fees and expenses
directly to the Shareholder Representative and Buyer. Any other costs incurred
by either party including, but not limited to, experts, attorneys or
financial advisors shall be at the sole cost of the party incurring such cost
regardless of the determination.



(d) On the applicable date referred to in Section 2.10(b) (with regard to
payments for which if there is no dispute) or within fifteen (15) Business
Days after final determination in accordance with this Section 2.10, either
(i) Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders their respective Pro Rata Interests of
the amount of any Shareholder Net Worth Adjustment, or (ii) the Shareholders
shall pay to Buyer the amount of any Buyer Net Worth Adjustment (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Interests). Any such payment is
hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Price Adjustment Final Payment." Any
Buyer Net Worth Adjustment shall be paid first from the Escrow Account (with
such payment being deducted from each Shareholders share of the Escrow Amount
on a pro rata basis in accordance with his or her Pro Rata Interest) and,
second, if the Escrow Amount is not sufficient to satisfy the Buyer Net Worth
Adjustment, by the Shareholders personally (as a several obligation in
proportion to the Shareholders Pro Rata Interests).



(e) Any Purchase Price Adjustment Final Payment shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds after its final determination in
accordance with this Section 2.10 to account(s) specified by Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, to receive the Purchase Price
Adjustment Final Payment; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required
to make any payment by wire transfer in an amount less than Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and may issue checks written against immediately
available funds in lieu of wire transfer for such payments.



Section 2.11 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.



(a) Each Shareholder shall join with Buyer in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and, at the request of Buyer, any analogous provision
of state or local law (each such election, a "Section 338 Election") with
respect to the purchase of the stock of the Company. On the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form(s)
thereto) executed by each Shareholder.



(b) Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders agree that the Purchase Price and
the Liabilities of the Company (plus other relevant items) will be allocated
to the assets of the Company in accordance with Code Sections 338 and 1060 and
the regulations thereunder and the provisions set forth in _Schedule 2.11(b)_
(attached hereto and made a part hereof) and Buyer, the Company and the
Shareholders shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims
for refund), IRS Form 8883 and any information reports in a manner consistent
therewith.



(c) The Shareholders shall include their pro rata share of any income, gain,
loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from the Section 338 Election on
their tax returns to the extent required by applicable law and Buyer shall
pay to Shareholders such additional amounts as may be payable pursuant to the
provisions of _Schedule 2.11(b)_.

Section 7.1 _Indemnification by the Shareholders_.



Subject to Section 7.3, the Shareholders severally, pro rata in accordance
with their Pro Rata Interests, shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer,
Merger Sub and Buyers Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Parties")
harmless from and against any and all Losses asserted against, imposed on, or
incurred or suffered by Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation as a result of (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or the
breach of any warranty set forth in Article III, any Company Disclosure
Schedule delivered by the Company in connection with Article III or in any
agreement or certificate executed and delivered by the Company or any
Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement; (b) the non-fulfillment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or any Shareholder set forth
in this Agreement or in any agreement or certificate executed and delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) any payments by or liabilities of Buyer
arising in connection with payments to holders of Dissenting Shares, in excess
of the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any
such Shareholder in connection with this Agreement (collectively,
"Indemnified Losses"). Each Shareholder irrevocably waives any and all rights
to recourse against the



 

\- 63 - Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any misrepresentation or
breach of any representation, warranty or indemnity, or noncompliance with
any conditions, covenants or agreements, given or made by the Company in this
Agreement. No Shareholder shall be entitled to contribution from, subrogation
to or recovery against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to any liability of such Shareholder that may arise under or pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 7.2 _Indemnification by Buyer and Merger Sub_.



Subject to Section 7.3, Buyer and Merger Sub shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold the Shareholders harmless from and against any
and all Losses asserted against, imposed on, or incurred or suffered by the
Shareholders as a result of (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or the
breach of any warranty set forth in Article IV, any Schedule delivered by
Buyer and/or Merger Sub in connection with Article IV or in any agreement or
certificate executed and delivered by Buyer or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement; or (b) the non-fulfillment of any material covenant or agreement on
the part of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in any
agreement or certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement.



Section 7.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Limitations on
Indemnification_.



(a) _Survival_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement and the
indemnification provisions in this Agreement with respect thereto shall
survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date,
at which time they shall terminate and no claim shall thereafter be brought in
respect of them; provided, however, that such termination shall not affect
any claim for breach of any representation or warranty if written notice
thereof, in reasonable detail, has been given to the breaching party prior to
such termination date (in such case, the survival period for the
representation and warranty shall continue until the claim is fully resolved).
The covenants of the parties set forth in this Agreement to be performed after
the Closing shall survive until performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing to
the contrary, the representations and warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.2(a),
3.2(c), 3.3, and 3.4 of this Agreement and the indemnification obligations of
the Shareholders with respect thereto and with respect to any claims for
fraud brought by the Buyer Parties against the Shareholders shall survive for
the longer of (i) one (1) year following the Closing Date or (ii) expiration
of the respective, applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, the representations and warranties in Section 3.22
of this Agreement and the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders with
respect thereto shall survive for three (3) years following the Closing Date.



(b) _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification from the Shareholders pursuant to this Article VII if the
amount of all Indemnified Losses incurred in the aggregate by the Buyer
Parties exceeds Fifty Thousand dollars ($50,000) (the "Deductible"). If the
aggregate amount of all Indemnified Losses incurred by the Buyer Parties
exceeds in the aggregate the Deductible, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification for all such Indemnified Losses in excess of the
Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation



 

\- 64 - and liability for any and all Indemnified Losses and any other indemnification
obligations set forth in this Agreement by the Shareholders shall not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Indemnification
Cap") and, subject to Section 7.3(c) the aggregate amount to be paid by a
Shareholder under this Article VII shall not exceed his or her Pro Rata
Interest as set forth on the Certificate of Share Ownership of an amount equal
to 15% of the Adjusted Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the
contrary, neither the Deductible nor the Indemnification Cap shall apply to
any claims for fraud or any claims for breach under Sections 3.1, 3.2(a),
3.2(c), 3.3, and 3.4, for which Buyer Parties rights to indemnification shall
be unlimited. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary the obligation
and liability for any and all Indemnified Losses relating to the breach of
Section 3.6(a) and/or Section 3.6(i) (and any other Tax-related
representation, warranty, or covenant under this Agreement, to the extent that
the circumstances giving rise to such breach also give rise to a breach of
Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(i)) shall be considered separately from all other
Indemnified Losses, and such amount shall not exceed Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the "Tax Indemnification Cap"). Any Losses from, and any
indemnification or recovery relating to, the breach of such Section 3.6(a) and
Section 3.6(i) (and any other Tax-related representation, warranty, or
covenant under this Agreement, to the extent that the circumstances giving
rise to such breach also give rise to a breach of Section 3.6(a) or 3.6(i))
shall be distinct from and considered separately from (and such Losses shall
not be included in) the aggregate amount of all Indemnified Losses
when giving effect to the provisions relating to the Indemnification Cap, and
the aggregate amount to be paid by a Shareholder with respect thereto shall
not exceed his or her Pro Rata Interest as set forth on the Certificate of
Share Ownership of the Tax Indemnification Cap.



(c) _Payment of Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the terms of this
Article VII and the terms of the Escrow Agreement, prior to Buyer Parties
proceeding against the Shareholders personally, any indemnification
obligations of the Shareholders under this Agreement shall be paid and
satisfied first from the Escrow Amount deposited with the Escrow Agent (with
such payments being deducted from each Shareholders share of the Escrow
Amount on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Pro Rata Interests) until
the earlier of (i) such time as the Escrow Amount is exhausted or (ii) the
release of the Escrow Amount as provided in the Escrow Agreement; provided,
however, that with respect to a breach of the obligations described in Section
5.13(a)-(d), Buyer Parties shall first proceed against the Restricted
Employee or Restricted Employees who breached the obligation, to fully recover
the resulting Losses determined without regard to any Indemnification Cap or
other limitation on liability set forth in Section 7.3(b), above, and only
after proceeding against such Restricted Employee in a court of law through
final judgment may, proceed against either the portion of the Escrow Amount
attributable to the other Shareholders Pro Rata Interests or against the
other Shareholders in satisfaction of the Losses subject to the
Indemnification Cap and other limitations set forth in this Article VII.



(d) _Insurance Proceeds_. An indemnified party shall reimburse the Shareholder
for amounts paid to the indemnified party by such Shareholder with respect to
a Loss pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the extent that such
indemnified party receives any insurance proceeds with respect to such Loss.



 

\- 65 - (e) _Mitigation_. Each party agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of conditions
giving rise to Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.



(f) _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to the indemnified party for an
indemnification claim hereunder, the indemnitor shall be subrogated to
the extent of such payment to any rights that the indemnified party may have
against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim.



(g) _Third Party Claims_. In calculating any Losses there shall be deducted
any indemnification, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered
by the indemnified party or any Affiliate thereof from any third Person with
respect thereto so long as such recovered claim has been finally determined
and is not subject to appeal.



(h) _Tax Benefit_. In calculating any Losses there shall be
deducted therefrom the amount of any Tax benefit or Tax refund actually
enjoyed or actually received by the applicable indemnified party or any
Affiliate thereof as a result of such Losses provided, however, that such Tax
benefit shall be calculated net of any Tax paid or payable in connection with
any actual or reasonably anticipated recovery of all or some of such Losses.



(i) No Shareholder shall have liability to Buyer under any provision of this
Agreement for any Losses to the extent that such Losses arise solely
and directly from any intentional actions outside the ordinary course of
business taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Company after the Closing Date.



(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 



(i) If the Shareholders may have an indemnification obligation under this
Agreement with respect to a Loss arising out of or relating to environmental
laws or hazardous substances (an "Environmental Loss"), the Shareholder
Representative at its own expense shall have the right to enter into the
facilities and to control, direct and implement any environmental
investigation, monitoring, remediation, abatement, excavation or other
response or removal action relating to such Environmental Loss.



(ii) To the extent that the Shareholders may have an indemnification
obligation under this Agreement with respect to an Environmental Loss, Buyer
shall not be entitled to claim or seek indemnity or defense under this
Agreement with respect thereto to the extent that such Environmental Loss
would not have arisen but for any intrusive investigation or disclosure by
Buyer or any Affiliate thereof, unless such investigation or disclosure was
required by applicable Environmental Laws.



(k) Indemnified Losses shall not include any special, exemplary or punitive
damages, and neither the Shareholders nor the Buyer Parties shall be liable
for any special, exemplary or punitive damages under this Agreement, except to
the extent that such special, exemplary or punitive are asserted by a Third
Party.



 

\- 66 - Section 7.4 _Escrow Account_.



(a) _Deposit of Funds into Escrow Account_. As security for the indemnity
provided for in Section 7.1, at the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit into
the Escrow Account, on behalf of the Shareholders, the Escrow Amount, as
contemplated by Section 2.7(c). In the event that the Shareholders shall owe
an indemnification obligation to Buyer Parties, Buyer Parties shall be
permitted to seek satisfaction of such obligation through an offset against
the Escrow Amount. No limitation of such right of offset shall otherwise
affect a Buyer Partys rights hereunder or otherwise. The remedy of offset
shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or
other rights or remedies to which Buyer Parties are or may be entitled, at law
or equity, under this Agreement.



(b) _Escrow Period; Final Distribution From the Escrow Account_. Subject to
the following requirements, the Escrow Account shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
Washington, D.C. time, on the fifth (5th) day following the Escrow Termination
Date; provided that the Escrow Account shall not terminate on such date with
respect to such remaining portion of the Escrow Amount (or some portion
thereof) that in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, subject to the objection
of the Shareholder Representative and the subsequent arbitration of the matter
in the manner provided in Section 7.5, is necessary to satisfy (i) any then
pending unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered
to the Escrow Agent by Buyer prior to the Escrow Termination Date, and (ii)
any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the
Escrow Agent by Buyer prior to the Escrow Termination Date with respect to
facts and circumstances existing prior to the Escrow Termination Date. After
the Escrow Termination Date and as soon as all such claims have been resolved,
the Escrow Agent shall distribute funds from the Escrow Account sufficient to
satisfy the expenses of the Shareholder Representative in connection with the
Escrow Account and shall thereafter deliver to the Shareholders ratably in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Interests as set forth on the
Certificate of Share Ownership hereto the remaining portion of the Escrow
Account not required to satisfy such claims and expenses.



Section 7.5 _Method of Asserting Claims_.



All claims for indemnification by a party entitled to be indemnified hereunder
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:



(a) _Claims by Buyer Parties_. In the event a Buyer Party has a claim for an
Indemnified Loss against the Shareholders hereunder which does not involve a
claim being asserted against or sought to be collected by a third party (a
"Buyer Claim"), Buyer Parties shall promptly notify the
Shareholder Representative in writing of such claim specifying the nature of
the claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
claim) (the "Claim Notice"). If the Shareholder Representative does not
dispute all or any part the Buyer Claim in a written notice delivered to the
Buyer within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility for the
undisputed Buyer Claims set forth in such notice and shall have no further
right to contest such undisputed Buyer Claims. Buyer may proceed to collect
the undisputed amount of the Buyer Claim from the Escrow 



 

\- 67 - Account as set forth in Sections 7.5(b) or 7.5(c), and then collect the
undisputed amount of the Buyer Claim from the Shareholders. If the
Shareholder Representative disputes any portion of a Buyer Claim in writing in
accordance with this Section 7.5(a), the parties shall attempt to resolve such
dispute in accordance with Section 7.5(d).



(b) _Claims Upon Escrow Account_. In accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the
Escrow Termination Date of a certificate signed by any officer of Buyer (an
"Officers Certificate"): (i) stating that Buyer has paid or properly accrued
or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Indemnified
Losses subject to indemnification by the Shareholders, and (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Indemnified Losses included in the
amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or
the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
misrepresentations, breach of warranty or covenant to which such items are
related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5(c),
be directed to distribute to Buyer from the Escrow Account as promptly as
practicable, funds in an amount equal to such Indemnified Losses.



(c) _Objections to Claims_. At the time of delivery of any Officers
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall
be delivered by Buyer to the Shareholder Representative and for a period of
thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no
distribution to Buyer of any funds contained in the Escrow Account pursuant
to Section 7.5(b) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Shareholder Representative to make such distribution.
After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall be
directed to distribute funds from the Escrow Account in accordance with
Section 7.5(b), provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if the
Shareholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim
made in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day
period.



(d) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.



     | (i) | In case the Shareholder Representative shall so object in
writing to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate or any Claim
Notice, Buyer shall have ten (10) days to respond in a written statement to
the objection of the Shareholder Representative. If after such ten (10)-day
period, there remains a dispute as to any such claim, the parties shall
attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholder
Representative and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by the Shareholder Representative and
Buyer, and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. In the event that the
Buyer Parties have elected to offset any such claim against the Escrow Amount
pursuant to an Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms thereof. 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 68 - negotiation, either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Shareholder Representative,
on the other, may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the
damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative. In the event that within forty-five
(45) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Buyer and
the Shareholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, Buyer
and the Shareholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the
two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator to handle the
dispute. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitration will be
governed by Virginia procedural law as if the matter had been brought in a
Circuit Court of the State of Virginia; provided, however, that (i) the
parties waive any right to jury; (ii) there shall be no interlocutory
appellate relief (such as writs) available; and (iii) discovery will be
limited to matters which are directly relevant to the issues in the
arbitration; provided, however, that in any case where the damage or loss at
issue includes any claim for Losses in the nature of consequential damages
(including lost profit) all three arbitrators so chosen shall handle the
dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or
equity, should the arbitrator(s) determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. To appeal the judgment of the arbitrator, a
party must follow all of the prerequisites for appealing a judgment of the
Circuit Court, directing all such prerequisites to the American Arbitration
Association (the "Arbitration Administrator") in lieu of the clerk. All
appeals will be made to 3 neutral arbitrators ("Appellate Arbitrators")
selected in accordance with the procedures set forth above. The
Appellate Arbitrators will conduct a hearing, review the judgment of the
arbitrator, and issue an appellate decision applying the same standards of
review (and all of the same presumptions) as if the Appellate Arbitrators were
judges of the Virginia Court of Appeal reviewing a judgment of the Circuit
Court. The Appellate Arbitrators will be vested with the same powers as a
Virginia Court of Appeal (including the power to remand a matter to an
arbitrator). The decision of the Appellate Arbitrators as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate or Claim Notice shall be
binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement (unless remanded to

\- 69 - elected to offset any such claim against the Escrow Amount, notwithstanding
anything in Section 7.5(b) or (c) to the contrary, Buyer and Shareholder
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to act in accordance with such
decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Account in accordance
therewith. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Judgment upon any award rendered by the Appellate
Arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such
arbitration shall be held in Fairfax, Virginia under the rules then in effect
of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall determine how
all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including the
respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and
the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association. 
---|---|--- 



(e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Buyer becomes aware of a third-party
claim which Buyer believes may result in a demand against the Shareholders (or
the Escrow Amount) (a "ThirdParty Claim"), Buyer shall promptly provide a
Claim Notice to the Shareholder Representative with respect to such
ThirdParty Claim. The Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the
Shareholders, at the Shareholders sole cost and expense has the right,
exercisable by written notice to Buyer within thirty (30) days after receipt
of a Claim Notice from Buyer with respect to a Third-Party Claim, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and reasonably acceptable to Buyer
and to assume, control, defend against, negotiate and otherwise deal with any
proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any Indemnified Loss with
respect to such Thirty-Party Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in
this Agreement; provided, however, that the (i) defense of such Third-Party
Claim by the Shareholder Representative is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer; (ii) the Thirty-Party Claim solely seeks
(and continues to seek) monetary damages; and (iii) Shareholder
Representative expressly agrees in writing that as between the Shareholders
and Buyer, the Shareholders may only satisfy and discharge the Third-Party
Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement
(the "Litigation Conditions"). Buyer may participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim which the Shareholder Representative is defending as
provided in this Section 7.5(e) with counsel of Buyers choice and at its
expense. If the Shareholder Representative does not assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section 7.5(e), Buyer shall have the
right to control such defense. If the Shareholder Representative has assumed
the defense of a Thirty-Party Claim as provided in this Section 7.5(e), the
Shareholders will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred
by Buyer in connection with the defense of the Thirty-Party Claim; provided,
however, that if (i) any of the Litigation Conditions ceases to be met or
(ii) the Shareholder Representative fails to take reasonable steps necessary
to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim or abandons the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, Buyer may assume its own defense and the Shareholders will
be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection
with such defense. The party controlling the defense of such Third-Party Claim
shall keep the other party advised of the



 

\- 70 - status of such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in
good faith the recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto.
Neither Buyer nor the Shareholder Representative shall have the right to
settle any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the other, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the
consent of the Buyer shall not be required if (i) any amounts payable pursuant
to such settlement or compromise do not exceed the Escrow Amount, (ii) such
settlement includes a complete written release of the Buyer from all liability
with respect to such Third-Party Claim and does not impose any injunctive or
equitable relief or other operational restrictions on the Buyer, and (iii) is
not reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on the affected business of
Buyer or its Affiliates; and, in case of any such settlement, the Shareholder
Representative shall execute and deliver a memorandum to the Escrow Agent
indicating the amount of such settlement, which memorandum may be relied upon
by the Escrow Agent to offset the amount of such settlement against the
Escrow Account. Except to the extent provided in the preceding sentence, no
settlement of any such Third-Party Claim shall be determinative of the amount
of any claim against the Shareholders or the Escrow Account. The parties
agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or demand. In
the event that the Shareholder Representative has consented to settlement of
a Third-Party Claim pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.5(e),
neither the Shareholder Representative or the Shareholders shall have the
power or authority to object to the amount of any claim by Buyer against the
Escrow Account or the Shareholders in the amount of such settlement.



(f) _Claims by Shareholders_. In the event that the Shareholders have a claim
against a Buyer Party hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing of such claim specifying the nature of such claim and
the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim). If the
Buyer does not notify the Shareholder Representative within sixty (60) days of
receipt of such notice that Buyer Parties dispute such claim, the amount of
such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Buyer Parties
hereunder. In case an objection is made in writing in accordance with this
Section 7.5(f), the Shareholder Representative shall have ten (10) days to
respond in a written statement to the objection of the Buyer Parties. If after
such ten (10)-day period there remains a dispute as to any claim, the parties
shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the parties
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by Buyer and Shareholder Representative. If no such agreement can
be reached after good faith negotiation, the parties may demand an arbitrator
to settle such dispute in the same manner set forth in Section 7.5(d)(ii)
above.



Section 7.6 _Remedies_.



Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, this Article VII sets forth
the sole exclusive remedy and recourse of the parties for monetary
damages arising from any claim, cause of action or right of any nature under
this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Article VII
shall be in lieu of, or constitute a waiver of, any nonmonetary equitable
remedies for injunctive relief, specific performance or rescission that any
party may otherwise have.



 

\- 71 - ARTICLE VIII __



_TAX MATTERS_



Section 8.1 _Tax Returns_.



(a) _Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date_. The Shareholder
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be filed all state and federal income or franchise Tax Returns for
the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date which are
filed after the Closing Date (the "Short Period Returns"). The Short Period
Returns shall be prepared and filed in accordance with historic practices and
procedures of the Company and applicable law, based on a closing of the books
of Company as of immediately before the Closing. The Shareholder
Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Surviving
Corporation from funds comprising the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the
portion of Company Taxes reported on such Tax Returns that relate to the
portion of such taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that were
not paid before the Closing Date or that were not reserved for on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income), except to the
extent that such Taxes are allowable and recoverable costs for inclusion in
the costs of agreements with Governmental Entities. Prior to filing any Short
Period Return, the Shareholder Representative shall afford the Buyer a
reasonable opportunity to review the proposed form of any Short Period Return
and comment thereon.



(b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation shall file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns
of the Company for tax periods that begin before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period" and such Tax Returns, a "Straddle
Period Return") and pay all Taxes owed by the Company for such periods. Prior
to Filing any Straddle Period Return, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall afford the Shareholder Representative a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the proposed form of any Straddle Period Return. The
Shareholder Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Surviving Corporation from funds comprising the Escrow Amount within fifteen
(15) days after the date on which such Taxes are paid with respect to such
periods an amount equal to the portion of such Company Taxes that relate to
the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date that were not
paid before the Closing Date or that were not reserved for on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, except to the extent that such Taxes are allowable and
recoverable costs for inclusion in the costs of agreements with Governmental
Entities. For purposes of this Section 8.1(b), in the case of any Taxes that
are payable by the Company for any Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax
payable by the Company which relates to the portion of such taxable period
ending on the day before the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on
the day before the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon
or related to income or receipts be equal to the amount which would be
payable by the Company if the relevant taxable period ended on the day before
the Closing Date (which shall include amount of any Tax solely attributable to
a deemed asset sale arising by reason of any Code Section 338(h)(10) election
made by Buyer and the



 

\- 72 - Shareholders). All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Company (taking into account (i) the Tax status of the Company for such
period, including its Subchapter S corporation status for federal income tax
purposes and any similar status for other Tax purposes, and (ii) Taxes that
are allowable costs and recoverable for inclusion in the costs of agreements
with Governmental Entities).



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b),
Buyer shall pay, when due, to the relevant state Tax authorities on behalf
of the Company the amount of any state income or franchise Taxes as shown on
any Short Period Return or Straddle Period Return solely attributable to a
deemed asset sale arising by reason of any Code Section 338(h)(10) election
made by Buyer and the Shareholders up to an aggregate maximum of five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000). To the extent that the aggregate amount of state
income or franchise Taxes as shown on any Short Period Return or Straddle
Period Return solely attributable to a deemed asset sale arising by reason of
any Code Section 338(h)(10) election made by Buyer and the Shareholders exceed
five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), then the Shareholder Representative,
in its sole discretion, shall determine the amount and jurisdictions to which
its payments shall be made.



Section 8.2 _Certain Contest Rights_.



(a) Promptly after receipt by Buyer, the Company or any Shareholder of a
written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, either at such time
or after the lapse of time, might give rise to an adjustment or audit of any
Tax Return of the Company for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
("Shareholder Returns"), or Straddle Period Returns, the party receiving such
notice shall notify the other parties hereunder (the "Tax Claim Notice"). The
Tax Claim Notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to
the party receiving the inquiry or notice from the taxing authority)
describing such demand, claim or circumstance, including any asserted tax
liability (an "Asserted Tax Claim") in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received in respect of any such
Asserted Tax Claim.



(b) Subject to Buyers right to participate in any tax proceeding as described
below, the Shareholder Representative, at its own cost and expense, shall
have the power and authority (i) to control the conduct of the Company in
respect of any Asserted Tax Claim to the extent it relates to any Shareholder
Return, any Taxes with respect to which the Shareholders have an obligation to
indemnify the Buyer pursuant to Article VII (the costs of any such audit or
examination shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation up to $50,000 (so long
as Buyer is permitted to fully participate in such proceedings) until the
issuance of a notice of deficiency; the costs of any such audit or
examination in excess of $50,000 and the costs of any administrative appeal or
litigation after the issuance of a notice of deficiency shall be borne by
Shareholders), (ii) to determine whether and to what extent to amend any
Shareholder Return (including any Short Period Return), and (iii) whether and
to what extent the Company shall extend or waive any statute of limitations
for the assessment of any Tax with respect to any Shareholder Return.
Buyer shall have the right to participate in any Asserted Tax Claim
proceedings such tax audit, examination, appeal or litigation (collectively, a
Asserted Tax Claim Proceeding") at Buyers sole expense, and, notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, to jointly control with



 

\- 73 - the Shareholder Representative any such tax proceeding if the amount claimed
by the taxing authority in a notice of deficiency would result in a liability
to the Company that exceeds the Escrow Amount or, if the resolution of the
matter at issue in such tax proceeding could materially adversely affect the
Surviving Corporation with respect to any period after the Closing. In no
event shall the Shareholder Representative settle any such tax proceeding
without Buyers consent if such settlement would materially adversely affect
the Company with respect to any period after the Closing or result in
any material liability on the part of the Company or such successor in
interest for which the Shareholder Parties are not obligated to indemnify the
Buyer pursuant to Article VII or Article VIII of this Agreement. If Buyer
withholds its consent to any proposed settlement to any Asserted Tax Claim (a
"Proposed Settlement"), then each such Shareholders liability with respect to
the subject matter of the Proposed Settlement shall be limited to the amount
that such liability would have been if the Proposed Settlement had been
accepted and the Buyer shall be responsible for all expenses incurred
thereafter in connection with the contest of such tax audit or proceeding
except to the extent that the final settlement imposes less liability on such
Shareholder than the Proposed Settlement would have imposed (taking into
account such Shareholders share of such expenses).



 

(c) Subject to the Shareholder Representatives right to participate in any
tax proceeding as described below, the Buyer, at its own cost and expense,
shall have the power and authority (i) to control the conduct of the Company
in respect of any Asserted Tax Claim to the extent it relates to any Straddle
Period Return., (ii) to determine whether and to what extent to amend any
Straddle Period Return, and (iii) whether and to what extent the Company
shall extend or waive any statute of limitations for the assessment of any Tax
with respect to any Straddle Period Return. The Shareholder Representative
shall have the right to participate in any Asserted Tax Claim Proceedings at
its sole expense, and, notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, to
jointly control with the Buyer any such tax proceeding if the amount claimed
by the taxing authority in a notice of deficiency could materially adversely
effect the Shareholders. In no event shall the Buyer settle any such tax
proceeding without the Shareholder Representatives consent if such settlement
would materially adversely affect the Shareholders. If the Shareholders
Representative withholds its consent to any Proposed Settlement, then the
Shareholders shall indemnify the Buyer for all expenses incurred thereafter in
connection with such Asserted Tax Claim Proceeding except to the extent
that the final settlement imposes less liability on the Company than the
Proposed Settlement would have imposed (taking into account Buyers share of
such expenses).



Section 8.3 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.



Each party hereto will provide each other with such cooperation and
information as any of them may reasonably request of the other in filing any
Tax Return of the Company, amended return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes of the Company or a right to a refund of Taxes of the
Company or in conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes
of the Company. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
copies of relevant Tax Returns of the Company or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules and related work papers and documents that are
reasonably relevant to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities.
Each party shall make its representatives available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide explanation of any documents or information provided
hereunder. The Company, its Shareholders, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
agree (A) to retain all Books



 

\- 74 - and Records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the
Shareholders, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall give the
Shareholder Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any Books and Records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before or
on the Closing Date and, if the Shareholder Representative so requests, Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation shall allow the Shareholder Representative to
take possession of such Books and Records.



Section 8.4 _Refunds_.



In the event that the Shareholders receive a refund or credit of Tax of
the Company for which the Buyer or the Company made a payment pursuant to
Section 8.2 or any other provision of this Agreement, then the Shareholders
shall promptly pay to the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, the amount
of such refund (including any accrued interest paid in respect of such
refunded Tax) or credit to the extent the refund or credit represents payments
made by or for the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with respect to events
occurring after the Closing Date. Each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall agree jointly and severally that, as a condition to receiving any such
refund or credit, in the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a
payment has been made to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
Section 8.4 is subsequently reduced or disallowed, to indemnify and hold
harmless the payor for any Tax liability assessed against such payor by reason
of the reduction or disallowance.

ARTICLE X



_SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE AND ESCROW AGENT_



Section 10.1 _The Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative_.



(a) Any provision in this Agreement that grants rights or remedies to the
Shareholders shall be deemed to be for the joint and several benefit of the
Shareholders, unless otherwise specifically provided. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to conclusively rely as to any obligation they may have hereunder to the
Shareholders upon any written instruction, waiver, notice, request, demand
or other communication delivered by or on behalf of the Shareholders by the
Shareholder Representative.



(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have full power and authority to make
all decisions on behalf of the Shareholders relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All decisions and actions by the
Shareholder Representative relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be binding upon all Shareholders and no Shareholder
shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the
same. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, as a material
inducement to Buyer to enter into this transaction, the Shareholder
Representative is irrevocably constituted and appointed as the true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of each Shareholder with full powers of
substitution to act in the name, place and stead of each Shareholder in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement such
appointment to be a power coupled with an interest which shall survive the
death or incapacity of any Shareholder. Each Shareholder irrevocably
authorizes Buyer and Merger Sub to rely on all acts and communications taken
or made by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Shareholders or
any of them pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, the related
agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



 

\- 77 - (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Shareholder Representative shall have no duties or responsibilities except
those expressly set forth herein and in the Shareholder Release Agreements,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities on behalf of the Company or any Shareholder shall otherwise exist
against the Shareholder Representative. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall have no duties or
responsibilities to Buyer or its Affiliates.



(d) The Shareholder Representative shall promptly deliver to each
Shareholder any notice received by the Shareholder Representative concerning
this Agreement.



(e) Neither the Shareholder Representative nor any agent employed by the
Shareholder Representative shall be liable to any Shareholder relating to the
performance of such Shareholder Representatives duties under this Agreement
for any errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise
except to the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent
jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not
taken by the Shareholder Representative constituted fraud or were taken or
not taken in bad faith. The Shareholder Representative shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Shareholders against all losses, including costs of
defense, paid or incurred in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or
claim to which the Shareholder Representative is made a party by reason of the
fact that the Shareholder Representative was acting as the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder
to the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent jurisdiction by
clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not taken by the
Shareholder Representative constituted actual fraud or were taken or not taken
in bad faith. The Shareholder Representative shall be protected in acting upon
any notice, statement or certificate believed by the
Shareholder Representative to be genuine and to have been furnished by the
appropriate Person and in acting or refusing to act in good faith on any
matter. Neither the Shareholder Representative nor any agent employed by the
Shareholder Representative shall be liable to the Buyer or any Affiliate of
the Buyer by reason of this Agreement or the performance of Shareholder
Representatives duties hereunder or otherwise.



(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the initial Shareholder Representative
shall be Harry M. Howton. In the event of the resignation, death or
incapacity of Harry M. Howton, the duties of the Shareholder Representative
shall be performed by a three (3) person committee consisting of Marshall A.
Goodwin, Ronald Jones and Joseph G. Swick ("Shareholders Committee"). In the
event that any individual authorized hereunder as a Shareholders Committee
member shall die, become incapacitated, resign or otherwise fail to act on
behalf of the Shareholders for any reason, a new individual shall be
appointed to the committee by action or written consent of Shareholders who
held immediately prior to the Closing Date no less than fifty-one percent
(51%) of the Company Common Stock (other than shares held in the Companys
treasury), and if none is so selected within thirty (30) days, then the
Shareholders Committee shall be reduced by one member. The unanimous vote of
the Shareholders Committee members shall constitute the act of the
Shareholders Committee. Upon formation, the Shareholders Committee shall
designate one member as the notice recipient and furnish such members contact
information to Buyer. Thereafter, in each case under this Agreement whereby
Buyer is required to notify, contact or otherwise provide



 

\- 78 - information or documents to the Shareholder Representative, such requirement
shall be satisfied by Buyers notification, contact or provision of
information or documents to the designated Shareholders Committee member.
Notwithstanding the formation of the Shareholders Committee, nothing in this
Section 10.1(f) shall allow any extension or delay in the period of time that
the Shareholders Representative is required to respond or otherwise act as
set forth in this Agreement.



Section 10.2 _Escrow Agent and Agreement_.



(a) The Shareholders, the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub hereby agree that the
Escrow Agent shall serve as an escrow agent to receive, hold, administer, and
deliver the Escrow Funds and the proceeds thereunder in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. Any interest accruing on, and other earnings on investment
of, the Escrow Funds shall be deemed to be a part of the Escrow Funds. The
Shareholders shall include all amounts earned on the Escrow Funds in their
gross incomes for federal, state and local income tax purposes and pay any
income tax imposed thereon. Any loss or expense incurred as a result of an
investment will be borne by the Escrow Funds. The parties recognize and agree
that the Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice
relating to either the investment of the Escrow Funds or the purchase, sale,
retention or other disposition of any investment. The Escrow Agreement will
direct the Escrow Agent to send statements to each of the Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the
Escrow Account for the preceding month.



(b) All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties shall be
paid by Buyer in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow
Agent. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly
fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated by this
Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent
is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow
Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated
for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees,
including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and occasioned by such default,
delay, controversy or litigation ("Special Escrow Agent Costs"). Buyer
promises to pay these sums upon demand. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated herein, the Shareholders, and not the Buyer, shall be
responsible for all Special Escrow Agent Costs that are incurred by the
Escrow Agent as a result of a situation or dispute in which it is determined
that the Shareholders were chiefly at fault.

Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the Shareholder Representative or
the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the Shareholder Representative
(as applicable) consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Company by SMRH after Closing shall not affect the
foregoing provisions hereof. For example, and not by way of limitation, even
if SMRH is representing the Company after the Closing, SMRH shall be permitted

the Shareholder Representative in any matter, including any disagreement or
dispute relating thereto. Furthermore, SMRH shall be permitted to withdraw
from any representation of the Company in order to be able to represent or
continue so representing the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the
Shareholder Representative, even if such withdrawal causes the Company or
Buyer additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel "up to speed"),
delay or other prejudice.
