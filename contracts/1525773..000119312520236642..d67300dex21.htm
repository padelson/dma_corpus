aircraft on the ATG Network (any such actions, &#147;<U>Network Management Actions</U>&#148;); provided, however, that Gogo may not engage in any Network Management Actions that would prioritize its customers over the customers of Buyer CA. To

(2)&nbsp;indemnify Buyer CA for any penalties payable by Buyer CA to the applicable airline to the extent such penalties result from any breach by Gogo of its obligations under the applicable SLA, provided that Gogo shall not be liable for any
penalties or damages arising from or relating to third-party hardware or third-party service providers (the obligations in clauses (1)&nbsp;and (2) of this sentence collectively, the &#147;<U>SLA Obligations</U>&#148;). For clarity, Gogo&#146;s SLA
Obligations shall extend to any renewals or extensions of agreements with existing airline customers of the Business as of the Closing that are entered into during the term of the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. If Buyer CA wishes to enter into a new

confirmed by Gogo&#146;s express written consent), Gogo&#146;s SLA Obligations shall also extend to such customer. With respect to any such new airline customer, Buyer CA and Gogo shall negotiate in good faith to make appropriate modifications to
pricing or other terms in the ATG Network Agreement to accommodate any increased performance requirements. If Buyer CA wishes to enter into a SLA that is more favorable to an airline in respect of the ATG Services than the terms of the
Business&#146; existing SLA obligations (a &#147;<U>Modified SLA</U>&#148;), Buyer CA may request that Gogo amend the terms of its SLA to backstop the Modified SLA and propose appropriate modifications to pricing or other terms in the ATG Network
Sharing Agreement, but Gogo will be under no obligation to agree to any such amendment. Buyer CA may not offer (and Gogo&#146;s SLA Obligations shall not apply to) any
