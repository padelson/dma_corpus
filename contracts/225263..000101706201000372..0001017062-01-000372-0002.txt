                                  ARTICLE II

            MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; ESCROW

     SECTION 2.01. Merger Consideration. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
                   --------------------
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities, subject to the other
provisions of this Article II:

                 (i)   each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company
     Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii)) shall be
     converted into and represent the right to receive the number of shares of
     Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section
     11.02(a)) (the "Merger Consideration");
                     --------------------

                 (ii)  each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any
     direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
     without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
     with respect thereto; and

                 (iii) each share of common stock, no par value per share, of
     the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully
     paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of
     the Surviving Corporation.

           (b) If, during the period between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, any change in the capital stock of Parent shall occur by reason of
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period or any similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted.

     SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Procedures.  At the
                   ------------------------      -------------------
Closing, the Company shall surrender to Parent all certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock, together with such other customary documents as
may reasonably be required by Parent, and which were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a).  Upon the
surrender of each Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to Parent:

                 (i)  the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
     entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
     Consideration, less the portion of the Merger Consideration which is to be
     held in escrow pursuant to Section 2.04 below, plus the amount of cash in
     lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to
     receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II; and

                                       3
<PAGE>

                 (ii)  the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall
     forthwith be cancelled.

     Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, each Company Stock
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon surrender the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

           (b) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent
               ----------------------------------------------------------
Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
------------
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock comprising part of the Merger
Consideration with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(d),
until the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.02.

           (c) No Further Rights in Company Stock. All cash and shares of Parent
               ----------------------------------
Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.02(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

           (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
               --------------------
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Company Stock Certificates, and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Parent. Each holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
fractional share interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled
by (ii) the Parent Share Value.

           (e) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
               ------------
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of
Company Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or
cash properly and legally delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

           (f) Lost Certificates. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
               -----------------
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Company Stock Certificate, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such person is entitled pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II.

     SECTION 2.03. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
                   --------------------
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding

                                       4
<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law.

      SECTION 2.04. Escrow. Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, each of
                    ------
the Shareholders and Parent shall enter into an escrow agreement (the "Escrow
                                                                       ------
Agreement") with an escrow agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
---------
the Shareholders (the "Escrow Agent") substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.04
                       ------------
hereto.  Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at the Closing, Parent
will deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent certificates representing ten
percent of the Merger Consideration (the "Escrow Shares") on a pro rata basis in
                                          -------------
accordance with each Shareholder's percentage ownership of Company Common Stock.
The shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to
this Section 2.04 are collectively referred to as the "Escrow Fund".  The Escrow
                                                       -----------
Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to
the terms thereof and shall be available for the purpose of securing the
indemnification obligations of the Shareholders set forth in Article IX and the
Escrow Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

Parent and the Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company and the Shareholders hereby
 ---------------------------
severally, and not jointly, represent and warrant to Parent and the Merger Sub
that the statements in this Article III are true and correct. The qualifications
or exceptions set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to

duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of California and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such corporate power and authority have not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and
in good standing that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has no subsidiaries and does not own, of record or beneficially, any
direct or indirect equity or other interest, or any right (contingent or
otherwise) to acquire the same, in any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
association or other entity. The Company is not a member of (nor is any part of
the Company's business conducted through) any partnership, nor is the Company a
participant in any joint venture or similar arrangement.

all preemptive rights. As of the date hereof there are outstanding: (i) no
shares of Capital Stock or other voting securities of the Company; (ii) no
securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
shares of Capital Stock or other securities of the Company; (iii) no options,

 ------------------
other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party or by which
it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of Capital
Stock of the Company.  There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of the
Company.  There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to

(other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of this Agreement by the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock, and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by California Law).  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject

constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default)

cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any
property or asset of the Company pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation, except for, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
above, such conflicts, violations, defaults or rights as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or to impair materially the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

           (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification

laws, (iii) for the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by California Law and (iv) where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or delay materially the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

interfere with the use of his or her best efforts to carry out his or her duties
for the Company or to promote the interests of the Company or that would

independent contractors and consultants of the Company and the conduct of the
business of the Company as presently conducted and proposed to be conducted,

and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or
public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.

         (b)  Such Shareholder understands that (i) the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued to such Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement have not been
registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom,
that they must be held by it indefinitely, and that it must, therefore, bear the
economic risk of such investment indefinitely, unless a subsequent disposition
thereof is registered under the Securities Act or is exempt from such
registration; (ii) in the event the California Permit is not issued and
effective as of the Effective Time, each certificate representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to such Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement
will be endorsed with the following legend:

    "THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
    THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, (THE "SECURITIES ACT") AND MAY NOT
    BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
    EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT COVERING SUCH
    SECURITIES OR IF THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE HOLDER
    OF THESE SECURITIES REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, STATING THAT
    SUCH SALE, TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT OR HYPOTHECATION IS EXEMPT FROM THE
    REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT."

and (iii) in the event the California Permit is not issued and effective as of
the Effective Time, Parent will instruct any transfer agent not to register the
transfer of any of the Parent Common Stock unless the conditions specified in
the foregoing legend (if applicable) are satisfied; provided, however, that no
such opinion of counsel shall be necessary if the sale, transfer or assignment
is made pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 144 and the
Shareholder provides Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
its counsel that the proposed transaction satisfies the requirements of Rule
144.  Parent agrees to remove the foregoing legend from any securities if the
requirements of SEC Rule 144(k) (or any successor rule or regulation) apply with
respect to such securities and Parent and its counsel are provided with
reasonably satisfactory evidence that the requirements of Rule 144(k) apply.

         (c)   Such Shareholder has not been offered the Parent Common Stock by
any form of advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in
any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio,

Permit is not issued and effective as of the Effective Time, the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued to such Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement

involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations
such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act,

with SEC Rule 144, as presently in effect, and understands the resale
limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.

its accounting methods, principles or practices, except for any such change
required by reason of a concurrent change in GAAP or (c) any declaration,

    SECTION 5.10.  Absence of Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement,
                   ---------------------
there is no litigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, or any material property of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, before
any court, arbitrator or Governmental Entity, which, if resolved adversely to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (a) could reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b) seeks to present the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or any material property or assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or
other similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent, continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Entity, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any court, arbitrator or
Governmental Entity. Parent does not have knowledge of any reasonable basis for
any claim, complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary which would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION 5.11.  Taxes.  Parent is not aware of any agreement, plan or other
                   -----
circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying under Section 368(a)
of the Code.

    SECTION 5.12.  Brokers. Except for Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation,
                   -------
no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
other fee or commission in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or the Merger Sub.

    SECTION 5.13.  Financing.  Parent has all funds necessary to consummate the
                   ---------
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    SECTION 5.14.  Accounting Matters.  To its knowledge, based on consultation
                   ------------------
with its independent accountants, neither Parent nor any of its directors,
officers or affiliates has taken any action, nor is there any fact pertaining to
Parent or any of its affiliates, which would interfere with (i) Parent's ability
to account for the Merger as a pooling of interests or (ii) Parent's or the
Surviving Corporation's ability to continue to account for as a pooling of
interests any past acquisition by Parent currently accounted for as a pooling of
interests.

    SECTION 7.01.  California Permit; Company Shareholder Approval.  (a)  As
                   -----------------------------------------------
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 20 business days) after the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare the necessary documents and
Parent shall apply to obtain a permit (a "California Permit") from the
                                          -----------------
California Commissioner of Corporations (after a hearing before such Department)
pursuant to Section 25121 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968 and
a related information statement or other disclosure document (the "Information
                                                                   -----------
Statement"), so that the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall
---------
be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by virtue of the exemption
from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) thereof.  The Company shall
cooperate with, and provide information to, Parent in connection with Parent's
application for the California Permit.  The Company and Parent will respond to
any comments from the California Commissioner of Corporations and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to have the California Permit granted as soon as
practicable after such filing; provided, however, that the Parent shall not be
                               --------  -------
required to modify in any material way any of the terms and conditions of the
Agreement.  None of the information supplied by the Company to Parent in
connection with the California Permit application or any other document prepared
to comply with federal or state securities laws shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

                                       32
<PAGE>

necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         (b)  The Company and the Shareholders shall take all action necessary
for the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement within five
business days of the date of the issuance of the California Permit. By way of
amplification and not limitation, the Company, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall, in accordance with all applicable legal requirements and its
articles of incorporation and by-laws, (i) promptly solicit an action by written
consent in lieu of a meeting of Shareholders of the Company (or if, required by
law, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of Shareholders of
the Company), (ii) unanimously recommend the approval of the Merger and adoption
of this Agreement, (iii) take all lawful action to solicit such approval and
(iv) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent
of Shareholders required by California Law.

    SECTION 7.02.  Covenants of the Shareholders. (a) Each Shareholder, solely
                   -----------------------------
in such Shareholder's capacity as a Shareholder of the Company, agrees to vote
(or cause to be voted) all shares of Company Common Stock currently beneficially
owned by such Shareholder, and all shares of Company Common Stock which such
Shareholder acquires in the future, at any meeting of the Shareholders of the
Company, and in any action by written consent of the Shareholders of the
Company, in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

         (b)  (i)   For purposes of Section 7.02(b)(iii) below, each Shareholder
hereby constitutes and appoints Parent, which shall act by and through Robert G.
Deuster and/or Charles F. Cargile (each, a "Proxy Holder"), individually or
                                            ------------
jointly, with full power of substitution, its true and lawful proxy and
attorney-in-fact to vote at any meeting (and any adjournment or postponement
thereof) of the Company's shareholders called for purposes of considering
whether to approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions or matters contemplated by, or directly or indirectly affecting,
the Merger Agreement or to execute a written consent of shareholders in lieu of
any such meeting, all Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such
Shareholder as of the date of such meeting or written consent in favor of the
approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, with such modifications to the Merger
Agreements as the parties thereto may make.

              (ii)  This proxy and power of attorney (A) is granted in
    consideration of Parent's agreement in the Merger Agreement to consummate
    the Merger and to issue shares of Parent Common Stock, each on the terms set
    forth in the Merger Agreement, (B) is intended to secure the Company's
    obligations under the Merger Agreement and therefore shall be irrevocable
    during the term of this Agreement and (C) is coupled with an interest
    sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy. This proxy revokes all
    prior proxies granted by such Shareholder. Such Shareholder shall not grant
    any proxy to any person that conflicts with the proxy granted herein, and
    any attempt to do so shall be void. The power of attorney granted herein is
    a durable power of attorney and shall survive the death or incapacity of
    such Shareholder.

              (iii) If a Shareholder fails for any reason to vote his shares of
    Company Common Stock in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a)
    above, then the Proxy Holder shall have the right to vote such Shareholder's
    shares of Company Common Stock at any meeting of the Company's shareholders
    and in any action by written consent of the

                                       33
<PAGE>

    Company's shareholders in accordance with the provisions of this Section
    7.02(b). The vote of the Proxy Holder shall control in any conflict between
    his vote of such Company Common Stock and a vote by a Shareholder of such
    Company Common Stock.

              (iv)  Each Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent
    and the Merger Sub are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon
    such Shareholder's execution and delivery of this Agreement and performance
    of such Shareholder's obligations hereunder.

    SECTION 7.03.  Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except as

required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or
arrangement to which the Company is a party or pursuant to applicable Law, from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall: (i) provide

legal counsel, agents and other representatives, collectively,
"Representatives") reasonable access at reasonable times upon prior notice to
 ---------------
the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and to the books and records thereof and (ii) furnish promptly such
information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities,
personnel and other aspects of the Company as Parent or its Representatives may
reasonably request.

         (b)  Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its Representatives to
comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement dated October 3, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") between the
                                      -------------------------
Company and Parent.

         (c)  The Company will hold, and will cause its Representatives to hold,
in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of
Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if such
provisions were applicable to the Company.

    SECTION 7.04.  Employee Benefits Matters.  (a)  From and after the Effective
                   -------------------------
Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in
accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements and
commitments of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to the extent disclosed in writing to Parent prior to the Effective Time, that
are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company.

         (b)  Parent hereby agrees that, immediately following the Effective
Time, it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide employee
benefit and compensation plans, programs, contracts and arrangements for the
benefit of employees of the Company which, in the aggregate, will provide
benefits and compensation that are at least equivalent to, and no less favorable
than, the benefits and compensation provided to such employees under the
employee benefit and compensation plans, programs, contracts and arrangements of
similarly situated employees of Parent; provided, however, that changes may be
                                        --------  -------
made to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law.

         (c)  To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility and vesting
(and, solely for purposes of calculating entitlement to vacation and sick days,
benefit accruals) under any retirement plan, employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries for the benefit of employees of Parent, such plan, program or
arrangement shall credit Company employees for service accrued or deemed accrued
on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any affiliate or
predecessor thereof. In addition, Parent shall waive

                                       34

limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable Plan and recognize, for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Company's
employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

         (d)  On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best
efforts to enter into employment agreements in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B with each of Messrs. Bacchi, Filipski and Harris.

of the Company to continue their employment with the Surviving Corporation.

providing copies of all such documents to the nonfiling party and its advisors
prior to filing and, if requested, by accepting all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith.  If at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall
take all such necessary action.

         (b)  Parent and the Company shall file promptly after the date of this
Agreement notifications under the HSR Act or any other filing required by

inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the

<PAGE>

         (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or competition Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other person so as to
enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, including, without limitation, committing to and/or
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale or
disposition of such of the shares of Company Common Stock, or its or the
Company's or their subsidiaries' assets, as are required to be divested or
entering into such other arrangements as are required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of any part or all
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that
                                                    --------  -------
Parent shall not be required to make any divestiture of any assets that are
material to the Company or to the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto, shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action
or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could

Corporation, Parent nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action,
cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to
fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail
to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

         (b)  As of the date hereof, the Company and the Shareholders do not
know of any reason (i) why they would not be able to deliver to Shearman &
Sterling, with a copy to Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth, at the date of the
legal opinions referred to below, a certificate substantially in compliance with
IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable Shearman & Sterling to deliver the legal
opinion contemplated by Section 8.03(c), and the Company and the Shareholders
hereby agree to deliver such certificate effective as of the date of such
opinion or (ii) why Shearman & Sterling would not be able to deliver the opinion
required by Section 8.03(c).

         (c)  As of the date hereof, Parent does not know of any reason (i) why
it would not be able to deliver to Shearman & Sterling, with a copy to Stradling

certificate substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable
Shearman & Sterling to deliver the legal opinion contemplated by Section
8.03(c), and Parent hereby agrees to deliver such certificate effective as of
the date of such opinion or (ii) why Shearman & Sterling would not be able to
deliver the opinion required by Section 8.03(c).

    SECTION 7.07.  Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to

in accordance with

                                       38

Agreement as a pooling of interests, if such qualification becomes jeopardized

                   ---------------

------------------
he shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) engage, directly
or indirectly, in the Company Business, or (ii) directly or indirectly, own an
interest in, manage, operate, join, control, lend money or render financial or
other assistance to or participate in, or be connected with, as an officer,
employee, partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any person that engages

Section 7.17, ownership of securities having no more than three (3%) percent of
the outstanding voting power of any entity that is listed on any national
securities exchange or traded actively in the national over-the-counter market
shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Section 7.17 so long as the
person owning such securities has no other connection or relationship with such
entity.

         (b)  As a separate and independent covenant, the Shareholders agree
with Parent that, during the Restricted Period, the Shareholders will not in any
way, directly or indirectly, attempt to interfere with any officers, employees,
representatives or agents of the Company, or induce or attempt to induce any of
them to leave the employ of the Company or violate the terms of their contracts,
or any employment arrangements or confidentiality agreements, with the Company.

         (c)  The Restricted Period shall be extended by the length of any
period during which any of the Shareholders is in breach of the terms of this
Section 7.17.

                                       39
<PAGE>

         (d)  The Shareholders acknowledge that the covenants of the
Shareholders set forth in this Section 7.17 are an essential element of this
Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Shareholders to comply with
these covenants, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.

    SECTION 7.18.  No Solicitation of Transactions. The Company will not,
                   -------------------------------
directly or indirectly, and will instruct its officers, directors, employees,
agents or advisors or other representatives (including, without limitation, any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it), not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action knowingly to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including,
without limitation, any proposal or offer to the Shareholders) that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction, or enter
into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person or entity
in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing Transaction, or
authorize or permit any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company,
or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by the Company, to take any such action. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact
with any person with respect thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is made.
The Company immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to a Competing Transaction.

                    --------------------------
9.04, a party against which indemnification may be sought is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party" and the party which may be entitled to indemnification is
-------------------
referred to as the "Indemnified Party".  The obligations and Liabilities of
                    -----------------
Indemnifying Parties under this Article IX with respect to Losses arising from
claims of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for
in this Article IX ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent
                     ------------------
upon the following additional terms and conditions:  if an Indemnified Party
shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Parties notice of such Third Party Claim within 90 days of the
receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the
                                                 --------  -------
failure to provide such notice shall not release an Indemnifying Party from any
of its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that such
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.  The notice of
claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified
Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith
estimate of the amount arising therefrom.

          (i)  If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation
     to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may
     result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
     entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
     expense and through counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the
     Indemnified Party, if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
     Indemnified Party within ten days of the receipt of such notice from the
     Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if (A) the Indemnifying Party
                        --------  -------
     fails to diligently defend such Third Party Claim and (B) there exists or
     is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
     inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party, in its reasonable
     discretion, for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party
     and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law

nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal

respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than a California state or
federal court.

                      --------------------
this Agreement are unique. Accordingly, each of the parties acknowledges and

     SECTION 11.11.   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
                      ----------------

hereto unless made in writing and signed by all parties hereto.
