All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding contemplated by _Section 2.10(e)_.

Each Company Warrant shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and no holder of any such Company Warrant shall have any rights thereafter with respect thereto except as expressly provided in this _Section 2.7(c)_. Any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 2.7(c)_ shall be paid upon surrender of the warrant certificate (a "Warrant Certificate") representing such Company Warrant in the manner provided in _Section 2.10_ (less amounts to be placed into the Escrow Account and the Stockholder Representative Fund as set forth in _Section 2.9(d)_ hereof).

Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn   ##### 

  

  

  

or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Capital Stock

receive the consideration payable in respect of such shares in accordance
with _Section 2.6(a)_, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in _Section 2.10_. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law.

transfer of immediately available funds.

The portion of the Stockholder Representative Fund contributed by each Company Indemnifying Party shall be an amount equal to (x) such Company Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion multiplied by (y) the Stockholder Representative Fund. Without any act of any Company Indemnifying Party, each Company Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have received the full consideration payable in respect of its securities in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_,  _Section 2.7(a)_ and _Section 2.7(c)_ and to have deposited with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to (x) such Company Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion multiplied by (y) the Escrow Amount, as security for the indemnity provided for in _Article VIII_ and as security for any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)(iii)_. 

   

 2.10 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Payment Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock to receive the funds to which holders of shares of Company Capital Stock shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_.

Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the later of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the date the Payment Agent receives the Spreadsheet and confirms that it has received all other information it reasonably requested in order to make the payments pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and  _Section 2.7(c)_), Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect of such shares in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ (together with the Warrant Certificates, the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect of such securities in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ and  _Section 2.7(c)_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by   #####

Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
consideration payable in respect of such securities in accordance with
_Section 2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.7(c)_, and the Certificates so surrendered

 (c) _Payments with respect to Unsurrendered Shares; No Liability_. At any time following the 180th day after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Payment Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Payment Agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Payment Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Payment Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share of Company Capital Stock or of a Company Warrant for any consideration delivered in respect of such share of Company Capital Stock or such Company Warrant to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 

   

 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If the payment of the consideration payable in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ or Company Warrants in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_ is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificates so surrendered be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer (including without limitation, if requested by Parent or the Payment Agent, a medallion guarantee), and that the persons requesting such payment will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 (f) _Adjustments_. If during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Capital Stock, shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of Company Capital Stock, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the consideration payable in respect of such shares in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change. 

   

 (g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.

 2.11 _Adjustments to the Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) _Working Capital and Long-Term Debt Balance Adjustments_. 

   

 (i) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company attaching a reasonable and good faith estimate of the Working Capital as of fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing (but including an estimation of Third Party Expenses as of the Closing) (the "Estimated Working Capital") and the Long-Term Debt Balance as of the Closing (the "Closing Long-Term Debt Balance," and which estimate shall be the "Estimated Long-Term Debt Balance"). The Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Long-Term Debt Balance shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement, including _Schedule 2.11_ and _Section 2.11(c)_ , and, in the case of Estimated Working Capital, shall be in the same form as the Form Working Capital Statement. Upon delivery of the Estimated Working Capital and the Estimated Long-Term Debt Balance to Parent, the Company shall provide Parent and its representatives with reasonable access to the Employees, agreements and books and records of the Company to verify the accuracy of such amounts. The Merger Consideration payable at the Closing shall either be (i) increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated 

   ##### 

  

    

Working Capital is greater than the Working Capital Target or (ii) reduced on
a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Working
Capital Threshold Amount, (x) the Merger Consideration shall not be adjusted
at Closing pursuant to this  _Section 2.11(a)(i)_, (y) the Working Capital
Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section
2.9(b)(i)_ and (z) any adjustments to the Merger Consideration based on the
Closing Working Capital shall only be made after the Closing Date pursuant to
_Section 2.11(b)(i)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount by which
the Estimated Working Capital is greater or less than the Working Capital
Target is less than $100,000, then for purposes of this section, no
adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration. In addition, the Merger
Consideration payable at the Closing shall either be (i) decreased on a
dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Long-
Term Debt Balance is greater than the Long-Term Debt Balance Target or (ii)
increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Long-Term Debt Balance is less than the Long-Term Debt Balance
Target. 

  

 (ii) Parent shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered to the Stockholder Representative, a calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Closing Working Capital") and the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance (the "Closing Statement") together with such schedules and data with respect to the determination thereof as may be appropriate to support such Closing Statement. The Closing Working Capital and the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement, including _Schedule 2.11_ and _Section 2.11(c)_ , and, in the case of Closing Working Capital, shall be in the same form as the Form Working Capital Statement. If Parent does not deliver the Closing Statement to the Stockholder Representative within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, then the Stockholder Representative, with the reasonable assistance of those employees of the Surviving Corporation performing the functions of Chief Financial Officer or the Vice President of Finance and those individuals who, directly or indirectly, report to the Chief Financial Officer or the Vice President of Finance along with any other advisers the Stockholder Representative may reasonably engage (collectively, the "Finance Employees"), may prepare and present the Closing Statement within an additional ninety (90) days. If the Stockholder Representative prepares the Closing Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then, with respect to such statement or notice, all references in this _Section 2.11(a)_ to the Stockholder Representative and Parent, respectively, shall be read as references to Parent and the Stockholder Representative, respectively. Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall provide the Stockholder Representative and the Finance Employees who are assisting the Stockholder Representative in the preparation of the Closing Statement, if applicable, with full and complete access to the records of the Surviving Corporation, solely for the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement in accordance with this Agreement, all to the extent deemed reasonably necessary by the Stockholder Representative and in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the Surviving Corporations business. Parent agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance become final and binding on the parties hereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, it will not take, and will not permit the Surviving Corporation to take, any actions with respect to any accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance are to be based or derived from that would materially impede or delay, or otherwise make unavailable information required for, the determination of the Closing 

   ##### 

  

    

Working Capital or the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance in the manner and
utilizing the methods required by this Agreement. The Closing Working Capital
shall reflect as a prepaid expense or accrued, reserved or actual liability
an amount equal to the full amount of the unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes of the
Company as of the Closing Date, whether or not then due or payable. 

  

 (iii) If the Stockholder Representative disagrees in whole or in part with the Closing Statement, then within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing Statement, it shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing (the "Notice of Disagreement"), setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of any such disagreement; _provided, however,_ that any such objection shall be limited to any failure on the part of Parent to prepare the Closing Statement in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 2.11(a)_ and to mathematical or similar errors. To be effective, any such Notice of Disagreement shall include a copy of the Closing Statement marked to indicate those specific line items that are in dispute (the "Disputed Line Items") and shall be accompanied by the Stockholder Representatives calculation of each of the Disputed Line Items and the Stockholder Representatives revised Closing Statement setting forth its determination of the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance, as the case may be. To the extent the Stockholder Representative provides a Notice of Disagreement within such 30-day period, all items that are not Disputed Line Items shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder unless the resolution of such Disputed Line Item affects an undisputed item, in which case such undisputed item shall remain open and be considered a Disputed Line Item by Parent. In the event that the Stockholder Representative does not provide a Notice of Disagreement within such 30-day period, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted in full the Closing Statement as prepared by Parent, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any Notice of Disagreement is timely provided and contains the proper information as aforesaid, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any Disputed Line Items. During such 15-day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall have access to the working papers, schedules and calculations of the other used in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement and the determination of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance and Disputed Line Items. If, at the end of such period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve such Disputed Line Items, then such Disputed Line Items shall be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers declines to serve, such other firm selected by the mutual agreement of Parent and Stockholder Representative (the "Settlement Accountants"). Parent and the Stockholder Representative will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be rendered by the Settlement Accountants under this _Section 2.11(a)(iii)_. The Settlement Accountants shall be directed to determine as promptly as practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) days from the date that the dispute is submitted to it), whether the Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 2.11(a)_ and whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Working Capital or the Closing Long-Term Debt Balance requires adjustment, limiting its review, however, only to the Disputed Line Items so submitted. The Settlement Accountants shall resolve each Disputed Line Item by calculating such Disputed Line Item in accordance with this Agreement and establishing as the final amount of such Disputed Line Item the applicable amount so calculated. The Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Representative shall each furnish to the Settlement Accountants such work 

   ##### 

  

    

papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues,
and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as such Settlement
Accountants may reasonably request. The determination of the Settlement
Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The
amounts determined to be the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Long-
Term Debt Balance pursuant to  _Section 2.11(a)(ii)_ and _Section
2.11(a)(iii)_ shall constitute the "Final Working Capital" and the "Final
Long-Term Debt Balance." 

  

 (iv) The fees and expenses of the Settlement Accountants shall be allocated between Parent and the Company Indemnifying Parties in such manner that the Company Indemnifying Parties shall be responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses equal to such fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value of Disputed Line Items submitted to the Settlement Accountants that are resolved in a manner further from the position submitted to the Settlement Accountants by the Stockholder Representative and closer to the position submitted to the Settlement Accountants by Parent (as finally determined by the Settlement Accountants), and the denominator of which is the total dollar value of the Disputed Line Items so submitted, and Parent shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and expenses and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to pay such fees on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties from the Stockholder Representative Fund. 

  

 (b) _Post Closing Adjustment Amounts_. 

   

 (i) After determination of the Final Working Capital and the Final Long-Term Debt Balance, the Merger Consideration shall be, if necessary, further adjusted such that Parent and the Company Stockholders receive or make payments to each other so that, after taking into account any prior payments under _Section 2.11(a)(i)_, each receives or makes payments in an amount exactly equal to the amount that would have been made under _Section 2.11(a)(i)_ if the Estimated Working Capital had equaled the Final Working Capital and the Estimated Long-Term Debt Balance had equaled the Final Long-Term Debt Balance. All payments to be made under this _Section 2.11(b)(i)_ may be made on a net basis taking into account payments received under _Section 2.11(a)(i)_. 

  

 (ii) If a net payment is required to be made by Parent under _Section 2.11(b)(i)_, then Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deliver, (A) if applicable (x) written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver the amount of such net payment out of the Working Capital Escrow Account to the Payment Agent, and (y) if the Working Capital Escrow Amount is insufficient to make such net payment, an amount equal to the difference between the Working Capital Escrow Amount and such net payment, or (B) if the Working Capital Escrow Account was not established, an amount equal to such net payment, each of (A) and (B) together with interest on such net payment from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Prime Rate. Each such amount shall be delivered by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Payment Agent, or to another account designated in written instructions by the Stockholder Representative, for the benefit of the Company Indemnifying Parties. 

  

 (iii) If a net payment is required to be made to Parent under _Section 2.11(b)(i)_, then the Stockholder Representative shall provide written instruction to the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

    

Agent to deliver from the Escrow Account to Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, an
amount equal to such net payment, together with interest on such net payment
from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Prime Rate. 

  

 (iv) If there remains a balance in the Working Capital Escrow Account after giving effect to the foregoing payments, then the Stockholder Representative shall provide written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver such balance to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. 

  

 (v) Payments pursuant to this _Section 2.11(b)_ shall be deemed adjustments to the Merger Consideration. Upon any payment pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)(ii)_, each of the Company Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to (x) such Company Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion multiplied by (y) such payment. For purposes of this  _Section 2.11(b)_, all computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed in the period for which such interest is payable. Any payments made pursuant to this  _Section 2.11(b)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the Final Working Capital and the Final Long-Term Debt Balance are final and binding on the parties hereto. 

  

 (c) _Calculations_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction), more than once in the calculation of (including any component of) the Estimated Working Capital, the Estimated Long-Term Debt Balance, the Final Working Capital, the Final Long-Term Debt Balance or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be over- or under-counted for purposes of such calculation. The parties hereto further covenant and agree that if any provision of this Agreement requires an amount or calculation to be "determined in accordance with this Agreement and GAAP" (or words of similar import), then to the extent that the terms of this Agreement (including _Schedule 2.11_) expressly conflict with, or are expressly inconsistent with, GAAP in connection with such determination, the terms of this Agreement (including _Schedule 2.11_) shall control. 

   

 2.12 _Escrow Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall enter into an Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent substantially in the form of  _Exhibit C_, subject to any administrative changes as may be required by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"). 

  

 2.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action.

modifying its recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger (any of the foregoing actions, whether
by the Board or a committee thereof, a "Change of Recommendation") at any
time prior to the Stockholder Approval if the Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that in light of such
Acquisition Proposal, such Change of Recommendation is required in order for
the Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable law _provided_ , that the Company shall give Parent
prior written notice twenty-four (24) hours prior to making any Change of
Recommendation.

("Virginia Employees"), in lieu of the foregoing Parent may permit such
Continuing Employees to participate in medical, dental, vision, accidental

coverage which is substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the
corresponding plans maintained by the Company as of the date hereof for
Virginia Employees ("Substitute Virginia Plans"). 

   

 (b) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide service credit for all periods of service by the Continuing Employees (other than Virginia Employees to the extent covered by Substitute Virginia Plans) under the employee policies and plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, except (i) for purposes of matching contributions under Parents plan intended to include a IRC Section 401(k) arrangement, and (ii) to the extent such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by applicable law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time policies of directors and officers liability insurance no less favorable in all material respects to that maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement (and having coverage and containing terms and conditions, which, in the aggregate, are not less advantageous to the persons currently covered by such policies as insureds) with respect to claims arising from any actual or alleged wrongful act or omission occurring prior to the Effective Time for which a claim has not been made against any director or officer of the Company or any director or officer of a Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. The costs of such directors and officers liability insurance shall be borne by Parent to the extent the cost of such insurance is no more than $80,000; _provided_ , that all such costs in excess of $80,000 shall be borne by the Company and shall be reflected in the Closing Working Capital. 

   ##### 

  

    

This _Section 6.13_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
Company Indemnified Party, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the
Company Indemnified Parties. 

  

 6.14 _Termination of Certain Benefit Plans_. Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a IRC Section 401(k) arrangement unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such plans shall not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. 

  

 6.15 _S-8 Registration_. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, if necessary, Parent agrees to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-8, if available for use by Parent, registering that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to  _Section 2.7(b)_ that are eligible to registered on Form S-8. 

  

 6.16 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Tax Returns_. The Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for preparing all Tax Returns for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that are to be filed after the Closing Date and include a period, or part of a period that began before the Closing Date (each, including any amendment thereof, a "Final Return"). All Final Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior Tax Returns, unless otherwise required by law, and shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative no later than thirty (30) days before the due date for the filing of the Final Return (taking into account properly acquired extensions of time to file) for its reasonable review and approval. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate fully with Stockholder Representative and its representatives, on its review of the Final Return. The Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have approved to the Final Return unless it delivers a written notice of disagreement to Parent within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Final Return (the "Disagreement Notice").

policies with respect to which premiums were paid by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, or (B) indemnities from third parties; and _provided_ ,

 (c) For the purpose of this _Article VIII_ only, when determining the amount of Losses attributable to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the company (but not for determining whether any such representation or warranty has been breached), any representation or warranty given or made by the Company that is qualified in scope as to materiality (including Material Adverse Effect) shall be deemed to be made or given without such qualification. 

   

 8.3 _Escrow Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) _Escrow Account_. The Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by 

   ##### 

  

    

them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this _Article VIII_
and to satisfy any obligation with respect to the calculation of Final
Working Capital and Final Long-Term Debt Balance under _Section 2.11_. 

  

 (b) _Basket_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnified Parties may not recover any Losses unless and until one or more Officers Certificates identifying Losses, which are determined pursuant to this Article VIII to be indemnifiable and reimbursable pursuant to this _Article VIII_ in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate (the "Basket Amount") has or have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative as provided in _Section 8.3(f)_, in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all Losses so determined.

Claims by an Indemnified Party for Losses shall be satisfied: (A) first, from the Escrow Account and (B) second, with respect to Special Losses only, against the Company Indemnifying Parties directly, subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3(f)_ and _Section 8.4_. 

   

 (d) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. 

   

 (i) On the first day of the thirteenth (13th) month after the Closing Date (the "First Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Indemnifying Parties an amount equal to (x) $21,250,000 _minus_ (y) any amounts which have been used to satisfy claims specified in any Officers Certificate prior to the First Release Date, or which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, are necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the First Release Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the First Release Date. All dividends, income, interest, gains and other distributions earned with respect to the Escrow Amount which has accrued through the date of the First Release Date shall be released on the First Release Date and Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Indemnifying Parties such amount. 

  

 (ii) On the first day of the nineteenth (19th) month after the Closing Date (the "Final Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Indemnifying Parties an amount equal to (i) the then remaining balance in the Escrow Account _minus_ (ii) any amounts which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, are necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the Final Release Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Final Release Date. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Indemnifying Parties the remaining portion of the Escrow Account, if any, not required to satisfy such claims. All dividends, income, interest, gains and other distributions earned with respect to the Escrow Amount which has accrued from the First Release Date 

   ##### 

  

    

through the Final Release Date shall be released on the Final Release Date

amount. 

  

 (iii) Upon any payments of the Escrow Amount out of the Escrow Account to the Company Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_, each of the Company Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to (x) such Company Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion multiplied by (y) such payment. 

  

 (e) _Protection of Escrow Account_. The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Account during the period the Escrow Account is in effect, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Account only in accordance with the terms of this _Article VIII_. The Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Amount in a liquid U.S. bank money market account. All income earned on the Escrow Amount shall be added to and deemed a part of the Escrow Account. For tax reporting and withholding purposes, all such income shall be treated, and shall be reported by the Escrow Agent, as income of the Company Indemnifying Parties, in an amount for each Company Indemnifying Party equal to (x) such Company Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion multiplied by (y) such interest amount. 

   

 (f) _Claims for Indemnification_. 

   

 (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the Final Release Date of an Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3(g)_ and _Section 2.11_, deliver to Parent, as promptly as practicable, cash in the Escrow Account equal to such Losses. 

  

 (ii) If Losses incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties with respect to Special Losses exceed the value of the cash in the Escrow Account, then an Indemnified Party may make a claim directly against the Company Indemnifying Parties for their Pro Rata Portion multiplied by such excess amount not recovered from the Escrow Account; _provided, however_ , that except as set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ hereof, in no event shall a Company Indemnifying Partys aggregate indemnification obligations with respect to Losses incurred or sustained by any and all Indemnified Parties exceed the Merger Consideration actually received by such Company Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (iii) Subject to the first sentence of _Section 8.5(a)_, if the Stockholder Representative does not object in writing within the 30-day period after delivery by the Parent of the Officers Certificate, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and Company Indemnifying Parties that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate. 

  

 (g) _Objections to Claims against the Escrow Account_. 

   

 (i) At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative, and for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall 

   ##### 

  

    

make no delivery to Parent of any Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)_
unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Stockholder Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of
such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of cash from
the Escrow Account equal to the amount of Losses claimed in the Officers
Certificate, provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if the
Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim
made in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty
(30) day period. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the calculation of the Final Working Capital and the Final Long-Term Debt Balance, in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.11(a)_, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement and the Company Indemnifying Parties, and none of the Parent or the Stockholder Representative shall have any further right to challenge such calculation thereof or seek indemnity under this _Article VIII_ with respect to any Losses arising therefrom. 

  

 (h) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_. 

   

 (i) In case the Stockholder Representative shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate to recover Losses from the Escrow Account, or from the Company Indemnifying Parties directly, within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Officers Certificate, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Account, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute cash from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior to sixty (60) days after delivery of an Officers Certificate, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If either party fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by the other party. 

  

 (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in San Francisco County, California, under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without limitation, the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the 

   ##### 

  

    

administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator or
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery
while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of
the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to
discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of
any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Company Indemnifying
Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within thirty (30) days of a
decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such
party shall make the payment to such other party. 

  

 (iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute between the Company Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_, whether relating to claims upon the Escrow Account or to the other indemnification obligations set forth in this  _Article VIII_. 

  

 (i) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Account or for other indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative of such claim, provided, that the failure to so notify the Stockholder Representative shall not relieve it of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim, which expense shall be reimbursable out of the Stockholder Representative Fund. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided, however_ , that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Company Indemnifying Parties shall not have any power or authority to object under any provision of this  _Article VIII_ to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Account with respect to such settlement. 

   

 8.4 _Maximum Payments; Remedy; Limitation of Liability_. 

  

 (a) Other than with respect to Special Losses, which shall be subject to _Section 8.3(f)(ii)_ , the maximum amount the Indemnified Parties may recover from the Company Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the indemnity set forth in _Section 8.2_ for Losses shall be   ##### 

  

  

  

limited to an amount equal to (x) such Company Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata
Portion multiplied by (y) the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing shall limit the liability of a Company Stockholder in respect of
Losses suffered by the Indemnified Parties arising out of any fraud
determined to have been committed by such Company Stockholder in connection
with this Agreement, in any Related Agreement or in any certificate or other
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the part of the Company. 

   

 (b) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement if the Merger does not close. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company Indemnifying Parties shall have no indemnification obligation under this Agreement if the Transaction does not close. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Company Indemnifying Party shall have any liability for Losses or Special Losses under this Article VIII to the extent (x) there is included in the Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve related to such Loss or (y) such Loss is reflected in the Final Working Capital. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss under this  _Article VIII_ notwithstanding the fact that such Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related thereto. 

   

 8.5 _Stockholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Company Indemnifying Parties hereby appoints John Backus as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to Parent from the Escrow Account in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholder Representative shall have no power or authority to bind any Company Indemnifying Parties with respect to Losses that are not satisfied from the Escrow Account. The appointment, rights, powers and obligations of the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement are exclusive, and no Company Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assert any such right or power granted to the Stockholder Representative hereunder. Such agency may be changed by the Company Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of not less than a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Account agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Account. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its   #####

The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative unless such act or omission is the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Indemnifying Parties on whose behalf the Escrow Amount and the Stockholder Representative Fund was contributed to the Escrow Account shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against such Company Indemnifying Parties Pro Rata Amount of any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to recover any such loss, liability or expense arising out of or in connection with the administration of his duties hereunder from the Stockholder Representative Fund and the Escrow Agent shall release the amount of such loss, liability or expense from the Stockholder Representative Fund promptly upon the written instruction of the Stockholder Representative. No Indemnified Party or any other party shall have any recourse whatsoever to the Stockholder Representative Fund. Upon termination of the Escrow Agreement the balance remaining in the Stockholder Representative Fund, if any, shall be distributed to the Company Indemnifying Parties by the Escrow Agent upon the written instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

   

 (c) The Stockholder Representative shall have reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation and Parent and the reasonable assistance of Surviving Corporations and Parents respective officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights and responsibilities hereunder. 

   

 (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 9.3_ and _9.4_ , shall constitute a decision of the Company Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.
