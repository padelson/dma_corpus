Representative will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be
rendered by the Settlement Accountants under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.11(a)(iii)</U>. The Settlement

thirty (30)&nbsp;days from the date that the dispute is submitted to it), whether the Closing Statement

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;In case the Stockholder Representative shall object in writing to any claim or claims made
in any Officer&#146;s Certificate to recover Losses from the Escrow Account, or from the Company
Indemnifying Parties directly, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after delivery of such Officer&#146;s
Certificate, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Account, shall
be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and distribute cash from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms thereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior to sixty (60)
days after delivery of an Officer&#146;s Certificate, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative
may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending
litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount
is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after submission of any dispute to
arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator,
then, within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the end of such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall
select a third arbitrator. If either party fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15)
day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator
selected by the other party.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;Any such arbitration shall be held in San Francisco County, California, under the rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all
expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without limitation, the respective
expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the

Arbitration Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited
time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while
allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing
parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall
have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys&#146; fees and costs, to the same extent as
a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the
arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Officer&#146;s Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement and the Company Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and
shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award,
judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of a decision of
the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to
such other party.

claims upon the Escrow Account or to the other indemnification obligations set forth in this

which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Account or for other
indemnification pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder
Representative of such claim, provided, that the failure to so notify the Stockholder
Representative shall not relieve it of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties, at its expense, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim, which expense shall be
reimbursable out of the Stockholder Representative Fund. Parent shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; <I>provided, however</I>, that except
with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such claim with
third-party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In
the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Company
Indemnifying Parties shall not have any power or authority to object under any provision of this
