 **1.7** ** _Certain Provisions Regarding Assignments_.**  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign the Assigned Contract referenced in
_Schedule 1.7_ if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a
third party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights
of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an
agreement concerning such Assigned Contract, or would in any way adversely
affect the rights of Seller or, upon transfer, Buyer under such Assigned
Contract. If any transfer or assignment by Seller to, or any assumption by
Buyer of, any interest in, or Liability under, the Assigned Contract
referenced in _Schedule 1.7_ requires the consent of a third party, then
such assignment or assumption shall be

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

made subject to such consent being obtained. If such consent is not obtained
prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate (at their own expense) to ensure that Buyer shall,
following the Closing, obtain the economic and other (i) benefits and (ii)
obligations under the Assigned Contract referenced on _Schedule 1.7_ with
respect to which the consent has not been obtained.  The parties acknowledge
that this _Section 1.7_ does not in any way modify the provisions of
_Sections 6.5_, _6.14_ , and _7.2(f)_.

proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Seller and, assuming due execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent such enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally or general equitable
principles.

Seller does not, and performance of this Agreement by Seller shall not: (i)

judgment, order, or decree (" **Judgment** ") applicable to Seller or by which

material breach of or constitute a material default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a material default) under, or
materially impair Sellers rights or materially alter the rights or
obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, material amendment, material acceleration or cancellation of,
any Contract to which Seller is a party or by which any of its properties or
assets is bound and which relates to the Business or the Assets, or (iii)
result in the creation of a Lien on any of the Assets.

valid title to, and is the lawful owner of, all of the Assets, free and clear

28

transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

 **6.6** ** _Employee Matters_.**

  



  

(a) Effective as of the end of business on the Closing Date (the "
**Employment Termination Date** "), Seller shall terminate, and effective as
of the beginning of business on the business day following the Closing Date
(the " **Employment Commencement Date** "), Buyer will offer to employ the
employees of Seller listed on _Section 3.15(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and who are employed by Seller as of the Closing Date. Such offer of
employment shall include compensation (including bonuses, commissions, stock
options, restricted stock, other forms of equity compensation and benefits)
that is comparable to the compensation (including bonuses, commissions, stock
options, restricted stock, other forms of equity compensation and benefits)
provided to such employees by Seller immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement. Those employees described in the preceding sentence who
accept employment with (and become employed by) Buyer are the " **Transferred
Employees**."  On and after the Closing, Buyer shall provide to the
Transferred Employees participation in any pension, 401(k), medical, dental,
vision, life, disability and other benefit plans (the " **Buyer Plans**
") offered to similarly situated employees of Buyer. To the extent permitted
under the Buyer Plans, Buyer shall take all necessary actions to provide that
Transferred Employees will receive full credit for years of service with
Seller under the Buyer Plans to the extent taken into account for such
purposes under the benefit plans of Seller in which such Persons were
participating as of the date of this Agreement (the " **Seller Plans** ")
prior to the Closing (other than with respect to benefit accrual under
employee 401(k) or other pension or retiree welfare benefit plans and not for
equity compensation vesting or vacation). To the extent permitted under the
Buyer Plans, Buyer shall give credit under those of its Buyer Plans that are
welfare benefit plans for all amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-
pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by
Transferred Employees (including their eligible dependents), in respect of
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. For any Transferred Employee or
dependent of a Transferred Employee who has satisfied Sellers pre-existing
condition exclusion and/or who has creditable coverage from another group
plan or individual plan, such Transferred Employee or such dependent would
not be subject to Buyers pre-existing condition exclusion. If a Transferred
Employee or dependent of a Transferred Employee has partially satisfied
Sellers pre-existing condition exclusion, the amount of time credited to the
completion of that pre-existing condition exclusion will be honored by Buyer.

  



  

29   

     
   

  



  

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for making continuation coverage under Code
Section 4980B and Sections 601-608 of ERISA (" **COBRA** ") available to any
Transferred Employee and any eligible spouse or dependent who experiences a
"qualifying event," as defined in Code Section 4980B(f)(3), after the
Employment Termination Date.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any possible inferences to the contrary, Buyer and Seller
do not intend for this _Section 6.6_ to create any rights or obligations
except as among Buyer and Seller and no past, present or future employees of
Seller or Buyer (or dependents thereof) shall be treated as third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

 **6.7** ** _Insurance Matters_.** Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to keep all insurance policies presently maintained
relating to the Business in full force and effect through the close of
business on the Closing Date.  Coverage of the Assets shall terminate as of
the Closing Date under all such policies.

  



  

 **6.8** ** _Noncompetition Agreement_.** As an inducement for Buyer to enter
into this Agreement, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date,
Seller will not, directly or indirectly, engage in, acquire, own or hold a
business anywhere in the world that competes with the Business as conducted
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " **Seller Restricted Business**
"), including as a proprietor, principal, agent, partner, stockholder, member
of any association, consultant or otherwise.  The restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.8_ shall not prohibit or otherwise restrict Seller from (i)
purchasing and/or owning (directly or indirectly) up to two percent of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of a publicly held entity carrying on a
Seller Restricted Business, so long as Seller does not participate in the
control or take an active part in the management or direction thereof and
does not in any way render services thereto, (ii) acquiring (directly or
indirectly) any Person or business engaged in a Seller Restricted Business as
of the date of such acquisition (or as of any other date) (such Person or
business, an " **Acquired Business** "), if less than thirty percent (30%)
of the consolidated gross revenues of such Acquired Business during the
last completed fiscal year of such Acquired Business prior to such
acquisition were derived from any Seller Restricted Business, and Seller may
in such case continue to conduct such Seller Restricted Business through such
Acquired Business without any limitation or restriction hereunder; or (iii)
acquiring (directly or indirectly) any Acquired Business even if thirty
percent (30%) or more of the consolidated gross revenues of such Acquired
Business during the last completed fiscal year of such Acquired Business
prior to such acquisition were derived from any Seller Restricted Business,
provided that, in such event, Seller shall, no later than six (6) months
following the completion of such acquisition, dispose of the portion of such
Acquired Business that is then engaged in such Seller Restricted Business.

  



  

 **6.9** ** _Additional Services_.** Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer agree to negotiate in good faith a
customary business arrangement (including pricing) under which Seller would
purchase from Buyer the application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for
the products identified in Exhibit B of the Transition Services Agreement and
Buyer would provide the required support services for each of those products.
The parties shall attempt to reach an agreement on pricing and other terms
and conditions on a product by product basis. To the extent that the parties
are able to reach an agreement with respect to the ASIC for a specific
product, Buyer shall not be required to provide Seller Transition Services
(as

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

defined in the Transition Services Agreement) under the Transition Services
Agreement with respect to that product.

  



  

 **6.10** ** _Restrictions on Resale of Buyer Common Stock_.** The Buyer
Common Stock delivered by Buyer hereunder will be transferable by Seller only
pursuant to (a) public offerings registered under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities law or (b) an available exemption under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities law. The transfer agent
for the Buyer Common Stock has been instructed to block any transfers of
Buyer Common Stock that are not in compliance with these provisions. The
certificate representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock delivered hereunder
shall be imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:

  



  

"THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY
STATE SECURITIES ACT, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO
THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF SUCH ACTS OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM."

  



  

It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above shall be removed
by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if Seller shall
have delivered to Buyer an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the
Securities Act.

  



  

 **6.11** ** _Net Inventory Adjustment_.**

  



  

(a) On the day preceding the Closing Date, Seller shall conduct a physical
count of the Inventory on hand after the close of business on such day. The
parties will mutually agree in advance on a plan for the physical count of
the Inventory (including a determination of the scope thereof), and Buyer or
representatives of Buyer shall be entitled to observe the physical count of
the Inventory pursuant to such plan.

  



  

(b) Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (the " **Statement** ") setting forth the value
of the net Inventory as of the Closing (but determined immediately prior to
giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " **Closing Net
Inventory Value** "). If the Statement as prepared by Seller reflects a
Closing Net Inventory Value of less than $5,300,000, Seller shall include
with the Statement a check payable to Buyer in the amount of the difference
between $5,300,000 and the Closing Net Inventory Value. For purposes of
determining the Closing Net Inventory Value, the Inventory shall be valued in
accordance with the methodology used by Seller in the preparation of the
Financial Statements, including netting any reserve for excess or obsolete
inventory against the gross inventory balance.

  



  

(c) During the fifteen (15) day period following Buyers receipt of the
Statement, Buyer shall be permitted to review Sellers working papers
relating to the Statement. Unless Buyer gives written notice of its
disagreement with the Statement (a " **Notice of Disagreement** ") to Seller
prior to the twentieth (20th) day following delivery

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

of the Statement, then (A) the Statement shall become final and binding upon
such 20th day, and (B) if the Closing Net Inventory Value is more than
$5,300,000, Buyer within five (5) business days thereafter will deliver to
Seller a check payable to Seller in the amount by which the Closing Net
Inventory Value exceeds $5,300,000.

  



  

(d) Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by
Seller in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with
this _Section 6.11_) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Buyer on
the earlier of (i) the date on which Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement or (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm (as defined below).

  



  

(e) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek to resolve in writing any
differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer
shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the " **Accounting Firm** ")
for arbitration of any matters which remain in dispute and which were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be
the Orange County office of Ernst and Young, LLP or, if such firm is unable
or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer in
writing. Seller and Buyer hereby agree to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the
matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days following
submission. Seller and Buyer agree that judgment may be entered upon the
arbitral award of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
pursuant to _Section 10.9_. The cost of any arbitration (including the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses
of the parties) pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ shall be borne by Buyer and
Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by
the Accounting Firm, as arbitrators, at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The costs
and expenses incurred by the accountants, auditors and other Representatives
of any party hereto in connection with such partys review of the Statement
or otherwise in connection with the matters that are the subject of this
_Section 6.11_ shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses.

  



  

(f) If the sum of the Closing Net Inventory Value as finally determined
pursuant to subsections (d)-(e) (the " **Final Closing Net Inventory Value**
") and the amount of any check provided to Buyer with the Statement (if any)
is less than $5,300,000, Seller shall, within ten (10) business days after
the determination of the Final Closing Net Inventory Value, deliver to Buyer
a check payable to Buyer in the amount of the excess of (i) $5,300,000 over
(ii) the sum of the Final Closing Net Inventory Value and the amount of any
check provided to Buyer with the Statement (if any). Conversely, if the sum of
the Final Closing Net Inventory Value and the amount of any check provided to
Buyer with the Statement (if any) is more than $5,300,000, Buyer shall,
within ten (10) business days after the determination of the Final Closing
Net Inventory

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

Value, deliver to Seller a check payable to Seller in the amount by which the
sum of the Final Closing Net Inventory Value and the amount of any check
provided to Buyer with the Statement (if any) exceeds $5,300,000.

  



  

 **6.12** ** _Supplement to Disclosure Letter_.** Each of Buyer and
Seller may, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Closing,
supplement any Section of its respective Disclosure Letter to account for a
condition or event that renders untrue or inaccurate any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of this Agreement or with
respect to any matter that was or would have been required to be set forth or
described in the respective Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no supplement or amendment to any Disclosure Letter shall have any effect for
the purpose of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ or for purposes of determining whether any Person is in breach
of this Agreement or whether any Person is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Article IX_ or any other remedy at law or in equity (to the
extent available under the other terms of this Agreement).

  



  

 **6.13** ** _Tax Covenants_.**

  



  

(a) **_Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.** Seller and Buyer
will provide each other with such cooperation and information as any of
them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right
to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other
Proceeding in respect of Taxes. Any information obtained under this _Section
6.13(a)_ shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other Proceeding.

  



  

(b) **_Transfer Taxes_.**

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.13(b)(ii)_, Buyer
and Seller shall split equally the financial responsibility for all real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer, and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and other
fees, and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) The sales, use and transfer Tax Returns required by reason of the
transferring and recording of title to the Assets, if so required by Law,
shall be timely prepared by the party legally obligated to make such filing.
The party legally obligated to file any Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes
shall provide a copy of such Returns to Seller and Buyer at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due, along with a
calculation of the amount of Transfer Taxes payable by Buyer. The parties
agree to cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation and
filing of such Tax Returns, in obtaining all available exemptions from such
Transfer Taxes and in timely providing each other with resale certificates
and any other documents necessary to satisfy any such exemptions.  Each
party hereto shall execute and deliver all instruments and

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

certificates necessary to enable the other party or parties to comply with
the foregoing.

  



  

(c) **_Property Taxes_.** All real estate, personal property, and ad valorem
Taxes relating to the Assets which shall have become due and payable prior to
the Closing Date shall be paid by Seller. All such Taxes with respect to
taxable periods that include, but do not begin or end on, the Closing Date
shall be prorated to the Closing Date (such proration is to be based on the
number of days in the taxable period up to and including the Closing Date,
relative to the number of days in the entire taxable period). In connection
with such proration, in the event the actual Tax amounts are not available at
the Closing Date, proration of Taxes shall be based on 105% of the actual
Taxes for the preceding year for which actual Tax amounts are available.
 The amount due one party as a result of such proration shall be paid to the
other party at the Closing, provided, however, that in the event actual
Tax amounts are not available at the Closing Date, an appropriate
additional adjustment payment shall be made by one party to the other party
within ten days after such actual Tax amounts are assessed.

  



  

 **6.14** ** _Post-Closing Cooperation; Access and Assistance_.**

  



  

(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to cooperate with each other, after the Closing to
ensure the orderly transition of the Business from Seller to Buyer and to
minimize any disruption to the Business and to either party that might result
from the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, Buyer and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other and their respective Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the
Business (to the extent within the control of such party) as is reasonably
necessary for (i) financial reporting and accounting matters and (ii) defense
or prosecution of litigation and disputes.

  



  

(b) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer and Seller shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their respective
Representatives, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
(to the extent within the control of such party) relating to the Assets
(including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns, and making of any election related to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or other Proceeding related to any Tax Return.
 Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any audit or other Proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Business.

  



  

(c) In the event and for so long as any party hereto is contesting or
defending against any third-party Proceeding in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or
prior to the Closing Date involving the Business, the other party hereto
shall (x) fully cooperate with it and its counsel in, and assist it and its
counsel with, the contest or defense, (y) make available its personnel
(including for purposes of fact finding,

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

consultation, interviews, depositions and, if required, as witnesses), and
(z) provide such information, testimony and access to its books and records,
in each case as shall be reasonably requested in connection with the contest
or defense, all at the sole cost and expense (not including employee
compensation and benefits costs) of the contesting or defending party as
described in _Section 6.14(d)_ (unless the contesting or defending party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under  _Article IX_). For
the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.14(c)_ shall not apply with respect
to disputes between the parties hereto.

  



  

(d) Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the other in assisting such party pursuant to this
_Section 6.14_. No party shall be required by this _Section 6.14_ to take
any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business
or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (including, in the case of
Buyer, of the Business).

  



  

 **6.15** ** _Release of Liens_.** On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause any and all Liens other than Permitted Liens recorded against or
otherwise respecting the Assets to be satisfied and released in full and
shall cause the holders of such Liens to file all documents and make
all filings in all relevant jurisdictions necessary to release such Liens.
All such releases, filings and documentation shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

  



  

 **6.16** ** _Cooperation with Warranty Claims_.** Buyer agrees to process
and handle all warranty claims arising in respect of products of the
Business shipped or sold prior to the Closing, and to promptly inform Seller
of any material costs incurred by Buyer in processing and handling such
warranty claims. Buyer agrees to report to Seller any warranty claims being
processed under this _Section 6.16_ within two business days of the warranty
claim being reported to Buyer. Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer for all out-
of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by Buyer in performing
its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.16_.

  



  

 **6.17** ** _SEC Approval of Financial Statements_.** Buyer will use
its reasonable best efforts to apply to the SEC as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement for permission to use the Financial
Statements in Buyers required SEC filings following the Closing, provided
that (i) in no event shall such filing be made by Buyer more than five (5)
business days from the date hereof and (ii) Seller (and, as applicable, its
outside auditors) will reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection
therewith.

  



  

 **6.18** ** _Additional Financial Statements_.** If Seller is required
to provide (and does provide) additional financial statements to Buyer
pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section 7.2(g)_, such financial statements
provided to Buyer shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the period involved and shall fairly present in
all material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and
cash flows (in each case if required to be presented in such financial
statements) of the Business at the date or for the applicable period covered
thereby.

such indemnification is sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") in writing
within ten (10) business days of the event giving rise to such Indemnified
Partys claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis
of such claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification

shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If (i) such dispute
involves only monetary Damages (as opposed to any form of injunctive or other
equitable relief), and (ii) the parties are not able to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute within fourteen (14) days of the service of notice
as referenced above the following procedures shall be followed:

  



  

(a) Within thirty (30) days following the service of such notice, each of the
parties shall prepare and circulate to the other party (pursuant to _Section
10.4_ hereof) a memorandum or other form of statement setting out its
position on the matter in dispute and its reasons for adopting such position.
Each memorandum or statement shall be considered by the designated senior
officers of each of Buyer and Seller who shall endeavor to resolve the
dispute.  If the designated senior officers of each of Buyer and Seller agree

affiliated with either party to conduct non-binding mediation of the rights
of the respective parties with respect to such dispute.  The parties shall
cooperate with one another in selecting a mediator and in scheduling
mediation proceedings, shall act in good faith in such mediation, shall bear
their own respective expenses in connection with such mediation (except that
the parties shall share equally in the out-of-pocket cost of the mediation
itself), and shall use good faith efforts to cause such mediation to be
completed within thirty (30) days after the date on which the dispute
was submitted to mediation, provided that such mediation may be terminated
by either party in its sole discretion at any time more than forty five (45)
days after the date on which the dispute was submitted to mediation.

  



  

(c) In the event that (A) the dispute is not a dispute described in clause
(i) above or (B) resolution of the dispute is not agreed upon after
completion of such mediation, either party may submit the dispute to a court
of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

 **9.4** ** _Third Party Claims_.**

Party Claim** "), such Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing of the Third Party Claim (which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the events giving rise to such Third Party Claim) within ten (10)
business days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party may also
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party.  Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof.  If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall control
such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of one (1) outside counsel (and not any fees and expenses allocated
to any internal counsel) employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
(other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If
the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim,
all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees and Representatives reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its
terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Damages in
connection with such Third Party Claim and does not impose any material
obligations or material restrictions on the Indemnified Party in any manner,
which settlement, compromise, or discharge shall then release the
Indemnifying Party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim.

  



  

 **9.5** ** _Limitations and Requirements_.**

  



  

(a) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against Damages pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ of this Agreement
unless and until the aggregate of all such Damages suffered or incurred by
Buyer and such Persons exceeds $750,000 (the " **Basket Amount** ") (in
which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification for the full amount of such Damages, including the
first $750,000 thereof).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties against Damages pursuant
to _Section 9.1(a)_ to the extent that payments thereof to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceeds the
Escrow Fund; provided, however, that the indemnification liability of Seller
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ through  _Section 9.1(d)_ shall be unlimited.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties against Damages
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ of this Agreement unless and until the
aggregate of all such Damages suffered or incurred by Seller and such Persons
exceeds $250,000 (in which event the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification for the full amount of such Damages, including
the first $250,000 thereof).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties against Damages
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ to the extent that payments thereof to the
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceeds
$2,400,000;   _provided, however,_ that the

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

indemnification liability of Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ through
_Section 9.2(e)_ shall be unlimited.

  



  

(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ may or shall be made unless
written notice pursuant to _Section 9.3_ or _Section 9.4_, as applicable,
is delivered to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(f) Buyer acknowledges, on behalf of itself and on behalf of the other Buyer
Indemnified Parties, that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the related agreements and documents
contemplated hereby and executed and delivered by Seller at the Closing shall
be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_
(other than claims and causes of action based on criminal fraud). In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, on behalf of itself and
each of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims and causes of action based on criminal fraud) it may have against
Seller arising under or based upon any applicable Law or otherwise (except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_).

  



  

(g) Upon payment in full of any Inter-Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.3_
or the payment of any Judgment with respect to a Third Party Claim pursuant
to _Section 9.4_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent
of such payment to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person
(other than the Buyer Indemnified Parties) with respect to the subject matter
of such Inter-Party Claim or Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Parties
shall assign or otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties,
at the cost and expense of the Indemnified Parties, to pursue any claims
against, or otherwise recover amounts from, any Person liable or responsible
for any Damages for which indemnification has been received pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(h) The waiver by either Buyer or Seller of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ , respectively, based upon the accuracy of any
representation or warranty or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification,
reimbursement or other remedy based upon such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party hereto shall be
entitled to be indemnified against any Damages based upon or arising from any
claim to the extent such claim is taken into account in determining the
amounts (if any) due to and paid to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
pursuant to _Section 6.11_.

  



  

 **9.6** ** _Calculation and Mitigation of Damages_.**

  



  

(a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article IX_ shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by
such Indemnified Party under insurance policies or other collateral sources
with respect to such Damages. In the event any amounts recovered or
recoverable under insurance policies or other

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

collateral sources are not received before any claim for indemnification is
actually paid pursuant to this _Article IX_, then the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall pursue such insurance policies or collateral sources, and in
the event a Buyer Indemnified Party receives any recovery, the amount of such
recovery shall be applied first, to refund any payments made by the
Indemnifying Parties which would not have been so paid had such recovery been
obtained prior to such payment, and second, any excess to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties. If a Buyer Indemnified Party fails to pursue recoveries
under any "incurrence" based insurance policies or other collateral sources,
then Seller shall have the right of subrogation to pursue such insurance
policies or other collateral sources and may take any reasonable actions
necessary to pursue such rights of subrogation in its name or the name of the
party from whom subrogation is obtained. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, with
Seller to pursue any such subrogation claim.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
"Damages" shall not include any consequential, incidental or indirect
damages, special or punitive damages, including loss of revenue, profits or
income, diminution in value or loss of business reputation or opportunity.

  



  

(c) Buyer and Seller agree to treat any indemnification payments received
pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

  



  

 **9.7** ** _Termination of Indemnification_.** The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_
shall terminate with respect to claims made pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_
or  _Section 9.2(a)_ when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to _Section 10.1_; provided, however, that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
pursuant to _Section 9.3_ or _Section 9.4_ to the Indemnifying Party. The
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party under this
_Article IX_ shall terminate with respect to claims made pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)-(d)_ or  _Section 9.2(b)-(e)_, (X) with respect to claims
pursuant to _Section 6.8_, ninety (90) days following the third anniversary
of the Closing Date, or (Y) with respect to claims pursuant to any other
covenant or obligation, upon the expiration of the statute of limitations
that would apply under applicable law to such claim if brought in a court of
competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which
the Indemnified Party shall have, before the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating
in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to _Section 9.3_ or
_Section 9.4_ to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

 **9.8** ** _Escrow Fund_.**

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after
the Closing, any payments made to any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of
any claim

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

for indemnification made pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ shall be satisfied
solely from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

(b) No later than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release to Seller the Escrow Fund (the " **Escrow Payment** ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if at any time prior to the date on which the
Escrow Payment is due to be released, Buyer (or another Buyer Indemnified
Party) has reasonably and in good faith asserted a claim or claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.3_ or _9.4_  that, individually
or when aggregated with the other such claims made by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, is for Damages in excess of the Basket Amount (an "
**Excess Claim** "), and such Excess Claim is pending or unresolved, Buyer and
Seller agree to promptly thereafter jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing to withhold from the Escrow Payment a number of shares and/or amount
of cash, if any, having an aggregate value equal to the amount of such Excess
Claims (in the aggregate) until such matters are resolved. For all
purposes of the Escrow Fund, shares of Buyer Common Stock included in the
Escrow Fund shall be valued at the Issuance Price.  If it is finally
determined, by the agreement of Buyer and Seller or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction, that any part or all
of such Excess Claims are covered by _Section 9.1_, (i) the covered amount
of such Excess Claims may be offset against the retained portion of the
Escrow Fund, and, if such offset amount is greater than the Basket Amount,
Buyer and Seller shall promptly thereafter jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
in writing to release shares and/or cash, if any, having an aggregate value
equal to such offset amount (including the Basket Amount) to Buyer; and (ii)
Buyer and Seller shall promptly thereafter jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
in writing (assuming that at such time the 12-month anniversary of the
Closing Date has passed) to release the remainder of the Escrow Payment to
Seller. If it is finally determined that any such Excess Claim is not covered
by _Section 9.1_ (again assuming that at such time the 12-month anniversary
of the Closing Date has passed) Buyer and Seller shall promptly thereafter
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to release all amounts withheld
with respect to such Excess Claim to Seller. At any time prior to
distribution of the entire Escrow Fund pursuant to this _Section
9.8_, Seller may exchange any or all of the shares of Buyer Common Stock in
the Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent for cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent in an amount equal to the
Issuance Price multiplied by the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock so
exchanged. Upon receipt of such wire transfer, the Escrow Agent shall
immediately deliver to Seller certificates in the name of Seller representing
the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock so exchanged and such shares shall
be considered released from the Escrow Fund and, upon receipt by Seller, no
longer subject to the terms of this Agreement. Dividends, distributions and
other income earned on the Escrow Fund (including on the investment or
reinvestment thereof) shall be payable to Seller as part of the Escrow
Payment. Buyer shall, however, be entitled to dividends, distributions and
other income earned on that portion (if any) of the Escrow Fund (including on
the investment or reinvestment thereof) to which Buyer is entitled as a
result of a claim (or claims) by Buyer which is ultimately resolved as
provided above in favor of Buyer (and Seller shall, if it receives any such
dividends, distributions and other income from the Escrow Agent, promptly
forward such amounts to Buyer).
