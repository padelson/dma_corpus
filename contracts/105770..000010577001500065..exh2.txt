     2.8  Adjustment Amount and Payment

     (a) The Base Amount shall be adjusted (the "Adjusted Amount") by adding to
or subtracting from, as applicable, the Working Capital Adjustment, the Net
Intercompany Balance and the Workers' Compensation Excess, if any, as follows:

         (i)    the Base Amount shall be increased or decreased (such increase
         or decrease to be referred to as the "Working Capital Adjustment"), on
         a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that the Closing Working
         Capital is greater than or less than $11,096,000 (the "Initial Working
         Capital"). The Initial Working Capital shall be set forth in Schedule
         2.8(a)(i);

         (ii)   the Base Amount shall be increased or decreased, on a
         dollar-for-dollar basis, to the extent that the Net Intercompany
         Balance (as defined below) shows net advances from Stockholder to
         Seller or net distributions


                                                                              20


<PAGE>

         from Seller to Stockholder, as the case may be, and any amounts owing
         to Seller from Stockholder or from Stockholder to Seller with respect
         thereto shall be discharged;

         (iii)  the Base Amount shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis,
         to the extent that the Closing Workers' Compensation Reserve is
         greater than $2,277,000 (the "Initial Workers' Compensation Reserve"),
         with such excess being referred to herein as the "Workers'
         Compensation Excess".

     (b) If the Adjusted Amount is less than the Base Amount, the difference
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds by Seller to an
account specified by Buyer. If the Adjusted Amount is greater than the Base
Amount, the difference shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by Buyer (or Parent) to an account specified by Seller. All payments shall
be made together with interest at the Bank of America Prime Rate in effect as of
the Closing Date, which interest shall begin accruing on the Closing Date and
end on the date that the payment is made. Within three (3) Business Days after
the calculation of the Adjusted Amount becomes binding and conclusive on the
Parties pursuant to this Section 2.8 and Section 2.9 of this Agreement, Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be, shall make the wire transfer payment provided for
in this Section 2.8.

2.9  Adjustment Procedure

     (a) "Closing Working Capital" shall mean the amount calculated by
subtracting the current liabilities of Seller (determined in accordance with
GAAP as modified by the Accounting Principles, but excluding any workers'
compensation reserve) from the current assets of Seller (determined in
accordance with GAAP as modified by the Accounting Principles) as of the Closing
Date. The categories of current liabilities (excluding any workers' compensation
reserve) and current assets are identified in the Interim Balance Sheet.

     (b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, Seller shall (i) prepare and deliver to Buyer and
Parent an unaudited statement of Closing Working Capital, prepared on the same
basis and applying the same accounting principles, policies and practices that
were used in calculating the Initial Working Capital, including the principles,
policies and practices set forth on Schedule 3.2 hereto, except that the
accrual, if any, for cash bonuses to be paid to Seller's Bonus Plan Participants
in respect of the year 2001 shall be established in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.9(d) (the "Closing Working Capital
Statement"); (ii) prepare and deliver to Buyer and Parent an unaudited statement
(the "Net Intercompany Balance Statement") showing the cash advances made by
Stockholder to Seller and cash distributions from Seller to Stockholder, which
advances and distributions are attributable to the purchase or sale of
non-current assets, during the period from July 1, 2001 through the Closing
Date, and the net


                                                                              21


<PAGE>

balance owed to Stockholder from Seller or from Seller to Stockholder as a
result of such intercompany activity during such period (the "Net Intercompany
Balance"); (iii) arrange for the preparation and delivery to Buyer and Parent an
actuarial report and workers' compensation reserve calculation as at the Closing
Date (the "Closing Workers' Compensation Reserve", with such report being
referred to herein as the "Closing Workers' Compensation Reserve Statement") to
be performed by Willis Corroon Advanced Risk Management Services, which shall be
prepared using the same methodologies and principles as contained in that firm's
report dated December 7, 2000, and attached hereto as Exhibit 2.9(b); and (iv)
prepare and deliver a statement setting forth the Adjusted Amount (the "Adjusted
Amount Statement" and, together with the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Closing Workers' Compensation Reserve Statement and the Net Intercompany Balance
Statement, the "Closing Statements").

     (c) Seller shall have full access to the personnel, properties, Contracts,
books, Records and all other documents and data relating to the conduct or
operation of the Assets during normal business hours for purposes of this
Section 2.9.

     (d) The amount of the bonus accrual on the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be determined as follows:

         (i)    If the Final Bonus Payout Amount has been determined within
         sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, then the amount of the bonus
         accrual on the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be equal to the
         Final Bonus Payout Amount; and

         (ii)   If the Final Bonus Payout Amount has not been determined within
         such sixty (60) day period, then the amount of the bonus accrual on
         the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be equal to the amount of
         the bonus accrual on the Interim Balance Sheet, and shall be subject
         to further adjustment as set forth in Section 10.3.

     (e) Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days after the delivery by Seller of
the Closing Statements and the associated work papers (the "Review Period"),
complete its review of such Closing Statements. During the Review Period, Buyer
shall have access to Seller's work papers relating to the Closing Statements.
Buyer agrees that Seller's delivering, or otherwise making available to Buyer,
Seller's work paper shall be sufficient to commence the Review Period. The
Parties agree that the Adjusted Amount is intended to show the Net Intercompany
Balance and the change in the Initial Working Capital Amount and any increase to
the Initial Workers' Compensation Reserve from July 1, 2001 to the Closing Date,
and that such Net Intercompany Balance and such changes in the Initial Working
Capital Amount and any increase to the Initial Workers' Compensation Reserve may
only be measured if the Closing Statements are prepared in the same way, using
the same methodologies and accounting practices (including with respect to
determining estimates and allowances), at both dates. The Adjusted Amount
calculation shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by,

                                                                              22


<PAGE>

Buyer unless Buyer shall have notified Seller in writing during the Review
Period of any good faith objection thereto, which objection can only be that the
Closing Statements have not been prepared in accordance with this Section 2.9 or
the Adjusted Amount calculation contains mathematical errors on its face (the
"Buyer's Objection"), which shall be accompanied by a written report signed by
Buyer's independent auditors that the positions taken by Buyer in the Buyer's
Objection are not inconsistent with GAAP (as modified by the Accounting
Principles); provided that Buyer may not deliver more than one Buyer's Objection
and may not amend its Buyer's Objection once it has been delivered to Seller.
The Buyer's Objection shall set forth a reasonably specific description of the
basis of Buyer's Objection and the specific adjustments to the Adjusted Amount
calculation which Buyer believes should be made. Any items not disputed in a
valid Buyer's Objection delivered within the Review Period shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Buyer. Buyer agrees that it shall not object to or
otherwise challenge the Adjusted Amount calculation other than as provided in
this Section 2.9. In the event of such a dispute, Seller and Buyer shall attempt
to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amount shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties.

     (f) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disputes with
respect to the Adjusted Amount calculation within fifteen (15) Business Days
following Seller's receipt of Buyer's Objection to such Adjusted Amount
calculation pursuant to Section 2.9(e), they shall refer their remaining
differences to Arthur Andersen, LLP, or if such accounting firm is unable to so
act, such accounting firm as to which Seller and Buyer mutually agree (the
selected accounting firm, hereinafter referred to as the "Independent
Accountants") for decision, which decision shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties upon delivery of the written opinion set forth in
sub-clause (iii) below. The procedure and schedule under which any dispute shall
be submitted to the Independent Accountants shall be as follows:

         (i)    Within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Review
         Period, Buyer shall submit any unresolved elements of its Buyer's
         Objection to the Independent Accountants in writing (with a copy to
         Seller), supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it
         relies.

         (ii)   Within thirty (30) days following Buyer's submission of the
         unresolved elements of Buyer's Objection as specified in sub-clause
         (i) above, Seller shall submit its response to the Independent
         Accountants in writing (with a copy to Buyer), supported by any
         documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies.

         (iii)  The Independent Accountants shall deliver their written opinion
         within twenty (20) days (or such longer period of time as the
         Independent Accountants determine is necessary, not to exceed thirty
         (30) days) following its receipt of the information provided for in
         sub-clause (ii) above. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
         Independent Accountants

                                                                              23


<PAGE>

         is limited to the unresolved portion of the Buyer's Objection. Buyer
         and Seller shall make readily available to the Independent Accountants
         all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of
         the Parties' respective independent auditors and actuaries) relating
         to the preparation of the Closing Statements and the calculation of
         the Adjusted Amount and all other items reasonably requested by the
         Independent Accountants.

     Any expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accountants
shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller so that Buyer's share of such costs
shall be in the same proportion that (x) the aggregate amount of the disputed
items submitted by Buyer to the Independent Accountants that are unsuccessfully
disputed bears to (y) the total amount of all disputed items submitted by Buyer
to the Independent Accountants. Seller and Buyer shall each bear the fees of
their respective auditors and other advisors and consultants incurred in
connection with the determination and review of the Adjusted Amount calculation.

     (g) The Adjusted Amount calculation shall become final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Buyer's Objection has
been given, the expiration of the Review Period, (ii) agreement in writing by
Seller and Buyer that the Adjusted Amount calculation, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by Seller and Buyer, shall be final, binding and
conclusive and (iii) the date on which the Independent Accountants shall issue
their written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such
Adjusted Amount calculation.

     (h) Any reduction in the Adjusted Amount as a result of the inclusion of an
item (including any reserves) in the calculation of the Adjusted Amount
(regardless of whether notice of a Buyer's Objection has been given) shall be
the sole remedy of Buyer and Parent with respect to such item. Notwithstanding
anything set forth herein to the contrary (including, but not limited to, the
provisions of Articles 9 and 11), neither Buyer nor Parent shall be permitted to
assert a claim for indemnification or a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement with respect to any matter raised in a Buyer's Objection
regardless of the outcome of such Buyer's Objection. Notwithstanding anything
set forth herein to the contrary, no adjustment shall be made to the Adjusted
Amount to the extent that such adjustment relates to a Retained Liability.

2.10 Consents

     If there are any Consents relating to Contracts, which have not yet been
obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) as of the Closing Date
(the "Restricted Contracts"), notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.4, neither this
Agreement nor the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Assumption Agreement nor any
other document related to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or
delivery, or an attempted sale,

                                                                              24


<PAGE>

assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery, of the Restricted
Contracts, and following the Closing, the Parties shall use Best Efforts, and
cooperate with each other, to obtain the Consent relating to each Restricted
Contract as quickly as practicable.

     Pending the obtaining of such Consents relating to any Restricted Contract,
the Parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of use of the Restricted
Contract for its term (or any right or benefit arising thereunder, including the
enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller against a
Third Party thereunder) and the performance by Buyer of Seller's Liabilities
thereunder. Once a Consent for the sale, assignment, assumption, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of a Restricted Contract is obtained, Seller shall
promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted Contract to Buyer,
and Buyer shall assume the obligations under such Restricted Contract assigned
to Buyer from and after the date of assignment to Buyer pursuant to a
special-purpose assignment and assumption agreement substantially similar in
terms to those of the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Assumption Agreement (which
special-purpose agreement the Parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good
faith at the time of such transfer, all at no additional cost to Buyer,
Stockholder or Seller).

<PAGE>


     (e) by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

9.2  Effect of Termination

     In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9.1 hereof, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no
effect, and no Party hereto shall have any liability to any other Party hereto
or their respective affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the
obligations of the Parties hereto contained in this Section 9.2, Article 12 or

any Party from liability for, or affect the remedies available to any Party at
law or in equity with respect to, any bad faith acts or willful breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination.

10.  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

10.1 Payment of all Taxes Resulting From Sale of Assets

     Buyer shall pay in a timely manner all Taxes resulting from or payable in
connection with the sale of the Assets (other than Seller's income Taxes)
pursuant to this Agreement, regardless of the Person on whom such Taxes are
imposed by Legal Requirements.

10.2 Clinical Manufacturing Suite

     The parties acknowledge and agree that Stockholder currently uses a
clean-room manufacturing suite of approximately 6,000 square feet at the
Facilities (the "Clinical Trials Manufacturing Suite"), as well as
controlled-substance storage space and related support services at the
Facilities, to develop and produce clinical-trial samples for Stockholder's
drug-delivery division. Stockholder will require continuation of the development
and production of such clinical trial samples after the Closing Date.
Accordingly, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Stockholder and Buyer
will negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable arrangement to allow
Stockholder to retain such capability for up to three years following the
Closing Date. Such arrangement may be in the form of a lease-back of the
Clinical Trials Manufacturing Suite, a contract-manufacturing and supply

Stockholder's development personnel (consistent with Buyer's cGMP procedures and
other Legal Requirements) and capacity access on a preferred basis.

10.3 Payment of Bonuses

     (a) Each of the Seller's Bonus Plan Participants participates in
Stockholder's Management Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"), which provides
eligible employee participants of Stockholder and its subsidiaries the
opportunity to receive a cash bonus ("Bonus"). Bonus payouts under the Bonus
Plan are based on

                                                                              51


<PAGE>

achievement of corporate financial performance targets and individual
objectives. The target bonus opportunity for each Bonus Plan participant,
including the Seller's Bonus Plan Participants, is expressed as a percentage of
the participant's base salary (as set forth on Schedule 3.20 with respect to
Seller's Bonus Plan Participants). However, the actual amount to be paid out
under the Bonus Plan to Bonus Plan participants, including the Seller's Bonus
Plan Participants, will depend on a final determination of the Compensation
Committee of Stockholder's board of Directors (the "Committee").

     (b) Promptly following the Committee's final determination, Stockholder
shall deliver to Buyer and Parent a notice of the final amounts, if any, of
Bonuses approved for the Seller's Bonus Plan Participants, which amounts shall
be calculated in the same manner as all other Bonus Plan participants (the
"Final Bonus Payout Amount"). Within 15 days following receipt of such notice,
or March 15, 2002, whichever occurs later, Buyer shall pay to each of the
Seller's Bonus Plan Participants a cash payment equal to the Bonus amount
designated in the Final Bonus Payout Amount. Buyer, Parent, Seller and
Stockholder shall use their respective Best Efforts to deliver Bonuses to each
Seller's Bonus Plan Participant who, at the time Bonuses are to be paid, is not
an employee of Buyer, Parent or any of their respective Related Persons. If, for
any reason, Buyer shall fail to pay all or any portion of the Bonus Amount
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.3, Buyer shall remit, on
or before April 5, 2002, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by Seller (or Stockholder, at Stockholder's election), any
unpaid portion of the Final Bonus Payout Amount.

     (c) To the extent that the Final Bonus Payout Amount exceeds the bonus
accrual set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statement, within 15 Business
Days of the date of the notice referred to in Section 10.3(b), Seller or
Stockholder shall pay to Buyer or Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by Buyer (or Parent at Parent's
election), an amount equal to the difference between the Final Bonus Payout
Amount and the bonus accrual set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statement.
To the extent that the Final Bonus Payout Amount is less than the bonus accrual
set forth on the Closing Working Capital Statement, within 15 Business Days of
the date of the notice referred to in Section 10.3(b), Buyer or Parent shall pay
to Seller or Stockholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by Seller (or Stockholder at Stockholder's election), an
amount equal to the difference between the bonus accrual set forth on the
Closing Working Capital Statement and the Final Bonus Payout Amount.

10.4 Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation

     (a) Noncompetition. For a period of three years after the Closing Date,
Stockholder shall not, and shall cause all Related Persons that it controls not
to, anywhere in the U.S., directly or indirectly invest in, own, manage,
operate, finance, control, advise, render services to or guarantee the
obligations of, any Person engaged in or planning to become engaged in the
contract packaging and manufacturing

                                                                              52

business ("Competing Business"); provided, however, that Stockholder, and
Related Persons controlled by Stockholder, may purchase or otherwise acquire up
to (but not more than) five percent of any class of the securities of any Person
(but may not otherwise participate in the activities of such Person) if such
securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have
been registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act; provided, further, that
this clause (a) shall not apply to, or otherwise limit, the ability of any
Person that acquires Stockholder by way of tender offer, merger, consolidation,
asset sale or otherwise from engaging in a Competing Business.

     (b) Nonsolicitation. For a period of three years after the Closing Date,
Seller and Stockholder shall not directly or indirectly:

         (i)    cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any customer,
         supplier, licensee, licensor or franchisee of Buyer to cease doing
         business with Buyer, to deal with any competitor of Buyer, or in any
         way materially and adversely alter its relationship with Buyer;

         (ii)   cause, induce or attempt to cause or induce any customer,
         supplier, licensee, licensor or franchisee of Seller on the Closing
         Date or within the year preceding the Closing Date to cease doing
         business with Buyer, to deal with any competitor of Buyer, or in any
         way interfere with its relationship with Buyer; or

         (iii)  hire, retain or attempt to hire or retain any employee or
         independent contractor of Buyer, or in any way interfere with the
         relationship between any Buyer and any of its employees or independent
         contractors.

     Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, this clause (b)
shall not apply to, or otherwise limit, the ability of any Person that acquires
Stockholder by way of tender offer, merger, consolidation, asset sale or
otherwise from engaging in any activity addressed in clauses (b)(i)-(iv).

     (c) Intentionally Omitted.

     (d) Modification of Covenant. If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of
competent jurisdiction determines that any term or provision contained in
Section 10.4(a) or (b) is invalid or unenforceable, then the Parties agree that
the court or tribunal will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or
geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This Section 10.4
will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which
the judgment may be appealed. This Section 10.4 is reasonable and necessary to
protect and preserve Buyer's legitimate business interests and the value of the
Assets and to prevent any unfair advantage being conferred on Seller.

                                                                              53

applicable law or (2) no group health plan is maintained by Seller or any other
employer under common control, within the meaning of section 414(b) or (c) of
the Code, with Seller on the Closing Date.

10.9 Employment Taxes

     The Parties acknowledge that, for FICA, FUTA and New Jersey state
employment Tax purposes, Buyer will qualify as a successor employer with respect
to any employees who are employed by Seller prior to the Closing and by Buyer
following the Closing. In connection with the foregoing, the Parties agree to

11.7 Intentionally Omitted

11.8 Third-Party Claims

     All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Person hereunder shall be
asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section 11.8. In the event that any
written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Person would be liable to any
Indemnified Person hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from
any Indemnified Person by a Third Party, such Indemnified Person shall promptly,
but in no event more than fifteen (15) days following such Indemnified Person's
receipt of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Person of such claim or
demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice"); provided that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Person shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Person). The Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from
the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to
notify the Indemnified Person whether or not it desires to defend the
Indemnified Person against such claim or demand. An election to assume the
defense of such claim or demand shall not be deemed to be an admission that the
Indemnifying Person is liable to the Indemnified Person in respect of such claim
or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in
defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by,
the Indemnifying Person, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article
11. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Person
is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold the Indemnified Person harmless
from and against any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall reimburse
the Indemnifying Person for any and all reasonable and properly documented out
of pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, attorney's fees and
court costs) incurred by the Indemnifying Person in its defense of the
Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the
Indemnified Person within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Person against such claim or demand, except as hereinafter provided,
the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Person by
appropriate Proceedings. If any Indemnified Person desires to participate in,
but not control, any such defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost
and expense. The Indemnified Person shall not settle a claim or demand without
the consent of the Indemnifying Person, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The

                                                                              59


<PAGE>

Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, settle, compromise
or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand except for settlements
which are solely monetary in nature and would reasonably be expected to not have
a significant adverse effect on the continuing conduct and operation of the
Assets. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to defend the Indemnified Person
against a claim or demand for which the Indemnifying Person has an
indemnification obligation hereunder, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Person timely notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any such
claim or demand, or, if the same be contested by the Indemnified Person, then
that portion thereof as to which such defense is unsuccessful (and the
reasonable and properly documented out of pocket costs and expenses pertaining
to such defense) shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Person hereunder,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 11. To the extent the
Indemnifying Person shall control or participate in the defense or settlement of
any Third-Party Claim or demand, the Indemnifying Person will give the
Indemnified Person and its counsel access to, during normal business hours, the
relevant business records and other documents, and shall permit them to consult
with the counsel of the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnifying Person shall use
its Best Efforts in the defense of all claims it elects to defend. Any notice of
a claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement shall state with reasonable specificity the
representation, warranty or covenant with respect to which the claim is made,
and, to the extent known at such time, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis
for the claim, and the estimated amount of the liability asserted against the
Indemnifying Person by reason of the claim.

     With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this Article 11, the Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve
in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreements) and the
attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each Party
agrees that: (i) it will use its Best Efforts, in respect of any Third-Party
Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid
production of Confidential Information (consistent with applicable Legal
Requirements and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any
Party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

11.9 Procedure for Indemnification - Other Claims

     A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought
and shall be paid promptly after such notice.

                                                                              60

11.10 Sole Remedy

     The Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be the Parties' sole and
exclusive remedy (other than injunctive relief or specific performance) with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties hereby waive and
release, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any)
known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the
future, that it may have against any Indemnifying Person, arising under or based
upon any national, federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation or judicial decision or the common law (including, without
limitation, any such statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or judicial
decision relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any
securities law, common law or otherwise) in respect of the subject matter of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. It is the Parties' intention
that the indemnification provisions in this Agreement shall control and
determine Seller's Stockholder's and Buyer's respective rights and obligations
with respect to any Damages. This Section 11.10 shall survive Closing.

11.11 Time Limitations

     (a) If the Closing occurs, Seller and Stockholder will have liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to (i) any material Breach of a
covenant or obligation to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date
(other than those relating to Retained Liabilities or set forth in Section 10.4
or Article 12, as to which a claim may be made at any time) or (ii) any Breach
of a representation or warranty (other than a representation or warranty set
forth in Section 3.1, the first sentence of Section 3.3, or Section 3.14 or any
Retained Liabilities for which there shall be no time limitation and other than
a representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.12 for which a claim may be
made at any time within the applicable statute of limitations) but only if on or
before the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer, in good faith,
notifies Seller or Stockholder of a claim specifying the factual basis of the
claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer.

     (b) If the Closing occurs, Parent and Buyer will have liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to (i) any material Breach of a
covenant or obligation to be performed or complied with prior to the Closing
Date (other than those relating to Assumed Liabilities or set forth in Section
10.10 or Article 12, as to which a claim may be made at any time) or (ii) any
Breach of a representation or warranty (other than a representation or warranty
set forth in Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4 or any Assumed Liability or payment to
Seller pursuant to Section 2.3 for which there shall be no time limitation), but
only if on or before the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller
or Stockholder, in good faith, notify Parent and Buyer of a claim specifying the
factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by
Buyer.

                                                                              61


<PAGE>


11.12 No Consequential or Special Damages

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnifying
Person shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to any Indemnified Person for
consequential, special incidental or punitive damages that arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions or the performance or
breach thereof.

11.13 Losses Net of Insurance, Etc.

      The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
Sections 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4 shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Person pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification
agreement with any Third Party, or (ii) any insurance proceeds (not including
self insurance) or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received as
an offset against such Damages (each source named in clauses (i) and (ii), a
"Collateral Source"). The Parties shall take and shall cause their
Representatives to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give
rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the extent reasonably necessary
to remedy a breach that gives rise to the Damages. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that, to the extent permitted, the Indemnifying Person shall have a right
of subrogation against all available Collateral Sources with respect to the
Damages. To the extent such right of subrogation is not permitted, the
Indemnified Person agrees, at the Indemnifying Person's sole cost and expense,
to use all reasonable efforts to seek recovery from all such Collateral Sources
which recoveries shall inure to, and be for the benefit of, the Indemnifying
Person. The Indemnifying Person may require an Indemnified Person to assign the
rights to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided, that the
Indemnifying Person will then be responsible for pursuing such recovery at its
own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required
under this Article 11 is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Person of
any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Person pursuant to
this Article 11, the Indemnified Person shall repay to the Indemnifying Person,
promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Person would
not have had to pay pursuant to this Article 11 had such determination been made
at the time of such payment.

12.  CONFIDENTIALITY

12.1 Confidential Information

     The Confidentiality Agreements, dated November 16, 2000 and August 17,
2001, between Buyer and Seller (the "Confidentiality Agreements") shall survive
the Closing and remain in full force and effect.

                                                                              62

13.2 Publicity

     No Party shall, directly or indirectly through any of its Representatives,
issue any press release or otherwise publicly disseminate any document or other
written material relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
unless the other Parties shall have approved such press release or written
material (it being understood that no Party may unreasonably withhold or delay
its approval of any such press release or written material). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Stockholder shall have been advised by its legal counsel that the
issuance of such press release or the dissemination of such written material is
required by any applicable law or regulation, and Stockholder shall have
consulted with Buyer and Parent prior to issuing such press release or
disseminating such written material, Stockholder shall be entitled to (i) file

Form 8-K, together with a copy of this Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto)
and the press release (which shall have been previously presented to Buyer and
Parent) announcing the Closing.

13.3 No Waiver; Etc.

     Neither any failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in
this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and,
except as otherwise provided herein, no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of

                                                                              63


<PAGE>

any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of
the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in
whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in
writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party
will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and
(c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of that Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

13.4 Entire Agreement and Modification

     This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreements, supersedes
all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties with respect
to its subject matter (including any letter of intent) and constitutes (along
with the Confidentiality Agreements, Schedules, Exhibits and other documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the
terms of the agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter.
This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by
a written agreement executed by the Party to be charged with the amendment.

     (a) The information in the attached Schedules constitute (i) exceptions to
particular representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller and
Stockholder as set forth in this Agreement or (ii) descriptions or lists of
assets and liabilities and other items referred to in this Agreement. If there
is any inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement and those in the
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Schedules
with respect to a representation or warranty), the statements in this Agreement
will control.

     (b) The statements in the Schedules, and those in any supplement thereto,
shall be deemed to be an inclusion to each other Schedule to this Agreement
where the relevance thereof is readily apparent. Inclusion of any item on the
Schedules shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller,
Stockholder or Buyer or otherwise imply that any such matter is material or
creates a measure for, or further defines the meaning of, materiality or any
correlative terms for the purposes of this Agreement.

13.6 Governing Law

     This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the law of the State
of New Jersey without regard to conflicts of law principles that would require
the application of any other law.
